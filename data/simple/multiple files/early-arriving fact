in the data warehouse practice of etl an early fact or early arriving fact 1 denotes the detection of a dimensional natural key during fact table source loading prior to the assignment of a corresponding primary key or surrogate key in the dimension table hence the fact which cites the dimension arrives early relative to the definition of the dimension value procedurally an early fact can be treated as an error on the presumption that the dimensional attribute values should have been collected before fact source loading a valid fact whose collection pauses whilst the missing dimensional attribute value itself is collected a valid fact where a primary key value is generated on the dimension with no attributes stub dummy row the fact completes processing and the dimension attributes are populated overwritten later in the load processing on the new row edit references kimball ralph design tip 57 early arriving facts august 2004 v t e data warehouse 160 creating the data warehouse concepts database dimension dimensional modeling fact olap star schema aggregate variants anchor modeling column oriented dbms data vault modeling holap molap rolap operational data store elements data dictionary metadata data mart sixth normal form surrogate key fact fact table early arriving fact measure dimension dimension table degenerate slowly changing filling extract transform load etl extract transform load 160 using the data warehouse concepts business intelligence dashboard data mining decision support system dss olap cube languages data mining extensions dmx multidimensional expressions mdx xml for analysis xmla tools business intelligence tools reporting software spreadsheet 160 related people bill inmon ralph kimball products comparison of olap servers data warehousing products and their producers
