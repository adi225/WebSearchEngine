in statistics exploratory data analysis eda is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics in easy to understand form often with visual graphs without using a statistical model or having formulated a hypothesis exploratory data analysis was promoted by john tukey to encourage statisticians visually to examine their data sets to formulate hypotheses that could be tested on new data sets tukey s championing of eda encouraged the development of statistical computing packages especially s at bell labs the s programming language inspired the systems s plus and r this family of statistical computing environments featured vastly improved dynamic visualization capabilities which allowed statisticians to identify outliers trends and patterns in data that merited further study tukey s eda was related to two other developments in statistical theory robust statistics and nonparametric statistics both of which tried to reduce the sensitivity of statistical inferences to errors in formulating statistical models tukey promoted the use of five number summary of numerical data the two extremes maximum and minimum the median and the quartiles because these median and quartiles being functions of the empirical distribution are defined for all distributions unlike the mean and standard deviation moreover the quartiles and median are more robust to skewed or heavy tailed distributions than traditional summaries the mean and standard deviation the packages s s plus and r included routines using resampling statistics such as quenouille and tukey s jackknife and efron s bootstrap which are nonparametric and robust for many problems exploratory data analysis robust statistics nonparametric statistics and the development of statistical programming languages facilitated statisticians work on scientific and engineering problems such problems included the fabrication of semiconductors and the understanding of communications networks which concerned bell labs these statistical developments all championed by tukey were designed to complement the analytic theory of testing statistical hypotheses particularly the laplacian tradition

emphasis in statistics was placed on statistical hypothesis testing confirmatory data analysis more emphasis needed to be placed on using data to suggest hypotheses to test in particular he held that confusing the two types of analyses and employing them on the same set of data can lead to systematic bias owing to the issues inherent in testing hypotheses suggested by the data the objectives of eda are to suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments many eda techniques have been adopted into data mining and are being taught to young students as a way to introduce them to statistical thinking 2 edit techniques there are a number of tools that are useful for eda but eda is characterized more by the attitude taken than by particular techniques 3 typical graphical techniques used in eda are box plot histogram multi vari chart run chart pareto chart scatter plot stem and leaf plot odds ratio multidimensional scaling targeted projection pursuit principal component analysis typical quantitative techniques are median polish the trimean ordination edit history many eda ideas can be traced back to earlier authors for example francis galton emphasized order statistics and quantiles arthur lyon bowley used precursors of the stemplot and five number summary bowley actually used a seven figure summary including the extremes deciles and quartiles along with the median see his elementary manual of statistics 3rd edn 1920 p 160 62 he defines the maximum and minimum median quartiles and two deciles as the seven positions andrew ehrenberg articulated a philosophy of data reduction see his book of the same name the open university course statistics in society mdst 242 took the above ideas and merged them with gottfried noether s work which introduced statistical inference via coin tossing and the median test edit software r is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and
