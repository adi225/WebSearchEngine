public schools act of 1807 and they showed the government s willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster second the law involved the state in education an important first step in the creation of nondenominational schools the original two schools closed in 1846 by the mid 19th century the rial lost control of the other 82 grammar schools it had administered 19 its sole remaining purpose was to administer the mcgill bequests on behalf of the college mcgill college continued to grow now having the sole aim of providing post secondary education

1914 1918 this phot was taken at mcgill university in montreal in 1915 before the departure of the 2nd university company for france the company reinforced princess patricia s canadian light infantry on the somme in october 1915 mcgill university played a unique role in the great war many students and alumni of course enlisted in the first wave of patriotic fervor that swept the nation in 1914 mcgill s unique role emerged in the spring of 1915 after the first wave of heavy canadian casualties at ypres the canadian divisions had been badly mauled and six thousand reinforcements were needed every three months but princess patricia s canadian light infantry were not part of that reinforcement scheme as the first canadian regiment in action the patricia s had been serving as part of a british brigade although reinforcements trickled in to the patricia s the priority for canada was keeping the first division up to strength and getting a third division ready for deployment for the completer story of the regiment in the great war 44 faced with a desperate shortage of troops hamilton gault the founder of the regiment and a wealthy montreal businessman reached out to his friends at home for support in early 1915 the government had authorized the formation of a company at mcgill university for the 38th battalion being formed in ottawa with news of the devastating losses to the patricia s at frezenberg three prominent mcgill graduates george macdonald george currie and percival molson suggested that the university companies be used to reinforce the patricia s all were prominent and wealthy montreal businessmen molson was also well known as an athlete having completed in hockey football and track and field the first two companies had joined the new canadian officers training corps concentrating at niagara on the lake for training in short order they were on their way to france the first company joined the regiment at armentieres in late july and the second arrived little more than a month later fortunately the summer of 1915 was relatively quiet as those recovering from injury returned and the new arrivals were absorbed a very different regiment emerged in total 1300 men from five university companies joined the regiment between july 1915 and june 1916 the program initiated at mcgill reached out to other canadian universities and affiliated colleges across the country to attract recruits as a group they were younger better educated and more likely to be canadian born than the originals a full eighteen percent would ultimately become officers with most of those being commissioned from the ranks although over two hundred were commissioned from the ranks many more would serve as soldiers in the ranks throughout the war those historians who suggest that such reinforcement was a waste of talent show a profound lack of understanding about what is required for leadership in combat in an era when only 15 of males between 15 and 20 were in school attendance at university had more to do with family position than innate talent the training provided to those who were commissioned before joining their regiments was often sadly lacking most learned the essentials of leadership after they had joined their regiment in the field learning from those more experienced in how to survive trench warfare writing to his wife in september 1915 agar adamson described the new arrivals i find a great change in the regiment and the new n c o s of the two mcgill companies are sadly wanting in experience and in some cases may be a positive danger 45 by january 1916 after some time in the trenches given the regiment an opportunity to assess the leadership merits of the new arrivals the regiment was being asked to find a hundred ncos who might be commissioned to fill the needs of other regiments at vimy and passchendaele in 1917 men from the university companies were leading the attacking companies and mcdonald currie and molson had all been awarded the military cross for bravery in action on their return to canada after the war major george mcdonald and major george currie went on to for the accounting firm mcdonald currie that later
