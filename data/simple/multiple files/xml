cowan related standards xml schema domain data serialization abbreviation xml website xml 1 0 extensible markup language xml is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human readable and machine readable it is defined in the xml 1 0 specification 3 produced by the w3c and several other related specifications 4 all gratis open standards 5 the design goals of xml emphasize simplicity generality and usability over the internet 6 it is a textual data format with strong support via unicode for the languages of the world although the design of xml focuses on documents it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures for example in web services many application programming interfaces apis have been developed to aid software developers with processing xml data and several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of xml based languages as of 2009 update hundreds of xml based languages have been developed 7 including rss atom soap and xhtml xml based formats have become the default for many office productivity tools including microsoft office office open xml openoffice org and libreoffice opendocument

specification this is not an exhaustive list of all the constructs that appear in xml it provides an introduction to the key constructs most often encountered in day to day use unicode character by definition an xml document is a string of characters almost every legal unicode character may appear in an xml document processor and application the processor analyzes the markup and passes structured information to an application the specification places requirements on what an xml processor must do and not do but the application is outside its scope the processor as the specification calls it is often referred to colloquially as an xml parser markup and content the characters making up an xml document are divided into markup and content which may be distinguished by the application of simple syntactic rules generally strings that constitute markup either begin with the character lt and end with a gt or they begin with the character amp and end with a strings of characters that are not markup are content however in a cdata section the delimiters lt cdata and gt are classified as markup while the text between them is classified as content in addition whitespace before and after the outermost element is classified as markup tag a markup construct that begins with lt and ends with gt tags come in three flavors start tags for example lt section gt end tags for example lt section gt empty element tags for example lt line break 160 gt element a logical document component which either begins with a start tag and ends with a matching end tag or consists only of an empty element tag the characters between the start and end tags if any are the element s content and may contain markup including other elements which are called child elements an example of an element is lt greeting gt hello 160 world lt greeting gt see hello world another is lt line break 160 gt attribute a markup construct consisting of a name value pair that exists within a start tag or empty element tag in the example below the element img has two attributes src and alt lt img src madonna jpg alt foligno madonna by raphael gt another example would be lt step number 3 gt connect a to b lt step gt where the name of the attribute is number and the value is 3 xml declaration xml documents may begin by declaring some information about themselves as in the following example lt xml version 1 0 encoding utf 8 gt edit characters and escaping xml documents consist entirely of characters from the unicode repertoire except for a small number of specifically excluded control characters any character defined by unicode may appear within the content of an xml document xml includes facilities for identifying the encoding of the unicode characters that make up the document and for expressing characters that for one reason or another cannot be used directly edit valid characters main article valid characters in xml unicode code points in the following ranges are valid in xml 1 0 documents 8 u 0009 u 000a u 000d these are the only c0 controls accepted in xml 1 0 u 0020 u d7ff u e000 u fffd this excludes some not all non characters in the bmp all surrogates u fffe and u ffff are forbidden u 10000 u 10ffff this includes all code points in supplementary planes including non characters xml 1 1 9 extends the set of allowed characters to include all the above plus the remaining characters in the range u 0001 u 001f at the same time however it restricts the use of c0 and c1 control characters other than u 0009 u 000a u 000d and u 0085 by requiring them to be written in escaped form for example u 0001 must be written as amp x01 or its equivalent in the case of c1 characters this restriction is a backwards incompatibility it was introduced to allow common encoding errors to be detected the code point u 0000 is the only character that is not permitted in any xml 1 0 or 1 1 document edit encoding detection the unicode character set can be encoded into bytes for storage or transmission in a variety of different ways called encodings unicode itself defines encodings that cover the entire repertoire well known ones include utf 8 and utf 16 10 there are many other text encodings that predate unicode such as ascii and iso iec 8859 their character repertoires in almost every case are subsets of the unicode character set xml allows the use of any of the unicode defined encodings and any other encodings whose characters also appear in unicode xml also provides a mechanism whereby an xml processor can reliably without any prior knowledge determine which encoding is being used 11 encodings other than utf 8 and utf 16 will not necessarily be recognized by every xml parser edit escaping xml provides escape facilities for including characters which are problematic to include directly for example the characters lt and amp are key syntax markers and may never appear in content outside a cdata section 12 some character encodings support only a subset of unicode for example it is legal to encode an xml document in ascii but ascii lacks code points for unicode characters such as it might not be possible to type the character on the author s machine some characters have glyphs that cannot be visually distinguished from other characters examples are non breaking space amp xa0 160 compare space amp x20 cyrillic capital letter a amp x410 compare latin capital letter a amp x41 a there are five predefined entities amp lt represents lt amp gt represents gt amp amp represents amp amp apos represents amp quot represents all permitted unicode characters may be represented with a numeric character reference consider the chinese character whose numeric code in unicode is hexadecimal 4e2d or decimal 20 013 a user whose keyboard offers no method for entering this character could still insert it in an xml document encoded either as amp 20013 or amp x4e2d similarly the string i lt 3 j rg could be encoded for inclusion in an xml document as i amp lt 3 j amp xf6 rg amp 0 is not permitted however because the null character is one of the control characters excluded from xml even when using a numeric character reference 13 an alternative encoding mechanism such as base64 is needed to represent such characters edit comments comments may appear anywhere in a document outside other markup comments cannot appear before the xml declaration comments start with lt and end with gt the string double hyphen is not allowed inside comments this means comments cannot be nested the ampersand has no special significance within comments so entity and character references are not recognized as such and there is no way to represent characters outside the character set of the document encoding an example of a valid comment lt no need to escape lt code gt amp such in comments gt edit international use this example contains chinese text without proper rendering support you may see question marks boxes or other symbols instead of chinese characters this example contains cyrillic text without proper rendering support you may see question marks or boxes misplaced vowels or missing conjuncts instead of cyrillic letters xml 1 0 fifth edition and xml 1 1 support the direct use of almost any unicode character in element names attributes comments character data and processing instructions other than the ones that have special symbolic meaning in xml itself such as the less than sign lt the following is a well formed xml document including both chinese and cyrillic characters lt xml version 1 0 encoding utf 8 gt lt gt lt gt edit well formedness and error handling main article well formed document the xml specification defines an xml document as a well formed text meaning that it satisfies a list of syntax rules provided in the specification some key points in the fairly lengthy list include the document contains only properly encoded legal unicode characters none of the special syntax characters such as lt and amp appear except when performing their markup delineation roles the begin end and empty element tags that delimit the elements are correctly nested with none missing and none overlapping the element tags are case sensitive the beginning and end tags must match exactly tag names cannot contain any of the characters amp lt gt nor a space character and cannot start with or a numeric digit a single root element contains all the other elements the definition of an xml document excludes texts that contain violations of well formedness rules they are simply not xml an xml processor that encounters such a violation is required to report such errors and to cease normal processing this policy occasionally referred to by whom as draconian stands in notable contrast to the behavior of programs that process html which are designed by whom to produce a reasonable result even in the presence of severe markup errors 14 xml s policy in this area has been criticized as a violation of postel s law be conservative in what you send be liberal in what you accept 15 the xml specification defines a valid xml document as a well formed xml document which also conforms to the rules of a document type definition dtd by extension the term can also refer to documents that conform to rules in other schema languages such as xml schema xsd this term should not be confused with a well formed xml document which is defined as an xml document that has correct xml syntax according to w3c standards edit schemas and validation in addition to being well formed an xml document may be valid this means that it contains a reference to a document type definition dtd and that its elements and attributes are declared in that dtd and follow the grammatical rules for them that the dtd specifies xml processors are classified as validating or non validating depending on whether or not they check xml documents for validity a processor that discovers a validity error must be able to report it but may continue normal processing a dtd is an example of a schema or grammar since the initial publication of xml 1 0 there has been substantial work in the area of schema languages for xml such schema languages typically constrain the set of elements that may be used in a document which attributes may be applied to them the order in which they may appear and the allowable parent child relationships edit document type definition main article document type definition the oldest schema language for xml is the document type definition dtd inherited from sgml dtds have the following benefits dtd support is ubiquitous due to its inclusion in the xml 1 0 standard dtds are terse compared to element based schema languages and consequently present more information in a single screen dtds allow the declaration of standard public entity sets for publishing characters dtds define a document type rather than the types used by a namespace thus grouping all constraints for a document in a single collection dtds have the following limitations they have no explicit support for newer features of xml most importantly namespaces they lack expressiveness xml dtds are simpler than sgml dtds and there are certain structures that cannot be expressed with regular grammars dtds only support rudimentary datatypes they lack readability dtd designers typically make heavy use of parameter entities which behave essentially as textual macros which make it easier to define complex grammars but at the expense of clarity they use a syntax based on regular expression syntax inherited from sgml to describe the schema typical xml apis such as sax do not attempt to offer applications a structured representation of the syntax so it is less accessible to programmers than an element based syntax may be two peculiar features that distinguish dtds from other schema types are the syntactic support for embedding a dtd within xml documents and for defining entities which are arbitrary fragments of text and or markup that the xml processor inserts in the dtd itself and in the xml document wherever they are referenced like character escapes dtd technology is still used in many applications because of its ubiquity edit xml schema main article xml schema w3c a newer schema language described by the w3c as the successor of dtds is xml schema often referred to by the initialism for xml schema instances xsd xml schema definition xsds are far more powerful than dtds in describing xml languages they use a rich datatyping system and allow for more detailed constraints on an xml document s logical structure xsds also use an xml based format which makes it possible to use ordinary xml tools to help process them edit relax ng relax ng was initially specified by oasis and is now also an iso iec international standard as part of dsdl relax ng schemas may be written in either an xml based syntax or a more compact non xml syntax the two syntaxes are isomorphic and james clark s trang conversion tool can convert between them without loss of information relax ng has a simpler definition and validation framework than xml schema making it easier to use and implement it also has the ability to use datatype framework plug ins a relax ng schema author for example can require values in an xml document to conform to definitions in xml schema datatypes edit schematron schematron is a language for making assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in an xml document it typically uses xpath expressions edit iso dsdl and other schema languages the iso dsdl document schema description languages standard brings together a comprehensive set of small schema languages each targeted at specific problems dsdl includes relax ng full and compact syntax schematron assertion language and languages for defining datatypes character repertoire constraints renaming and entity expansion and namespace based routing of document fragments to different validators dsdl schema languages do not have the vendor support of xml schemas yet and are to some extent a grassroots reaction of industrial publishers to the lack of utility of xml schemas for publishing some schema languages not only describe the structure of a particular xml format but also offer limited facilities to influence processing of individual xml files that conform to this format dtds and xsds both have this ability they can for instance provide the infoset augmentation facility and attribute defaults relax ng and schematron intentionally do not provide these edit related specifications a cluster of specifications closely related to xml have been developed starting soon after the initial publication of xml 1 0 it is frequently the case that the term xml is used to refer to xml together with one or more of these other technologies which have come to be seen as part of the xml core xml namespaces enable the same document to contain xml elements and attributes taken from different vocabularies without any naming collisions occurring although xml namespaces are not part of the xml specification itself virtually all xml software also supports xml namespaces xml base defines the xml base attribute which may be used to set the base for resolution of relative uri references within the scope of a single xml element the xml information set or xml infoset describes an abstract data model for xml documents in terms of information items the infoset is commonly used in the specifications of xml languages for convenience in describing constraints on the xml constructs those languages allow xml id version 1 0 asserts that an attribute named xml id functions as an id attribute in the sense used in a dtd xpath defines a syntax named xpath expressions which identifies one or more of the internal components elements attributes and so on included in an xml document xpath is widely used in other core xml specifications and in programming libraries for accessing xml encoded data xslt is a language with an xml based syntax that is used to transform xml documents into other xml documents html or other unstructured formats such as plain text or rtf xslt is very tightly coupled with xpath which it uses to address components of the input xml document mainly elements and attributes xsl formatting objects or xsl fo is a markup language for xml document formatting which is most often used to generate pdfs xquery is an xml oriented query language strongly rooted in xpath and xml schema it provides methods to access manipulate and return xml and is mainly conceived as a query language for xml databases xml signature defines syntax and processing rules for creating digital signatures on xml content xml encryption defines syntax and processing rules for encrypting xml content some other specifications conceived as part of the xml core have failed to find wide adoption including xinclude xlink and xpointer edit use on the internet xml has come into common use for the interchange of data over the internet rfc 3023 gives rules for the construction of internet media types for use when sending xml it also defines the media types application xml and text xml which say only that the data are in xml and nothing about its semantics the use of text xml has been criticized as a potential source of encoding problems and it has been suggested that it should be deprecated 16 rfc 3023 also recommends that xml based languages be given media types ending in xml for example image svg xml for svg further guidelines for the use of xml in a networked context may be found in rfc 3470 also known as ietf bcp 70 this document is very wide ranging and covers many aspects of designing and deploying an xml based language edit programming interfaces the design goals of xml include it shall be easy to write programs which process xml documents 6 despite this the xml specification contains almost no information about how programmers might go about doing such processing the xml infoset specification provides a vocabulary to refer to the constructs within an xml document but also does not provide any guidance on how to access this information a variety of apis for accessing xml have been developed and used and some have been standardized existing apis for xml processing tend to fall into these categories stream oriented apis accessible from a programming language for example sax and stax tree traversal apis accessible from a programming language for example dom xml data binding which provides an automated translation between an xml document and programming language objects declarative transformation languages such as xslt and xquery stream oriented facilities require less memory and for certain tasks which are based on a linear traversal of an xml document are faster and simpler than other alternatives tree traversal and data binding apis typically require the use of much more memory but are often found more convenient for use by programmers some include declarative retrieval of document components via the use of xpath expressions xslt is designed for declarative description of xml document transformations and has been widely implemented both in server side packages and web browsers xquery overlaps xslt in its functionality but is designed more for searching of large xml databases edit simple api for xml simple api for xml sax is a lexical event driven interface in which a document is read serially and its contents are reported as callbacks to various methods on a handler object of the user s design sax is fast and efficient to implement but difficult to use for extracting information at random from the xml since it tends to burden the application author with keeping track of what part of the document is being processed it is better suited to situations in which certain types of information are always handled the same way no matter where they occur in the document edit pull parsing pull parsing 17 treats the document as a series of items which are read in sequence using the iterator design pattern this allows for writing of recursive descent parsers in which the structure of the code performing the parsing mirrors the structure of the xml being parsed and intermediate parsed results can be used and accessed as local variables within the methods performing the parsing or passed down as method parameters into lower level methods or returned as method return values to higher level methods examples of pull parsers include stax in the java programming language xmlreader in php system xml xmlreader in the net framework and the dom traversal api nodeiterator and treewalker a pull parser creates an iterator that sequentially visits the various elements attributes and data in an xml document code which uses this iterator can test the current item to tell for example whether it is a start or end element or text and inspect its attributes local name namespace values of xml attributes value of text etc and can also move the iterator to the next item the code can thus extract information from the document as it traverses it the recursive descent approach tends to lend itself to keeping data as typed local variables in the code doing the parsing while sax for instance typically requires a parser to manually maintain intermediate data within a stack of elements which are parent elements of the element being parsed pull parsing code can be more straightforward to understand and maintain than sax parsing code edit document object model the document object model dom is an interface oriented application programming interface that allows for navigation of the entire document as if it were a tree of node objects representing the document s contents a dom document can be created by a parser or can be generated manually by users with limitations data types in dom nodes are abstract implementations provide their own programming language specific bindings dom implementations tend to be memory intensive as they generally require the entire document to be loaded into memory and constructed as a tree of objects before access is allowed edit data binding another form of xml processing api is xml data binding where xml data are made available as a hierarchy of custom strongly typed classes in contrast to the generic objects created by a document object model parser this approach simplifies code development and in many cases allows problems to be identified at compile time rather than run time example data binding systems include the java architecture for xml binding jaxb and xml serialization in net 18 edit xml as data type xml has appeared as a first class data type in other languages the ecmascript for xml e4x extension to the ecmascript javascript language explicitly defines two specific objects xml and xmllist for javascript which support xml document nodes and xml node lists as distinct objects and use a dot notation specifying parent child relationships 19 e4x is supported by the mozilla 2 5 browsers though now deprecated and adobe actionscript but has not been adopted more universally similar notations are used in microsoft s linq implementation for microsoft net 3 5 and above and in scala which uses the java vm the open source xmlsh application which provides a linux like shell with special features for xml manipulation similarly treats xml as a data type using the lt gt notation 20 the resource description framework defines a data type rdf xmlliteral to hold wrapped canonical xml 21 edit history xml is an application profile of sgml iso 8879 22 the versatility of sgml for dynamic information display was understood by early digital media publishers in the late 1980s prior to the rise of the internet 23 24 by the mid 1990s some practitioners of sgml had gained experience with the then new world wide web and believed that sgml offered solutions to some of the problems the web was likely to face as it grew dan connolly added sgml to the list of w3c s activities when he joined the staff in 1995 work began in mid 1996 when sun microsystems engineer jon bosak developed a charter and recruited collaborators bosak was well connected in the small community of people who had experience both in sgml and the web 25 xml was compiled by a working group of eleven members 26 supported by a roughly 150 member interest group technical debate took place on the interest group mailing list and issues were resolved by consensus or when that failed majority vote of the working group a record of design decisions and their rationales was compiled by michael sperberg mcqueen on december 4 1997 27 james clark served as technical lead of the working group notably contributing the empty element lt empty 160 gt syntax and the name xml other names that had been put forward for consideration included magma minimal architecture for generalized markup applications slim structured language for internet markup and mgml minimal generalized markup language the co editors of the specification were originally tim bray and michael sperberg mcqueen halfway through the project bray accepted a consulting engagement with netscape provoking vociferous protests from microsoft bray was temporarily asked to resign the editorship this led to intense dispute in the working group eventually solved by the appointment of microsoft s jean paoli as a third co editor the xml working group never met face to face the design was accomplished using a combination of email and weekly teleconferences the major design decisions were reached in a short burst of intense work between august and november 1996 28 when the first working draft of an xml specification was published 29 further design work continued through 1997 and xml 1 0 became a w3c recommendation on february 10 1998 edit sources xml is a profile of an iso standard sgml and most of xml comes from sgml unchanged from sgml comes the separation of logical and physical structures elements and entities the availability of grammar based validation dtds the separation of data and metadata elements and attributes mixed content the separation of processing from representation processing instructions and the default angle bracket syntax removed were the sgml declaration xml has a fixed delimiter set and adopts unicode as the document character set other sources of technology for xml were the text encoding initiative tei which defined a profile of sgml for use as a transfer syntax and html in which elements were synchronous with their resource document character sets were separate from resource encoding the xml lang attribute was invented and like http metadata accompanied the resource rather than being needed at the declaration of a link the extended reference concrete syntax ercs project of the spread standardization project regarding east asian documents project of the iso related china japan korea document processing expert group was the basis of xml 1 0 s naming rules spread also introduced hexadecimal numeric character references and the concept of references to make available all unicode characters to support ercs xml and html better the sgml standard is 8879 was revised in 1996 and 1998 with websgml adaptations the xml header followed that of iso hytime ideas that developed during discussion which were novel in xml included the algorithm for encoding detection and the encoding header the processing instruction target the xml space attribute and the new close delimiter for empty element tags the notion of well formedness as opposed to validity which enables parsing without a schema was first formalized in xml although it had been implemented successfully in the electronic book technology dynatext software 30 the software from the university of waterloo new oxford english dictionary project the risp lisp sgml text processor at uniscope tokyo the us army missile command iads hypertext system mentor graphics context interleaf and xerox publishing system edit versions there are two current versions of xml the first xml 1 0 was initially defined in 1998 it has undergone minor revisions since then without being given a new version number and is currently in its fifth edition as published on november 26 2008 it is widely implemented and still recommended for general use the second xml 1 1 was initially published on february 4 2004 the same day as xml 1 0 third edition 31 and is currently in its second edition as published on august 16 2006 it contains features some contentious that are intended to make xml easier to use in certain cases 32 the main changes are to enable the use of line ending characters used on ebcdic platforms and the use of scripts and characters absent from unicode 3 2 xml 1 1 is not very widely implemented and is recommended for use only by those who need its unique features 33 prior to its fifth edition release xml 1 0 differed from xml 1 1 in having stricter requirements for characters available for use in element and attribute names and unique identifiers in the first four editions of xml 1 0 the characters were exclusively enumerated using a specific version of the unicode standard unicode 2 0 to unicode 3 2 the fifth edition substitutes the mechanism of xml 1 1 which is more future proof but reduces redundancy the approach taken in the fifth edition of xml 1 0 and in all editions of xml 1 1 is that only certain characters are forbidden in names and everything else is allowed in order to accommodate the use of suitable name characters in future versions of unicode in the fifth edition xml names may contain characters in the balinese cham or phoenician scripts among many others which have been added to unicode since unicode 3 2 32 almost any unicode code point can be used in the character data and attribute values of an xml 1 0 or 1 1 document even if the character corresponding to the code point is not defined in the current version of unicode in character data and attribute values xml 1 1 allows the use of more control characters than xml 1 0 but for robustness most of the control characters introduced in xml 1 1 must be expressed as numeric character references and x7f through x9f which had been allowed in xml 1 0 are in xml 1 1 even required to be expressed as numeric character references 34 among the supported control characters in xml 1 1 are two line break codes that must be treated as whitespace whitespace characters are the only control codes that can be written directly there has been discussion of an xml 2 0 although no organization has announced plans for work on such a project xml sw sw for skunkworks written by one of the original developers of xml 35 contains some proposals for what an xml 2 0 might look like elimination of dtds from syntax integration of namespaces xml base and xml information set infoset into the base standard the world wide web consortium also has an xml binary characterization working group doing preliminary research into use cases and properties for a binary encoding of the xml infoset the working group is not chartered to produce any official standards since xml is by definition text based itu t and iso are using the name fast infoset for their own binary infoset to avoid confusion see itu t rec x 891 iso iec 24824 1 edit criticism xml and its extensions have regularly been criticized for verbosity and complexity 36 mapping the basic tree model of xml to type systems of programming languages or databases can be difficult especially when xml is used for exchanging highly structured data between applications which was not its primary design goal other criticisms attempt to refute the claim that xml is a self describing language 37 though the xml specification itself makes no such claim json yaml and s expressions are frequently proposed as alternatives see comparison of data serialization formats 38 which focus on representing
