in temperature air pressure moisture and wind direction usually temperature pressure wind measurements and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer barometer anemometer and hygrometer respectively there are many methods of collecting data and radar lidar satellites are some of them weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere the main issue arise in this prediction is it involves high dimensional characters to overcome this issue it is necessary to first analyze and simplify the data before proceeding with other analysis some data mining techniques are appropriate in this context contents 1 what is data mining 1 1 self organizing maps 2 references 3 external links edit what is data mining data mining the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases is a powerful new technology with great potential to analyze important information in data warehouses consequently data mining consists of more than collecting and analyzing data it also includes analyze and predictions the tools which are used for analysis can include statistical models mathematical algorithms and machine learning methods these methods include algorithms that improve their performance automatically through experience such as neural networks or decision trees 1 the network architecture and signal process used to model nervous systems can roughly be divided into three categories each based on a different philosophy feedforward neural network the input information defines the initial signals into set of output signals 2 feedback network the input information defines the initial activity state of a feedback system and after state transitions the asymptotic final state is identified as the outcome of the computation 3 neighboring cells in a neural network compete in their activities by means of mutual lateral interactions and develop adaptively into specific detectors of different signal patterns in this category learning is called competitive unsupervised learning or self organizing 4 edit self organizing maps self organizing map som is one of the most popular neural network models which is especially suitable for high dimensional data visualization clustering and modeling it uses an unsupervised learning for creating a set of prototype vectors representing the data the som was introduced to meteorological and climatic sciences in late 1990s as a clustering and pattern recognition method 5 nowadays self organized maps have been applied in several meteorological problems such as classifying climate modes cloud classification 6 classification of temp data 7 extreme weather and rainfall pattern analysis the self organizing map projects high dimensional input data onto a low dimensional usually two dimensional space 8 because it preserves the neighborhood relations of the input data the som is a topology preserving technique there are many types of topologies used in som grid hexagonal random are some of them 9 the output neurons are arranged according to the given topology the distances between neurons are calculated using a distance function 10 there are several distance functions which can be used such as euclidean distance box distance link distance and manhattan distance according to the first input of the input vector system chooses the output neuron winning neuron that closely matches with the given input vector then determining a neighborhood of excited neurons around the winner and finally updating all of the excited neurons it must select the neighborhood function that permits to calculate the nodes nearest to the winner 11 some neighborhood functions are the gaussian the bubble and the ep 12 the outcome weight vectors of the som nodes are reshaped back to have characteristic data patterns this learning procedure leads to a topologically ordered mapping of the input data similar patterns are mapped onto neighboring regions on the map while dissimilar patterns are located further apart edit references seifert w 2004 data mining an overview crs kohonen t 2002 the self organizing map ieee pp 160 1464 1480 kohonen t 2002 the self
