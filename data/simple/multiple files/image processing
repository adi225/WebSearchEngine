confused with visual processing see also digital image processing monochrome black white image in imaging science image processing is any form of signal processing for which the input is an image such as a photograph or video frame the output of image processing may be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image most image processing techniques involve treating the image as a two dimensional signal and applying standard signal processing techniques to it image processing usually refers to digital image processing but optical and analog image processing also are possible this article is about general techniques that apply to all of them the acquisition of images producing the input image in the first place is referred to as imaging image processing image processing is referred to processing of a 2d picture by a computer basic definitions an image defined in the real world is considered to be a function of two real variables for example a x y with a as the amplitude e g brightness of the image at the real coordinate position x y modern digital technology has made it possible to manipulate multi dimensional signals with systems that range from simple digital circuits to advanced parallel computers the goal of this manipulation can be divided into three categories image processing image in gt image out image analysis image in gt measurements out image understanding image in gt high level description out an image may be considered to contain sub images sometimes referred to as regions of interest rois or simply regions this concept reflects the fact that images frequently contain collections of objects each of which can be the basis for a region in a sophisticated image processing system it should be possible to apply specific image processing operations to selected regions thus one part of an image region might be processed to suppress motion blur while another part might be processed to improve color rendition sequence of image processing the most requirements for image processing of images is that the images be available in digitized form that is arrays of finite length binary words for digitization the given image is sampled on a discrete grid and each sample or pixel is quantized using a finite number of bits the digitized image is processed by a computer to display a digital image it is first converted into analog signal which is scanned onto a display closely related to image processing are computer graphics and computer vision in computer graphics images are manually made from physical models of objects environments and lighting instead of being acquired via imaging devices such as cameras from natural scenes as in most animated movies computer vision on the other hand is often considered high level image processing out of which a machine computer software intends to decipher the physical contents of an image or a sequence of images e g videos or 3d full body magnetic resonance scans in modern sciences and technologies images also gain much broader scopes due to the ever growing importance of scientific visualization of often large scale complex scientific experimental data examples include microarray data in genetic research or real time multi asset portfolio trading in finance before going to processing an image it is converted into a digital form digitization includes sampling of image and quantization of sampled values after converting the image into bit information processing is performed this processing technique may be image enhancement image reconstruction and image compression image enhancement it refers to accentuation or sharpening of image features such as boundaries or contrast to make a graphic display more useful for display amp analysis this process does not increase the inherent information content in data it includes gray level amp contrast manipulation noise reduction edge crispening and sharpening filtering interpolation and magnification pseudo coloring and so on image restoration it is concerned with filtering the observed image to minimize the effect of degradations effectiveness of image restoration depends on the extent and accuracy of the knowledge of degradation process as well as on filter design image restoration differs from image enhancement in that the latter is concerned with more extraction or accentuation of image features image compression it is concerned with minimizing the no of bits required to represent an image application of compression are in broadcast tv remote sensing via satellite military communication via aircraft radar teleconferencing facsimile transmission for educational amp business documents medical images that arise in computer tomography magnetic resonance imaging and digital
