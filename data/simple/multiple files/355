is about the construction and study of systems that can learn from data for example a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non spam messages after learning it can then be used to classify new email messages into spam and non spam folders the core of machine learning deals with representation and generalization representation of data instances and functions evaluated on these instances are part of all machine learning systems for example in the above email message example we can represent an email as a set of english words by simply discarding the word order generalization is the property that the system will perform well on unseen data instances the conditions under which this can be guaranteed are a key object of study in the subfield of computational learning theory there is a wide variety of machine learning tasks and successful applications optical character recognition in which printed characters are recognized automatically based on previous examples is a classic engineering example of machine learning 1 contents 1 definition 2 generalization 3 machine learning knowledge discovery in databases kdd and data

that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed 2 tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e 3 this definition is notable for its defining machine learning in fundamentally operational rather than cognitive terms thus following alan turing s proposal in turing s paper computing machinery and intelligence that the question can machines think be replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do 4 edit generalization generalization in this context is the ability of an algorithm to perform accurately on new unseen examples after having trained on a learning data set the core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience 5 the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution and the learner has to extract from them something more general something about that distribution that allows it to produce useful predictions in new cases edit machine learning knowledge discovery in databases kdd and data mining two terms are commonly confused as they often employ the same methods and overlap significantly they can be roughly defined as follows machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining which is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties on the data the two areas overlap in many ways data mining uses many machine learning methods but often with a slightly different goal in mind on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data edit human interaction some machine learning systems attempt to eliminate the need for human intuition in data analysis while others adopt a collaborative approach between human and machine human intuition cannot however be entirely eliminated since the system s designer must specify how the data is to be represented and what mechanisms will be used to search for a characterization of the data edit algorithm types machine learning algorithms can be organized into a taxonomy based on the desired outcome of the algorithm or the type of input available during training the machine citation needed supervised learning generates a function that maps inputs to desired outputs also called labels because they are often provided by human experts labeling the training examples for example in a classification problem the learner approximates a function mapping a vector into classes by looking at input output examples of the function unsupervised learning models a set of inputs like clustering see also data mining and knowledge discovery here labels are not known during training semi supervised learning combines both labeled and unlabeled examples to generate an appropriate function or classifier transduction or transductive inference tries to predict new outputs on specific and fixed test cases from observed specific training cases reinforcement learning learns how to act given an observation of the world every action has some impact in the environment and the environment provides feedback in the form of rewards that guides the learning algorithm learning to learn learns its own inductive bias based on previous experience edit theory main article computational learning theory the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common in addition to performance bounds computational learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time there are many similarities between machine learning theory and statistics although they use different terms edit approaches main article list of machine learning algorithms edit decision tree learning main article decision tree learning decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model which maps observations about an item to conclusions about the item s target value edit association rule learning main article association rule learning association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases edit artificial neural networks main article artificial neural network an artificial neural network ann learning algorithm usually called neural network nn is a learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and functional aspects of biological neural networks computations are structured in terms of an interconnected group of artificial neurons processing information using a connectionist approach to computation modern neural networks are non linear statistical data modeling tools they are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs to find patterns in data or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution between observed variables edit genetic programming main articles genetic programming and evolutionary computation genetic programming gp is an evolutionary algorithm based methodology inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that perform a user defined task it is a specialization of genetic algorithms ga where each individual is a computer program it is a machine learning technique used to optimize a population of computer programs according to a fitness landscape determined by a program s ability to perform a given computational task edit inductive logic programming main article inductive logic programming inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program which entails all the positive and none of the negative examples edit support vector machines main article support vector machines support vector machines svms are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other edit clustering main article cluster analysis cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness similarity between members of the same cluster and separation between different clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and a common technique for statistical data analysis edit bayesian networks main article bayesian network a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning edit reinforcement learning main article reinforcement learning reinforcement learning is concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of long term reward reinforcement learning algorithms attempt to find a policy that maps states of the world to the actions the agent ought to take in those states reinforcement learning differs from the supervised learning problem in that correct input output pairs are never presented nor sub optimal actions explicitly corrected edit representation learning several learning algorithms mostly unsupervised learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training classical examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a pre processing step before performing classification or predictions allowing to reconstruct the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution while not being necessarily faithful for configurations that are implausible under that distribution manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low dimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into high dimensional vectors 6 deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higher level more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lower level features it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data 7 edit similarity and metric learning main article similarity learning in this problem the learning machine is given pairs of examples that are considered similar and pairs of less similar objects it then needs to learn a similarity function or a distance metric function that can predict if new objects are similar it is sometimes used in recommendation systems edit sparse dictionary learning in this method a datum is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and the coefficients are assumed to be sparse let x be a d dimensional datum d be a n by d matrix where each column of d represents a basis function r is the coefficient to represent x using d mathematically sparse dictionary learning means the following where r is sparse generally speaking n is assumed to be larger than d to allow the freedom for a sparse representation sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine which classes a previously unseen datum belongs to suppose a dictionary for each class has already been built then a new datum is associated with the class such that it s best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de noising the key idea is that a clean image path can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot 8 edit applications applications for machine learning include machine perception computer vision natural language processing syntactic
