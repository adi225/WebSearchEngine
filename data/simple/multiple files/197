for concept of expenditure of energy see power physics electric power is transmitted on overhead lines like these and also on underground high voltage cables electric energy cable damaging the concrete electric power is the rate at which electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit the si unit of power is the watt one joule per second electric power is usually produced by electric generators but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry contents 1 definition 2

wattage is used colloquially to mean electric power in watts the electric power in watts produced by an electric current i consisting of a charge of q coulombs every t seconds passing through an electric potential voltage difference of v is where q is electric charge in coulombs t is time in seconds i is electric current in amperes v is electric potential or voltage in volts edit explanation electric power is transformed to other forms of power when electric charges move through an electric potential voltage difference when an electric charge moves through a potential difference from a high voltage to a low voltage the potential does work on the charges converting the energy in the potential to kinetic energy of the charges or some other form this occurs in most electrical appliances such as light bulbs electric motors and heaters they consume electric power converting it to mechanical work heat light etc if the charges are forced to move by an outside force in the direction from a lower potential to a higher power is transferred to the electric current this occurs in sources of electric current such as electric generators and batteries edit passive sign convention in electronics which deals with more passive than active devices electric power consumed in a device is defined to have a positive sign while power produced by a device is defined to have a negative sign this is called the passive sign convention edit resistive circuits in the case of resistive ohmic or linear loads joule s law can be combined with ohm s law v i r to produce alternative expressions for the dissipated power where r is the electrical resistance edit alternating current main article ac power in alternating current circuits energy storage elements such as inductance and capacitance may result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow the portion of power flow that averaged over a complete cycle of the ac waveform results in net transfer of energy in one direction is known as real power also referred to as active power that portion of power flow due to stored energy that returns to the source in each cycle is known as reactive power power triangle the components of ac power the relationship between real power reactive power and apparent power can be expressed by representing the quantities as vectors real power is represented as a horizontal vector and reactive power is represented as a vertical vector the apparent power vector is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by connecting the real and reactive power vectors this representation is often called the power triangle using the pythagorean theorem the relationship among real reactive and apparent power is real and reactive powers can also be calculated directly from the apparent power when the current and voltage are both sinusoids with a known phase angle between them the ratio of real power to apparent power is called power factor and is a number always between 0 and 1 where the currents and voltages have non sinusoidal forms power factor is generalized to include the effects of distortion edit electromagnetic fields this section does not cite any references or

fields exist together and fluctuate in the same place the simplest example of this is in electrical circuits as the preceding section showed in the general case however the simple equation p iv must be replaced by a more complex calculation the integral of the cross product of the electrical and magnetic field vectors over a specified area thus the result is a scalar since it is the surface integral of the poynting vector edit electric power supply main article power supply edit electricity generation main article electricity generation the fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered during the 1820s and early 1830s by the british scientist michael faraday his basic method is still used today electricity is generated by the movement of a loop of wire or disc of copper between the poles of a magnet 1 for electric utilities it is the first process in the delivery of electricity to consumers the other processes electricity transmission distribution and electrical power storage and recovery using pumped storage methods are normally carried out by the electric power industry electricity is most often generated at a power station by electromechanical generators primarily driven by heat engines fueled by chemical combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind there are many other technologies that can be and are used to generate electricity such as solar photovoltaics and geothermal power edit battery power main article battery electricity a battery is a device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells that convert stored chemical energy into electrical energy 2 since the invention of the first battery or voltaic pile in 1800 by alessandro volta and especially since the technically improved daniell cell in 1836 batteries have become a common power source for many household and industrial applications according to a 2005 estimate the worldwide battery industry generates us 48 billion in sales each year 3 with 6 annual growth 4 there are two types of batteries primary batteries disposable batteries which are designed to be used once and discarded and secondary batteries rechargeable batteries which are designed to be recharged and used multiple times batteries come in many sizes from miniature cells used to power hearing aids and wristwatches to battery banks the size of rooms that provide standby power for telephone exchanges and computer data centers edit electric power industry main article electric power industry the electric power industry provides the production and delivery of power in sufficient quantities to areas that need electricity through a grid connection the grid distributes electrical energy to customers electric power is generated by central power stations or by distributed generation many households and businesses need access to electricity especially in developed nations the demand being scarcer in developing nations demand for electricity is derived from the requirement for electricity in order to operate domestic appliances office equipment industrial machinery and provide sufficient energy for both domestic and commercial lighting heating cooking and industrial processes because of this aspect of the industry it is viewed as a public utility as infrastructure edit see also energy portal
