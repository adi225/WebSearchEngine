in data warehousing a fact table consists of the measurements metrics or facts of a business process it is located at the center of a star schema or a snowflake schema surrounded by dimension tables where multiple fact tables are used these are arranged as a fact constellation schema a fact table typically has two types of columns those that contain facts and those that are foreign keys to dimension tables the primary key of a fact table is usually a composite key that is made up of all of its foreign keys fact tables contain the content of the data warehouse and store different types of measures like additive non additive and semi additive measures fact tables provide the usually additive values that act as independent variables by which dimensional attributes are analyzed fact tables are often defined by their grain the grain of a fact table represents the most atomic level by which the facts may be defined the grain of a sales fact table might be stated as sales volume by day by product by store each record in this fact table is therefore uniquely defined by a day product and store other dimensions might be members of this fact table such as location region but these add nothing to the uniqueness of the fact records these affiliate dimensions allow for additional slices of the independent facts but generally provide insights at a higher level of aggregation a region contains many stores contents 1 example 2 measure types 3 types of fact tables 4 steps in designing a fact table 5 references edit example if the business process is sales then the corresponding fact table will typically contain columns representing both raw facts and aggregations in rows such as 12 000 being sales for new york store for 15 jan 2005 34 000 being sales for los angeles store for 15 jan 2005 22 000 being sales for new york store for 16 jan 2005 50 000 being sales for los angeles store for 16 jan 2005 21 000 being average daily sales for los angeles store for jan 2005 65 000 being average daily sales for los angeles store for feb 2005 33 000 being average daily sales for los angeles store for year 2005 average daily sales is a measurement which is stored in the fact table the fact table also contains foreign keys from the dimension tables where time series e g dates and other dimensions e g store location salesperson product are stored all foreign keys between fact and dimension tables should be surrogate keys not reused keys from operational data edit measure types additive measures that can be added across any dimensions non additive measures that cannot be added across any dimension semi additive measures that can be added across some dimensions a fact table might contain either detail level facts or facts that have been aggregated fact tables that contain aggregated facts are often instead called summary tables special care must be taken when handling ratios and percentage one good design rule 1 is to never store percentages or ratios in fact tables but only calculate these in the data access tool thus only store the numerator and denominator in the fact table which then can be aggregated and the aggregated stored values can then be used for calculating the ratio or percentage in the data access tool in the real world it is possible to have a fact table that contains no measures or facts these tables are called factless fact tables or junction tables the factless fact tables can for example be used for modeling many to many relationships or capture events 1 edit types of fact tables there are basically three fundamental measurement events which characterizes all fact tables 2 transactional a transactional table is the most basic and fundamental the grain associated with a transactional fact table is usually specified as one row per line in a transaction e g every line on a receipt typically a transactional fact table holds data of the most detailed level causing it to have a great number of dimensions associated with it periodic snapshots the periodic snapshot as the name implies takes a picture of the moment where the moment could be any defined period of time e g a performance summary of a salesman over the previous month a periodic snapshot table is dependent on the transactional table as it needs the detailed data held in the transactional fact table in order to deliver the chosen performance output accumulating snapshots this type of fact table is used to show the activity of a process that has a well defined beginning and end e g the processing of an order an order moves through specific steps until it is fully processed as steps towards fulfilling the order are completed the associated row in the fact table is updated an accumulating snapshot table often has multiple date columns each representing a milestone in the process therefore it s important to have an entry in the associated date dimension that represents an unknown date as many of the milestone dates are unknown at the time of the creation of the row edit steps in designing a fact table identify a business process for analysis like sales identify measures or facts sales dollar by asking questions like what number of xx are relevant for the business process replacing the xx with various options that make sense within the context of the business identify dimensions for facts product dimension location dimension time dimension organization dimension by asking questions that make sense within the context of the business like analyse by xx where xx is replaced with the subject to test list the columns that describe each dimension region name branch name business unit name determine the lowest level granularity of summary in a fact table e g sales dollars an alternative approach is the four step design process described in kimball 1 edit references a b c kimball amp ross the data warehouse toolkit 2nd ed wiley 2002 kimball ralph 2008 the data warehouse lifecycle
