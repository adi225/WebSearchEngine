the largest sem vendors were google adwords yahoo search marketing and microsoft adcenter 1 as of 2006 sem was growing much faster than traditional advertising and even other channels of online marketing 3 because of the complex technology a secondary search marketing agency market has evolved some marketers have difficulty understanding the intricacies of search engine marketing and choose to rely on third party agencies to manage their search marketing edit history as the number of sites on the web increased in the mid to late 90s search engines started appearing to help people find information quickly search engines developed business models to finance their services such as pay per click programs offered by open text 4 in 1996 and then goto com 5 in 1998 goto com later changed its name 6 to overture in 2001 and was purchased by yahoo in 2003 and now offers paid search opportunities for advertisers through yahoo search marketing google also began to offer advertisements on search results pages in 2000 through the google adwords program by 2007 pay per click programs proved to be primary money makers 7 for search engines in a market dominated by google in 2009 yahoo and microsoft announced the intention to forge an alliance the yahoo amp microsoft search alliance eventually received approval from regulators in the us and europe in february 2010 8 search engine optimization consultants expanded their offerings to help businesses learn about and use the advertising opportunities offered by search engines and new agencies focusing primarily upon marketing and advertising through search engines emerged the term search engine marketing was proposed by danny sullivan in 2001 9 to cover the spectrum of activities involved in performing seo managing paid listings at the search engines submitting sites to directories and developing online marketing strategies for businesses organizations and individuals edit methods and metrics there are four categories of methods and metrics used to optimize websites through search engine marketing 10 11 12 keyword research and analysis involves three steps ensuring the site can be indexed in the search engines finding the most relevant and popular keywords for the site and its products and using those keywords on the site in a way that will generate and convert traffic website saturation and popularity how much presence a website has on search engines can be analyzed through the number of pages of the site that are indexed on search engines saturation and how many backlinks the site has popularity it requires pages to contain keywords people are looking for and ensure that they rank high enough in search engine rankings most search engines include some form of link popularity in their ranking algorithms the followings are major tools measuring various aspects of saturation and link popularity link popularity top 10 google analysis and marketleap s link popularity and search engine saturation 11 back end tools including web analytic tools and html validators provide data on a website and its visitors and allow the success of a website to be measured they range from simple traffic counters to tools that work with log files 10 and to more sophisticated tools that are based on page tagging putting javascript or an image on a page to track actions these tools can deliver conversion related information there are three major tools used by ebsco a log file analyzing tool webtrends by netiq b tag based analytic programs websidestory s hitbox c transaction based tool tealeaf realitea validators check the invisible parts of websites highlighting potential problems and many usability issues ensure websites meets w3c code standards try to use more than one html validator or spider simulator because each tests highlights and reports on slightly different aspects of your website whois tools reveal the owners of various websites and can provide valuable information relating to copyright and trademark issues 12 edit paid inclusion paid inclusion involves a search engine company charging fees for the inclusion of a website in their results pages also known as sponsored listings paid inclusion products are provided by most search engine companies the most notable being google the fee structure is both a filter against superfluous submissions and a revenue generator typically the fee covers an annual subscription for one webpage which will automatically be catalogued on a regular basis however some companies are experimenting with non subscription based fee structures where purchased listings are displayed permanently a per click fee may also apply each search engine is different some sites allow only paid inclusion although these have had little success more frequently many search engines like yahoo 13 mix paid inclusion per page and per click fee with results from web crawling others like google and as of 2006 ask com 14 15 do not let webmasters pay to be in their search engine listing advertisements are shown separately and labeled as such some detractors of paid inclusion allege that it causes searches to return results based more on the economic standing of the interests of a web site and less on the relevancy of that site to end users often the line between pay per click advertising and paid inclusion is debatable some have lobbied for any paid listings to be labeled as an advertisement while defenders insist they are not actually ads since the webmasters do not control the content of the listing its ranking or even whether it is shown to any users another advantage of paid inclusion is that it allows site owners to specify particular schedules for crawling pages in the general case one has no control as to when their page will be crawled or added to a search engine index paid inclusion proves to be particularly useful for cases where pages are dynamically generated and frequently modified paid inclusion is a search engine marketing method in itself but also a tool of search engine optimization since experts and firms can test out different approaches to improving ranking and see the results often within a couple of days instead of waiting weeks or months knowledge gained this way can be used to optimize other web pages without paying the search engine company edit comparison with seo sem is the wider discipline that incorporates seo sem includes both paid search results using tools like google adwords or bing ads formerly known as microsoft adcenter and organic search results seo sem uses paid advertising with adwords or bing ads pay per click particularly beneficial for local providers as it enables potential consumers to contact a company directly with one click article submissions advertising and making sure seo has been done a keyword analysis is performed for both seo and sem but not necessarily at the same time sem and seo both need to be monitored and updated frequently to reflect evolving best practices in some contexts the term sem is used exclusively to mean pay per click advertising 2 particularly in the commercial advertising and marketing communities which have a vested interest in this narrow definition such usage excludes the wider search marketing community that is engaged in other forms of sem such as search engine optimization and search retargeting another part of sem is social media marketing smm smm is a type of marketing that involves exploiting social media to influence consumers that one company s products and or services are valuable 16 some of the latest theoretical advances include search engine marketing management semm semm relates to activities including seo but focuses on return on investment roi management instead of relevant traffic building as is the case of mainstream seo semm also integrates organic seo trying to achieve top ranking without using paid means of achieving top in search engines and pay per click seo for example some of the attention is placed on the web page layout design and how content and information is displayed to the website visitor edit ethical questions paid search advertising has not been without controversy and the issue of how search engines present advertising on their search result pages has been the target of a series of studies and reports 17 18 19 by consumer reports webwatch the federal trade commission ftc also issued a letter 20 in 2002 about the importance of disclosure of paid advertising on search engines in response to a complaint from commercial alert a consumer advocacy group with ties to ralph nader another ethical controversy associated with search marketing has been the issue of trademark infringement the debate as to whether third parties should have the right to bid on their competitors brand names has been underway for years in 2009 google changed their policy which formerly prohibited these tactics allowing 3rd parties to bid on branded terms as long as their landing page in fact provides information on the trademarked term 21 though the policy has been changed this continues to be a source of heated debate 22 at the end of february 2011 many started to see that google has started to penalize companies that are buying links for the purpose of passing off the rank sem has however nothing to do with link buying and focuses on organic seo and ppc management edit examples adwords is recognised as a web based advertising utensil since it adopts keywords which can deliver adverts explicitly to web users looking for information in respect to a certain product or service this project is highly practical for advertisers as the project hinges on cost per click cpc pricing thus the payment of the service only applies if their advert has been clicked on sem companies have embarked on adwords projects as a way to publicize their sem and seo services this promotion has helped their business elaborate offering added value to consumers who endeavor to employ adwords for promoting their products and services one of the most successful approaches to the strategy of this project was to focus on making sure that ppc advertising funds were prudently invested moreover sem companies have described adwords as a fine practical tool for increasing a consumer s investment earnings on internet advertising the use of conversion tracking and google analytics tools was deemed to be practical for presenting to clients the performance of their canvass from click to conversion adwords project has enabled sem companies to train their clients on the utensil and delivers better performance to the canvass the assistance of adword canvass could contribute to the huge success in the growth of web traffic for a number of its consumer s website by as much as 250 in only nine months 23 another way search engine marketing is managed is by contextual advertising here marketers place ads on other sites or portals that carry information relevant to their products so that the ads jump into the circle of vision of browsers who are seeking information from those sites a successful sem plan is the approach to capture the relationships amongst information searchers businesses and search engines search engines were not important to some industries in the past but over the past years the use of search engines for accessing information has become vital to increase business opportunities 24 the use of sem strategic tools for businesses such as tourism can attract potential consumers to view their products but it could also pose various challenges 24 these challenges could be the competition that companies face amongst their industry and other sources of information that could draw the attention of online consumers 24 to assist the combat of challenges the main objective for businesses applying sem is to improve and maintain their ranking as high as possible on serps so that they can gain visibility therefore search engines are adjusting and developing algorithms and the shifting criteria by which web pages are ranked sequentially to combat against search engine misuse and spamming and to supply the most relevant information to searchers 24 this could enhance the relationship amongst information searchers businesses and search engines by understanding the strategies of marketing to attract
