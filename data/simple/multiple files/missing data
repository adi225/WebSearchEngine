in statistics missing data or missing values occur when no data value is stored for the variable in the current observation missing data are a common occurrence and can have a significant effect on

provided for several items or no information is provided for a whole unit some items are more sensitive for nonresponse than others for example items about private subjects such as income dropout is a type of missingness that occurs mostly when studying development over time in this type of study the measurement is repeated after a certain period of time missingness occurs when participants drop out before the test ends and one or more measurements are missing sometimes missing values are caused by the researchers themselves if data collection was not done properly or if mistakes were made with the data entry ader h j mellenbergh g j 2008 and a great deal of missing data arise in cross national research in economics sociology and political science because governments choose not to or fail to report critical statistics for one or more years messner 1992 it is important to question why the data is missing this can help with finding a solution to the problem if the values are missing at random there is still information about each variable in each unit but if the values are missing systematically the problem is more severe because the sample cannot be representative of the population for example a research is done about the relation between iq and income if participants with an over average iq do not answer the question what is your salary the results of the research may show that there is no association between iq and salary while in fact there is a relationship because of these problems methodologists routinely advise researchers to design research so as to minimize the incidence of missing values ader h j mellenbergh g j 2008 edit techniques of dealing with missing data missing data reduce the representativeness of the sample and can therefore distort inferences about the population if it is possible try to think about how to prevent data from missingness before the actual data gathering takes place for example in computer questionnaires it is often not possible to skip a question a question has to be answered otherwise one cannot continue to the next so missing values due to the participant are eliminated by this type of questionnaire though this method may not be permitted by an ethics board overseeing the research and in survey research it is common to make multiple efforts to contact each individual in the sample often sending letters to attempt to persuade those who have decided not to participate to change their minds stoop et al 2010 161 187 however such techniques can either help or hurt in terms of reducing the negative inferential effects of missing data because the kind of people who are willing to be persuaded to participate after initially refusing or not being home are likely to be significantly different from the kinds of people who will still refuse or remain unreachable after additional effort stoop et al 2010 188 198 in situations where missing data are likely to occur the researcher is often advised to plan to use methods of data analysis methods that are robust to missingness an analysis is robust when we are confident that mild to moderate violations of the technique s key assumptions will produce little or no bias or distortion in the conclusions drawn about the population edit imputation main article imputation statistics if it is known that the data analysis technique which is to be used isn t content robust it is good to consider imputing the missing data this can be done in several ways recommended is to use multiple imputations rubin citation needed argued that even with a small number m of repeated imputations m being equal or smaller than 5 the quality of estimation improves enormously in ader h j mellenbergh g j 2008 for most practical purposes 2 or 3 imputations capture most of the relative efficiency that could be captured with a larger number of imputations however low values of m can lead to a substantial loss of statistical power and some scholars now recommend that m be set to values from 20 to 100 or more graham olchowski and gilreath 2007 obviously any multiply imputed data analysis has to be repeated for each of the m imputed data sets and in some cases the relevant statistics have to be combined in a relatively complicated way ader h j mellenbergh g j 2008 examples of imputations are edit partial imputation the expectation maximization algorithm is an approach in which values of the statistics which would be computed if a complete dataset were available are estimated imputed taking into account the pattern of missing data in this approach values for individual missing data items are not usually imputed edit partial deletion methods which involve reducing the data available to a dataset having no missing values include listwise deletion casewise deletion albeit a naive solution pairwise deletion albeit a naive solution edit full analysis methods which take full account of all information available without the distortion resulting from using imputed values as if they were actually observed the expectation maximization algorithm full information maximum likelihood estimation edit interpolation
