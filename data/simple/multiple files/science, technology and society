technology and society sts is the study of how social political and cultural values affect scientific research and technological innovation and how these in turn affect society politics and culture sts scholars are interested in a variety of problems including the relationships between scientific and technological innovations and society and the directions and risks of science and technology more than two dozen universities worldwide offer bachelor s degrees in sts about half of these also offer doctoral or masters degrees an sts model has been developed by the scholars to consider the

edit history sts is a new and expanding subject for example in 2011 globally the existence of 111 sts programs has been counted 1 like most interdisciplinary programs it emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields all of which had developed an interest typically during the 1960s or 1970s in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises edit early developments the key disciplinary components of sts took shape independently beginning in the 1960s and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s although ludwig fleck s monograph 1935 genesis and development of a scientific fact anticipated many of sts s key themes science studies a branch of the sociology of scientific knowledge that places scientific controversies in their social context history of technology that examines technology in its social and historical context starting in the 1960s some historians questioned technological determinism a doctrine that can induce public passivity to technologic and scientific natural development at the same time some historians began to develop similarly contextual approaches to the history of medicine history and philosophy of science 1960s after the publication of thomas kuhn s well known the structure of scientific revolutions 1962 which attributed changes in scientific theories to changes in underlying intellectual paradigms programs were founded at the university of california berkeley and elsewhere that brought historians of science and philosophers together in unified programs science technology and society in the mid to late 1960s student and faculty social movements in the u s uk and european universities helped to launch a range of new interdisciplinary fields such as women s studies that were seen to address relevant topics that the traditional curriculum ignored one such development was the rise of science technology and society programs which are also confusingly known by the sts acronym drawn from a variety of disciplines including anthropology history political science and sociology scholars in these programs created undergraduate curricula devoted to exploring the issues raised by science and technology unlike scholars in science studies history of technology or the history and philosophy of science they were and are more likely to see themselves as activists working for change rather than dispassionate ivory tower researchers citation needed as an example of the activist impulse feminist scholars in this and other emerging sts areas addressed themselves to the exclusion of women from science and engineering science engineering and public policy studies emerged in the 1970s from the same concerns that motivated the founders of the science technology and society movement a sense that science and technology were developing in ways that were increasingly at odds with the public s best interests the science technology and society movement tried to humanize those who would make tomorrow s science and technology but this discipline took a different approach it would train students with the professional skills needed to become players in science and technology policy some programs came to emphasize quantitative methodologies and most of these were eventually absorbed into systems engineering others emphasized sociological and qualitative approaches and found that their closest kin could be found among scholars in science technology and society departments citation needed during the 1970s and 1980s leading universities in the us uk and europe began drawing these various components together in new interdisciplinary programs for example in the 1970s cornell university developed a new program that united science studies and policy oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together as well as their location within the various universities for example the university of virginia s sts program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields with particular strength in the history of technology however the program s teaching responsibilities it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in engineering ethics citation needed edit the turn to technology a decisive moment in the development of sts was the mid 1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science during that decade two works appeared en seriatim that signaled what steve woolgar was to call the turn to technology social shaping of technology mackenzie and wajcman 1985 and the social construction of technological systems bijker hughes and pinch 1987 mackenzie and wajcman primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design in a seminal article trevor pinch and wiebe bijker attached all the legitimacy of the sociology of scientific knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge this was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology the turn to technology helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging sts programs more recently there has been an associated turn to materiality whereby the socio technical and material co produce each other this is especially evident in work in sts analyses of biomedicine such as carl may annemarie mol nelly oudshoorn and andrew webster edit professional associations the subject has several professional associations founded in 1975 the society for social studies of science initially provided scholarly communication facilities including a journal science technology and human values and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars but the society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide the society for social studies of science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives proposals have been made to add the word technology to the association s name thereby reflecting its stature as the leading sts professional society but there seems to be widespread sentiment that the name is long enough as it is in europe the european association for the study of science and technology easst 2 was founded in 1981 to stimulate communication exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology similarly the european inter university association on society science and technology esst researches and studies science and technology in society in both historical and contemporary perspectives in japan the japanese society for science and technology studies jssts 3 was founded in 2001 founded in 1958 the society for the history of technology initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology after the turn to technology in the mid 1980s the society s well regarded journal technology and culture and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non historians with technology studies interests less identified with sts but also of importance to many sts scholars in the us are the history of science society the philosophy of science association and the american association for the history of medicine in addition there are significant sts oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations including the american anthropological association the american political science association and the american sociological association edit journals important journals in sts are social studies of science science technology and human values research policy minerva a journal of science learning and policy science technology and society science as culture technology and culture and science and public policy student journals in sts are intersect the journal of science
