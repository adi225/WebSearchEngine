and artistic works discoveries and inventions and words phrases symbols and designs common types of intellectual property rights include copyright trademarks patents industrial design rights trade dress and in some jurisdictions trade secrets although many of the legal principles governing intellectual property rights have evolved over centuries it was not until the 19th century that the term intellectual property began to be used and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world 2 the british statute of anne 1710 and the statute of monopolies 1623

came into force in 1710 modern usage of the term intellectual property goes back at least as far as 1867 with the founding of the north german confederation whose constitution granted legislative power over the protection of intellectual property schutz des geistigen eigentums to the confederation 4 when the administrative secretariats established by the paris convention 1883 and the berne convention 1886 merged in 1893 they located in berne and also adopted the term intellectual property in their new combined title the united international bureaux for the protection of intellectual property the organisation subsequently relocated to geneva in 1960 and was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the world intellectual property organization wipo by treaty as an agency of the united nations according to lemley it was only at this point that the term really began to be used in the united states which had not been a party to the berne convention 2 and it did not enter popular usage until passage of the bayh dole act in 1980 5 the history of patents does not begin with inventions but rather with royal grants by queen elizabeth i 1558 1603 for monopoly privileges approximately 200 years after the end of elizabeth s reign however a patent represents a legal right obtained by an inventor providing for exclusive control over the production and sale of his mechanical or scientific invention demonstrating the evolution of patents from royal prerogative to common law doctrine 6 in an 1818 collection of his writings the french liberal theorist benjamin constant argued against the recently introduced idea of property which has been called intellectual 7 the term intellectual property can be found used in an october 1845 massachusetts circuit court ruling in the patent case davoll et al v brown in which justice charles l woodbury wrote that only in this way can we protect intellectual property the labors of the mind productions and interests are as much a man s own as the wheat he cultivates or the flocks he rears 8 the statement that discoveries are property goes back earlier section 1 of the french law of 1791 stated all new discoveries are the property of the author to assure the inventor the property and temporary enjoyment of his discovery there shall be delivered to him a patent for five ten or fifteen years 9 in europe french author a nion mentioned propri t intellectuelle in his droits civils des auteurs artistes et inventeurs published in 1846 until recently the purpose of intellectual property law was to give as little protection possible in order to encourage innovation historically therefore they were granted only when they were necessary to encourage invention limited in time and scope 10 the concept s origins can potentially be traced back further jewish law includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist notably the principle of hasagat ge vul unfair encroachment was used to justify limited term publisher but not author copyright in the 16th century 11 in 500 bce the government of the greek state of sybaris offered one year s patent to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury 12 edit types common types of intellectual property rights include patents copyright industrial design rights trademarks trade dress and in some jurisdictions trade secrets there are also more specialized varieties of sui generis exclusive rights such as circuit design rights called mask work rights in usa law protected under the integrated circuit topography act in canadian law and in european union law by directive 87 54 eec of 16 december 1986 on the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products plant breeders rights plant variety rights industrial design rights supplementary protection certificates for pharmaceutical products and database rights in european law edit patents main article patent a patent grants an inventor exclusive rights to make use sell and import an invention for a limited period of time in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention an invention is a solution to a specific technological problem which may be a product or a process 13 17 edit copyright main article copyright a copyright gives the creator of an original work exclusive rights to it usually for a limited time copyright may apply to a wide range of creative intellectual or artistic forms or works 14 15 copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves only the form or manner in which they are expressed 16 edit industrial design rights main article industrial design rights an industrial design right protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian an industrial design consists of the creation of a shape configuration or composition of pattern or color or combination of pattern and color in three dimensional form containing aesthetic value an industrial design can be a two or three dimensional pattern used to produce a product industrial commodity or handicraft edit trademarks main article trademark a trademark is a recognizable sign design or expression which identifies products or services of a particular source from those of others 17 18 19 edit trade dress main article trade dress trade dress is a legal term of art that generally refers to characteristics of the visual appearance of a product or its packaging or even the design of a building that signify the source of the product to consumers 20 edit trade secrets main article trade secret a trade secret is a formula practice process design instrument pattern or compilation of information which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers in the us trade secret law is primarily handled at the state level under the uniform trade secrets act which most states have adopted and a federal law the economic espionage act of 1996 18 u s c 160 160 1831 1839 which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime this law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity the first 18 u s c 160 160 1831 a criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers the second 18 u s c 160 160 1832 criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes the statutory penalties are different for the two offenses trade secret law varies from country to country 13 150 153 edit objectives the stated objective of most intellectual property law with the exception of trademarks is to promote progress 21 by exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works society and the patentee copyright owner mutually benefit and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be absolute protection if some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation they reason more is better the thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions 22 this absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of real property typically adopting its law and rhetoric other recent developments in intellectual property law such as the america invents act stress international harmonization edit financial incentive these exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property and in case of patents pay associated research and development costs 23 some commentators such as david levine and michele boldrin dispute this justification 24 edit economic growth the wipo treaty and several related international agreements are premised on the notion that the protection of intellectual property rights are essential to maintaining economic growth the wipo intellectual property handbook gives two reasons for intellectual property laws one is to give statutory expression to the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations and the rights of the public in access to those creations the second is to promote as a deliberate act of government policy creativity and the dissemination and application of its results and to encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development 25 the anti counterfeiting trade agreement acta states that effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally 26 economists estimate that two thirds of the value of large businesses in the u s can be traced to intangible assets 27 ip intensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added price minus material cost per employee than non ip intensive industries 28 dubious discuss a joint research project of the wipo and the united nations university measuring the impact of ip systems on six asian countries found a positive correlation between the strengthening of the ip system and subsequent economic growth 29 economists have also shown that ip can be a disincentive to innovation when that innovation is drastic ip makes excludable non rival intellectual products that were previously non excludable this creates economic inefficiency as long as the monopoly is held a disincentive to direct resources toward innovation can occur when monopoly profits are less than the overall welfare improvement to society this situation can be seen as a market failure and an issue of appropriability 30 edit morality according to article 27 of the universal declaration of human rights everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific literary or artistic production of which he is the author 31 although the relationship between intellectual property and human rights is a complex one 32 there are moral arguments for intellectual property the arguments that justify intellectual property fall into three major categories personality theorists believe intellectual property is an extension of an individual utilitarians believe that intellectual property stimulates social progress and pushes people to further innovation lokeans argue that intellectual property is justified based on deservedness and hard work various moral justifications for private property can be used to argue in favor of the morality of intellectual property such as natural rights justice argument this argument is based on locke s idea that a person has a natural right over the labour and or products which is produced by his her body appropriating these products is viewed as unjust although locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind 33 it is possible to apply his argument to intellectual property rights in which it would be unjust for people to misuse another s ideas 34 lokeans argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create they argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers this right of ownership extends to what we create thus intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production utilitarian pragmatic argument according to this rationale a society that protects private property is more effective and prosperous than societies that do not innovation and invention in 19th century america has been said to be attributed to the development of the patent system 35 by providing innovators with durable and tangible return on their investment of time labor and other resources intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility 36 the presumption is that they promote public welfare by encouraging the creation production and distribution of intellectual works 37 utilitarians argue that without intellectual property there would be a lack of incentive to produce new ideas systems of protection such as intellectual property optimize social utility personality argument this argument is based on a quote from hegel every man has the right to turn his will upon a thing or make the thing an object of his will that is to say to set aside the mere thing and recreate it as his own 38 european intellectual property law is shaped by this notion that ideas are an extension of oneself and of one s personality 39 personality theorists argue that by being a creator of something one is inherently at risk and vulnerable for having their ideas and designs stolen and or altered intellectual property protects these moral claims that have to do with personality lysander spooner 1855 argues that a man has a natural and absolute right and if a natural and absolute then necessarily a perpetual right of property in the ideas of which he is the discoverer or creator that his right of property in ideas is intrinsically the same as and stands on identically the same grounds with his right of property in material things that no distinction of principle exists between the two cases 40 writer ayn rand argued in her book capitalism the unknown ideal that the protection of intellectual property is essentially a moral issue the belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property to violate intellectual property is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights which compromises the very processes of survival and therefore constitutes an immoral act 41 edit criticisms demonstration in sweden in support of file sharing 2006 copying is not theft badge with a character resembling mickey mouse in reference to the in popular culture rationale behind the sonny bono copyright term extension act of 1998 some critics of intellectual property such as those in the free culture movement characterize it as intellectual protectionism intellectual monopoly or government granted monopoly and argue the public interest is harmed by protectionist legislation such as copyright extension software patents and business method patents a critique against the idea of intellectual property has been formulated by eben moglen in his dotcommunist manifesto society confronts the simple fact that when everyone can possess every intellectual work of beauty and utility reaping all the human value of every increase of knowledge at the same cost that any one person can possess them it is no longer moral to exclude if rome possessed the power to feed everyone amply at no greater cost than that of caesar s own table the people would sweep caesar violently away if anyone were left to starve but the bourgeois system of ownership demands that knowledge and culture be rationed by the ability to pay eben moglen dotcommunist manifesto 42 edit the term itself free software foundation founder richard stallman argues that although the term intellectual property is in wide use it should be rejected altogether because it systematically distorts and confuses these issues and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion he claims that the term operates as a catch all to lump together disparate laws which originated separately evolved differently cover different activities have different rules and raise different public policy issues and that it creates a bias by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things likening them to property rights 43 stallman advocates referring to copyrights patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term similarly boldrin and levine prefer to use the term intellectual monopoly as a more appropriate and clear definition of the concept 44 lawrence lessig along with many other copyleft and free software activists have criticized the implied analogy with physical property like land or an automobile they argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non rivalrous that is if one makes a copy of a work the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original 45 46 other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with tangible property there is no natural scarcity of a particular idea or information once it exists at all it can be re used and duplicated indefinitely without such re use diminishing the original stephan kinsella has objected to intellectual property on the grounds that the word property implies scarcity which may not be applicable to ideas 47 edit alternative terms in civil law jurisdictions intellectual property has often been referred to as intellectual rights traditionally a somewhat broader concept that has included moral rights and other personal protections that cannot be bought or sold use of the term intellectual rights has declined since the early 1980s as use of the term intellectual property has increased alternative terms monopolies on information and intellectual monopoly have emerged among those who argue against the property or intellect or rights assumptions notably richard stallman the backronyms intellectual protectionism and intellectual poverty 48 whose initials are also ip have found supporters as well especially among those who have used the backronym digital restrictions management 49 50 the argument that an intellectual property right should in the interests of better balancing of relevant private and public interests be termed an intellectual monopoly privilege imp has been advanced by several academics including birgitte andersen 51 and thomas alured faunce 52 edit objections to overbroad intellectual property laws some critics of intellectual property such as those in the free culture movement point at intellectual monopolies as harming health in the case of pharmaceutical patents preventing progress and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses 53 54 55 56 and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions software patents and business method patents more recently scientists and engineers are expressing concern that patent thickets are undermining technological development even in high tech fields such as nanotechnology 57 peter drahos notes that property rights confer authority over resources when authority is granted to the few over resources on which many depend the few gain power over the goals of the many this has consequences for both political and economic freedoms with in a society 58 rp 13 the world intellectual property organization wipo recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights 59 in 2001 the un committee on economic social and cultural rights issued a document called human rights and intellectual property that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product in order to serve human well being intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws according to the committee when systems fail to do so they risk infringing upon the human right to food and health and to cultural participation and scientific benefits 60 61 in 2004 the general assembly of wipo adopted the geneva declaration on the future of the world intellectual property organization which argues that wipo should focus more on the needs of developing countries and to view ip as one of many tools for development not as an end in itself 62 some libertarian critics of intellectual property have argued that allowing property rights in ideas and information creates artificial scarcity and infringes on the right to own tangible property stephan kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point i magine the time when men lived in caves one bright guy let s call him galt magnon decides to build a log cabin on an open field near his crops to be sure this is a good idea and others notice it they naturally imitate galt magnon and they start building their own cabins but the first man to invent a house according to ip advocates would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land with their own logs or to charge them a fee if they do build houses it is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property e g land and logs of others due not to first occupation and use of that property for it is already owned but due to his coming up with an idea clearly this rule flies in the face of the first user homesteading rule arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights 63 thomas jefferson once said in a letter to isaac mcpherson on august 13 1813 if nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property it is the action of the thinking power called an idea which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself but the moment it is divulged it forces itself into the possession of every one and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it its peculiar character too is that no one possesses the less because every other possesses the whole of it he who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mine as he who lights his taper at mine receives light without darkening me 64 in 2005 the rsa launched the adelphi charter aimed at creating an international policy statement to frame how governments should make balanced intellectual property law 65 another limitation of current u s intellectual property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works thus copyright protection can only be obtained in original works of authorship 66 this definition excludes any works that are the result of community creativity for example native american songs and stories current legislation does not recognize the uniqueness of indigenous cultural property and its ever changing nature simply asking native cultures to write down their cultural artifacts on tangible mediums ignores their necessary orality and enforces a western bias of the written form as more authoritative edit expansion in nature and scope of intellectual property laws expansion of u s copyright law assuming authors create their works by age 35 and live for seventy years other criticism of intellectual property law concerns the expansion of intellectual property both in duration and in scope in addition as scientific knowledge has expanded and allowed new industries to arise in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology originators of technology have sought ip protection for the new technologies patents have been granted for living organisms 67 and in the us certain living organisms have been patentable for over a century 68 the increase in terms of protection is particularly seen in relation to copyright which has recently been the subject of serial extensions in the united states and in europe 69 45 70 71 72 with no need for registration or copyright notices this is thought to have led to an increase in orphan works copyrighted works for which the copyright owner cannot be contacted a problem that has been noticed and addressed by governmental bodies around the world 73 also with respect to copyright the american film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization the motion picture association of america in amicus briefs in important cases in lobbying before congress and in its statements to the public the mpaa has advocated strong protection of intellectual property rights in framing its presentations the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor additionally congress s awareness of the position of the united states as the world s largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property 74 these doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry lending the mpaa even more power and authority 75 riaa representative hilary rosen testifies before the senate judiciary committee on the future of digital music july 11 2000 the growth of the internet and particularly distributed search engines like kazaa and gnutella have represented a challenge for copyright policy the recording industry association of america in particular has been on the front lines of the fight against copyright infringement which the industry calls piracy the industry has had victories against some services including a highly publicized case against the file sharing company napster and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright the electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software based digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works laws such as the digital millennium copyright act have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems equivalent provisions to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in eu for some time and are being expanded in for example article 6 and 7 the copyright directive other examples are article 7 of the software directive of 1991 91 250 eec and the conditional access directive of 1998 98 84 eec in the context of trademarks this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of trademark as exemplified by the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights ratified in 1994 which formalized regulations for ip rights that had been handled by common law or not at all in member states pursuant to trips any sign which is capable of distinguishing the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark 76 edit ethics the ethical problems brought up by ip rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like life saving medicines and genetically modified gm seeds that are given ip protection for example some pharmaceutical companies that have developed these gm seeds have applied for and in some cases won ip rights in order to prevent other companies from manufacturing their product without the additional cost of research and development the application of ip rights can allow companies to charge higher than the marginal cost of production in order to recoup the costs of research and development 77 however this immediately excludes from the market anyone who cannot afford the cost of the product in this case a life saving drug the availability problem is a consequence of the fact that the incentivizing mechanism for innovation constituted by iprs establishes a direct link between the incentive to innovate and the price of the innovative product under an ipr driven regime profits are generated exclusively from sales this means that the higher a price a product can command on the market the higher is the incentive to invest resources into the r amp d process of it an ipr driven regime is therefore not a regime that is conductive to the investment of r amp d of products that are socially valuable to predominately poor populations 78 edit see also wikiquote has a collection of quotations related to intellectual
