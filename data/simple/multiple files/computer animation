unsourced material may be challenged and removed november 2009 an example of computer animation which is produced in the motion capture technique computer animation is the process used for generating animated images by using computer graphics the more general term computer generated imagery encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images while computer animation only refers to moving images modern computer animation usually uses 3d 160 computer graphics although 2d 160 computer graphics are still used for stylistic low bandwidth and faster real time renderings sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself but sometimes the target is another medium such as film computer animation is essentially a digital successor to the stop motion techniques used in traditional animation with 3d models and frame by frame animation of 2d illustrations computer generated animations are more controllable than other more physically based processes such as constructing miniatures for effects shots or hiring extras for crowd scenes and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology it can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors expensive set pieces or props to create the illusion of movement an image is displayed on the computer screen and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to it but advanced slightly in time usually at a rate of 24 or 30 frames second this technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with television and motion pictures for 3d animations objects models are built on the computer monitor modeled and 3d figures are rigged with a virtual skeleton for 2d figure animations separate objects illustrations and separate transparent layers are used with or without a virtual skeleton then the limbs eyes mouth clothes etc of the figure are moved by the animator on key frames the differences in appearance between key frames are automatically calculated by the computer in a process known as tweening or morphing finally the animation is rendered for 3d animations all frames must be rendered after modeling is complete for 2d vector animations the rendering process is the key frame illustration process while tweened frames are rendered as needed for pre recorded presentations the rendered frames are transferred to a different format or medium such as film or digital video the frames may also be rendered in real time as they are presented to the end user audience low bandwidth animations transmitted via the internet e g 160 2d 160 flash x3d often use software on the end users computer to render in real time as an alternative to streaming or pre loaded high bandwidth animations

images in wikipedia 13 references edit a simple example computer animation example the screen is blanked to a background color such as black then a goat is drawn on the screen next the screen is blanked but the goat is re drawn or duplicated slightly to the left of its original position this process is repeated each time moving the goat a bit to the left if this process is repeated fast enough the goat will appear to move smoothly to the left this basic procedure is used for all moving pictures in films and television the moving goat is an example of shifting the location of an object more complex transformations of object properties such as size shape lighting effects often require calculations and computer rendering instead of simple re drawing or duplication edit explanation to trick the eye and brain into thinking they are seeing a smoothly moving object the pictures should be drawn at around 12 frames per second frame s or faster a frame is one complete image with rates above 75 120 frames s no improvement in realism or smoothness is perceivable due to the way the eye and brain process images at rates below 12 frame s most people can detect jerkiness associated with the drawing of new images which detracts from the illusion of realistic movement conventional hand drawn cartoon animation often uses 15 frames s in order to save on the number of drawings needed but this is usually accepted because of the stylized nature of cartoons because it produces more realistic imagery computer animation demands higher frame rates to reinforce this realism movie film seen in theaters in the united states runs at 24 frames per second which is sufficient to create the illusion of continuous movement for high resolution adapters are used edit history main article history of computer animation see also timeline of computer animation in film and television some of the earliest animation done using a digital computer was done at bell telephone laboratories in the first half of the 1960s by edward e zajac frank w sinden kenneth c knowlton and a michael noll early digital animation was also done at lawrence livermore laboratory another early step in the history of computer animation was the 1973 movie westworld a science fiction film about a society in which robots live and work among humans though the first use of 3d wireframe imagery was in its sequel futureworld 1976 which featured a computer generated hand and face created by then university of utah graduate students edwin catmull and fred parke developments in cgi technologies are reported each year at siggraph an annual conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques attended each year by tens of thousands of computer professionals developers of computer games and 3d video cards strive to achieve the same visual quality on personal computers in real time as is possible for cgi films and animation with the rapid advancement of real time rendering quality artists began to use game engines to render non interactive movies this art form is called machinima the first feature length computer animated film was the 1995 movie toy story by pixar citation needed it followed an adventure centered around some toys and their owners the groundbreaking film was the first of many fully computer animated films computer animation helped make blockbuster films such as toy story 3 2010 disney pixar avatar 2009 shrek 2 2004 dreamworks animation and cars 2 2011 disney pixar edit methods of animating virtual characters in this gif of a 2d flash animation each stick of the figure is keyframed over time to create motion in most 3d computer animation systems an animator creates a simplified representation of a character s anatomy analogous to a skeleton or stick figure the position of each segment of the skeletal model is defined by animation variables or avars in human and animal characters many parts of the skeletal model correspond to actual bones but skeletal animation is also used to animate other things such as facial features though other methods for facial animation exist the character woody in toy story for example uses 700 avars including 100 avars in the face the computer does not usually render the skeletal model directly it is invisible but uses the skeletal model to compute the exact position and orientation of the character which is eventually rendered into an image thus by changing the values of avars over time the animator creates motion by making the character move from frame to frame there are several methods for generating the avar values to obtain realistic motion traditionally animators manipulate the avars directly rather than set avars for every frame they usually set avars at strategic points frames in time and let the computer interpolate or tween between them a process called keyframing keyframing puts control in the hands of the animator and has roots in hand drawn traditional animation in contrast a newer method called motion capture makes use of live action when computer animation is driven by motion capture a real performer acts out the scene as if they were the character to be animated his or her motion is recorded to a computer using video cameras and markers and that performance is then applied to the animated character each method has its advantages and as of 2007 games and films are using either or both of these methods in productions keyframe animation can produce motions that would be difficult or impossible to act out while motion capture can reproduce the subtleties of a particular actor for example in the 2006 film pirates of the caribbean dead man s chest actor bill nighy provided the performance for the character davy jones even though nighy himself doesn t appear in the film the movie benefited from his performance by recording the nuances of his body language posture facial expressions etc thus motion capture is appropriate in situations where believable realistic behavior and action is required but the types of characters required exceed what can be done through conventional costuming edit creating characters and objects on a computer 3d computer animation combines 3d models of objects and programmed or hand keyframed movement models are constructed out of geometrical vertices faces and edges in a 3d coordinate system objects are sculpted much like real clay or plaster working from general forms to specific details with various sculpting tools a bone joint animation system is set up to deform the cgi model e g to make a humanoid model walk in a process called rigging the virtual marionette is given various controllers and handles for controlling movement animation data can be created using motion capture or keyframing by a human animator or a combination of the two 3d models rigged for animation may contain thousands of control points for example the character woody in pixar s movie toy story uses 700 specialized animation controllers rhythm and hues studios labored for two years to create aslan in the movie the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe which had about 1851 controllers 742 in just the face alone in the 2004 film the day after tomorrow designers had to design forces of extreme weather with the help of video references and accurate meteorological facts for the 2005 remake of king kong actor andy serkis was used to help designers pinpoint the gorilla s prime location in the shots and used his expressions to model human characteristics onto the creature serkis had earlier provided the voice and performance for gollum in j r r tolkien s the lord of the rings trilogy edit computer animation development equipment a ray traced 3 d model of a jack inside a cube and the jack alone below computer animation can be created with a computer and animation software some impressive animation can be achieved even with basic programs however the rendering can take a lot of time on an ordinary home computer because of this video game animators tend to use low resolution low polygon count renders such that the graphics can be rendered in real time on a home computer photorealistic animation would be impractical in this context professional animators of movies television and video sequences on computer games make photorealistic animation with high detail this level of quality for movie animation would take tens to hundreds of years to create on a home computer many powerful workstation computers are used instead graphics workstation computers use two to four processors and thus are a lot more powerful than a home computer and are specialized for rendering a large number of workstations known as a render farm are networked together to effectively act as a giant computer the result is a computer animated movie that can be completed in about one to five years this process is not comprised solely of rendering however a workstation typically costs 2 000 to 16 000 with the more expensive stations being able to render much faster due to the more technologically advanced hardware that they contain professionals also use digital movie cameras motion capture or performance capture bluescreens film editing software props and other tools for movie animation edit modeling human faces main article computer facial animation the realistic modeling of human facial features is both one of the most challenging and sought after elements in computer generated imagery computer facial animation is a highly complex field where models typically include a very large number of animation variables historically speaking the first siggraph tutorials on state of the art in facial animation in 1989 and 1990 proved to be a turning point in the field by bringing together and consolidating multiple research elements and sparked interest among a number of researchers 1 the facial action coding system with 46 action units such as lip bite or squint which had been developed in 1976 became a popular basis for many systems 2 as early as 2001 mpeg 4 included 68 facial animation parameters for lips jaws etc and the field has made significant progress since then and the use of facial microexpression has increased 2 3 in some cases an affective space such as the pad emotional state model can be used to assign specific emotions to the faces of avatars in this approach the pad model is used as a high level emotional space and the lower level space is the mpeg 4 facial animation parameters fap a mid level partial expression parameters pep space is then used to in a two level structure the pad pep mapping and the pep fap translation model 4 edit realism in the future of computer animation realism in computer animation can mean making each frame look photorealistic in the sense that the scene is rendered to resemble a photograph or to making the animation of characters believable and lifelike this article focuses on the second definition computer animation can be realistic with or without photorealistic rendering one of the greatest challenges in computer animation has been creating human characters that look and move with the highest degree of realism many animated films instead feature characters that are anthropomorphic animals finding nemo ice age bolt madagascar over the hedge rio kung fu panda fantastic mr fox

like proportions the incredibles despicable me up megamind jimmy neutron boy genius planet 51 hotel transylvania part of the difficulty in making pleasing realistic human characters is the uncanny valley a concept where up to a point people have an increasingly negative emotional response as a human replica looks and acts more and more human also some materials that commonly appear in a scene like cloth foliage fluids and hair have proven more difficult to faithfully recreate and animate than others consequently special software and techniques have been developed to better simulate these specific elements in theory realistic computer animation can reach a point where it is indistinguishable from real action captured on film where computer animation achieves this level of realism it may have major repercussions for the film industry citation needed the goal of computer animation is not always to emulate live action as closely as possible computer animation can also be tailored to mimic or substitute for other types of animation such as traditional stop motion animation flushed away some of the long standing basic principles of animation like squash amp stretch call for movement that is not strictly realistic and such principles still see widespread application in computer animation edit media notable for realistic human characters final fantasy the spirits within

animated films for more edit amateur animation the popularity of websites that allow members to upload their own movies for others to view has created a growing community of amateur computer animators with utilities and programs often included free with modern operating systems many users can make their own animated movies and shorts several free and open source animation software applications exist as well a popular amateur approach to animation is via the animated gif format which can be uploaded and seen on the web easily edit detailed examples and pseudocode in 2d computer animation moving objects are often referred to as sprites a sprite is an image that has a location associated with it the location of the sprite is changed slightly between each displayed frame to make the sprite appear to move the following pseudocode makes a sprite move from left to right var int x 0 y screenheight 2 while x lt screenwidth drawbackground drawspriteatxy x y draw on top of the background x x 5 move to the right computer animation uses different techniques to produce animations most frequently sophisticated mathematics is used to manipulate complex three dimensional polygons apply textures lighting and other effects to the polygons and finally rendering the complete image a sophisticated graphical user interface may be used to create the animation and arrange its choreography another technique called constructive solid geometry defines objects by conducting boolean operations on regular shapes and has the advantage that animations may be accurately produced at any resolution let s step through the rendering of a simple image of a room with flat wood walls with a grey pyramid in the center of the room the pyramid will have a spotlight shining on it each wall the floor and the ceiling is a simple polygon in this case a rectangle each corner of the rectangles is defined by three values referred to as x y and z x is how far left and right the point is y is how far up and down the point is and z is far in and out of the screen the point is the wall nearest us would be defined by four points in the order x y z below is a representation of how the wall is defined 0 10 0 10 10 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 the far wall would be 0 10 20 10 10 20 0 0 20 10 0 20 the pyramid is made up of five polygons the rectangular base and four triangular sides to draw this image the computer uses math to calculate how to project this image defined by three dimensional data onto a two dimensional computer screen first we must also define where our view point is that is from what vantage point will the scene be drawn our view point is inside the room a bit above the floor directly in front of the pyramid first the computer will calculate which polygons are visible the near wall will not be displayed at all as it is behind our view point the far side of the pyramid will also not be drawn as it is hidden by the front of the pyramid next each point is perspective projected onto the screen the portions of the walls furthest from the view point will appear to be shorter than the nearer areas due to perspective to make the walls look like wood a wood pattern called a texture will be drawn on them to accomplish this a technique called texture mapping is often used a small drawing of wood that can be repeatedly drawn in a matching tiled pattern like desktop wallpaper is stretched and drawn onto the walls final shape the pyramid is solid grey so its surfaces can just be rendered as grey but we also have a spotlight where its light falls we lighten colors where objects blocks the light we darken colors next we render the complete scene on the computer screen if the numbers describing the position of the pyramid were changed and this process repeated the pyramid would appear to move edit see also animation portal computer graphics portal animation animation database avar animation variable computer generated imagery cgi computer graphics lab
