jhepwork jwork developer s primary developer dr s chekanov stable release 3 8 january 2013 written in java jython operating system cross platform type data analysis license mixed the core engine is gpl but the installer documentation and other components are only free for non commercial purposes website jwork org jhepwork jhepwork or jwork is an interactive framework for scientific computation data analysis and data visualization designed for scientists engineers and students jhepwork is multiplatform since it is written in java thus it runs on any operating system where the java virtual machine can be installed the program is designed for interactive scientific plots in 2d and 3d and contains numerical scientific libraries implemented in java for mathematical functions random numbers statistical analysis curve fitting and other data mining algorithms jhepwork uses high level programming languages such as jython python implemented in java jruby ruby implemented in java but java coding can also be used to call jhepwork numerical and graphical libraries jhepwork is an attempt to create a data analysis environment using open source packages with a coherent user interface and tools competitive to commercial programs the idea behind the project is to incorporate open source mathematical and numerical software packages with gui type of user interfaces into a coherent program in which the main user interface is based on short named java python classes this was required to build an analysis environment using java scripting concept a typical example will be shown below hepwork runs on any platforms windows mac linux etc where java can be installed scripts and java code in case of the java programming can be run either in a gui editor of jhepwork or as batch programs the graphical libraries of jhepwork can be used to create applets all charts or canvases used for data representation can be embedded into web browsers jhepwork can be used everywhere where an analysis of large numerical data volumes data mining statistical data analysis and mathematics are essential the program can be used in natural sciences engineering modeling and analysis of financial markets jhepwork is considered among five best free and open source data mining software 1 there are several other jhepwork reviews available 2 3 while the program falls into the category of open source software it is not completely free for commercial usage see below contents 1 overview 2 data analysis features 3 symbolic and numeric calculations 4 input and output 5 history 6 supported platforms 7 license terms 8 external links 9 technical manual 10 examples of jython scripts 11 see also 12 references edit overview jhepwork has several features useful for data analysis uses jython jruby or beanshell scripting or the standard java the gnu octave mode is also available for symbolic calculations can be integrated with the web in forms of applets or java web start applications thus it is suited for distributed analysis environment via the internet jhepwork is designed from the ground up to support programming with multiple threads has a full featured ide with syntax highlighting syntax checker code completion and analyser it includes a version of ide for small screen devices includes a help system with a code completion based on the java reflection technology uses a platform neutral i o based on google s protocol buffers data can be written in c and analyzed using java jython databases object databases and sql based databases has a browser for serialized objects and objects created using google protocol buffers includes packages for statistical calculations symbolic calculations similar to those found in the gnu octave project or matlab but rewritten in java jmathlab project edit data analysis features the package supports several mathematical data analysis and data mining features 2d and 3d interactive visualization of data functions histograms charts analytic calculations using matlab or octave syntax histograms in 2d and 3d as well as profile histograms random numbers and statistical samples functions including parametric equations in 3d contour plots scatter plots neural networks linear regression and curve fitting using several minimization techniques clustering analysis k means clustering analysis single and multi pass fuzzy c means algorithm agglomerative hierarchical clustering input output for all data objects arrays functions histograms are based on java serialization there is also a support for i o from to c and other languages using the google s protocol buffer format several databases are supported java object databases and sql based cellular automation output to high quality vector graphics support for postscript eps pdf and raster formats edit symbolic and numeric calculations symbolic calculations use gnu octave scipting language the following methods are available systems of polynomial equations solving vectors and matrix algebra factorization derivatives integrals rational functions boolean algebra simplification geometric algebra edit input and output jhepwork includes the native java and python methods for file input and outputs in addition it allows to write data in the following formats the hfile format based on java serialization optionally compression and xml serialization are supported data can be written sequentially or using the key value maps the pfile format based on the protocol biffers engine for multiplatform input output the hbook format which is a simplified xml format to write large data structures without xml tags arbitrary data structure can be written into object databases with file system as back end this allows writing large data collections to files which normally do not fit into the computer memory several sql database engines are included as external packages aida computing file format read only root computing file format read only data stored in external files can be viewed using browsers for convenient visualization edit history jhepwork has its roots in particle physics where data mining is a primary task jhepwork was initially written for data analysis for particle physics 4 using the java software concept for international linear collider project developed at slac later versions of jhepwork were modified for general public use for scientists engineers students for educational purpose since the international linear collider project has stalled currently jhepwork is a community supported program the main source of reference is the book scientific data analysis using jython scripting and java 5 which discusses in depth data analysis methods using java and jython scripting the string hep in the project name jhepwork abbreviates high energy physics but due to a wide popularity outside this area of physics there is a trend to call the project shortly as jwork thus skipping the abbreviation hep edit supported platforms jhepwork runs on windows linux mac and the android platforms the package for the android is called awork edit license terms the core source code of the numerical and graphical libraries is licensed by the gnu general public license the interactive development environment ide used by jhepwork has some restrictions for commercial usage since language files documentation files examples installer code assist databases interactive help are licensed by the creative common license full members of the jhepwork project have several benefits such as the license for a commercial usage access to the source repository an extended help system a user script repository and an access to the complete documentation edit external links jhepwork main page tutorials jhepwork mirror page

script illustrates how to glue and mix the native java classes from the package java util and jhepwork classes the package jhplot inside a script written using the python syntax from java util import
