secondary winding used to provide split phase power for residential and light commercial service which in north america is typically rated 120 240 volt 1 2 a transformer is a static electrical device that transfers energy by inductive coupling between its winding circuits a varying current in the primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the transformer s core and thus a varying magnetic flux through the secondary winding this varying magnetic flux induces a varying electromotive force emf or voltage in the secondary winding transformers range in size from a thumbnail sized coupling

edit discovery faraday s experiment with induction between coils of wire 3 the principle behind the operation of a transformer electromagnetic induction was discovered independently by michael faraday and joseph henry in 1831 however faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments and thus receive credit for the discovery 4 the relationship between electromotive force emf or voltage and magnetic flux was formalized in an equation now referred to as faraday s law of induction where is the magnitude of the emf in volts and b is the magnetic flux through the circuit in webers 5 faraday performed the first experiments on induction between coils of wire including winding a pair of coils around an iron ring thus creating the first toroidal closed core transformer 6 however he only applied individual pulses of current to his transformer and never discovered the relation between the turns ratio and emf in the windings edit induction coils faraday s ring transformer the first type of transformer to see wide use was the induction coil invented by rev nicholas callan of maynooth college ireland in 1836 he was one of the first researchers to realize that the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding the larger is the increase in emf induction coils evolved from scientists and inventors efforts to get higher voltages from batteries since batteries produce direct current dc rather than alternating current ac induction coils relied upon vibrating electrical contacts that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction between the 1830s and the 1870s efforts to build better induction coils mostly by trial and error slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers edit transformers and power distribution edit early devices for use with alternating current by the 1870s efficient generators that produced alternating current alternators were available and it was found that alternating current could power an induction coil directly without an interrupter in 1876 russian engineer pavel yablochkov invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of alternating current and the secondary windings could be connected to several electric candles arc lamps of his own design 7 8 the coils yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers 7 in 1878 the ganz factory budapest hungary began manufacturing equipment for electric lighting and by 1883 had installed over fifty systems in austria hungary their systems used alternating current exclusively and included those comprising both arc and incandescent lamps along with generators and other equipment 9 lucien gaulard and john dixon gibbs first exhibited a device with an open iron core called a secondary generator in london in 1882 then sold the idea to the westinghouse company in the united states 10 they also exhibited the invention in turin italy in 1884 where it was adopted for an electric lighting system 11 however the efficiency of their open core bipolar apparatus remained very low 11 edit early series circuit transformer distribution induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient for transfer of power to loads until about 1880 the paradigm for ac power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit open core transformers with a ratio near 1 1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps the inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp or other electric device affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil 11 efficient practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s but within a decade the transformer would be instrumental in the war of currents and in seeing ac distribution systems triumph over their dc counterparts a position in which they have remained dominant ever since 12 shell form transformer sketch used by uppenborn to describe z b d engineers 1885 patents and earliest articles 11 core form front shell form back earliest specimens of z b d designed high efficiency constant potential transformers manufactured at the ganz factory in 1885 the z b d team consisted of k roly zipernowsky ott bl thy and miksa d ri stanley s 1886 design for adjustable gap open core induction coils 13 edit closed core transformers and parallel power distribution in the autumn of 1884 k roly zipernowsky ott bl thy and miksa d ri z b d three engineers associated with the ganz factory had determined that open core devices were impracticable as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage 14 in their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers later called z b d transformers they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a wound around iron wire ring core or b 160 surrounded by iron wire core 11 the two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer construction in common use to this day which can as a class all be termed as either core form or shell form or alternatively core type or shell type as in a or b respectively see images 15 16 17 18 the ganz factory had also in the autumn of 1884 made delivery of the world s first five high efficiency ac transformers the first of these units having been shipped on september 16 1884 19 this first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications 1 400 w 40 160 hz 120 72 v 11 6 19 4 a ratio 1 67 1 one phase shell form 19 in both designs the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core with no intentional path through air see toroidal cores below the new transformers were 3 4 times more efficient than the open core bipolar devices of gaulard and gibbs 20 their patents included two other major interrelated innovations one concerning the use of parallel connected instead of series connected utilization loads the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher initially 1 400 to 2 000 v than the voltage of utilization loads 100 v initially preferred 21 22 when they employed them in parallel connected electric distribution systems closed core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes businesses and public spaces 23 24 bl thy had suggested the use of closed cores zipernowsky the use of parallel shunt connections and d ri had performed the experiments 25 transformers in use today are designed based on principles discovered by the three engineers they also popularized the word transformer to describe a device for altering the emf of an electric current 23 26 although the term had already been in use by 1882 27 28 in 1886 the z b d engineers designed and the ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for the world s first power station that used ac generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network the steam powered rome cerchi power plant 29 although george westinghouse had bought gaulard and gibbs patents in 1885 the edison electric light company held an option on the u s rights for the z b d transformers requiring westinghouse to pursue alternative designs on the same principles he assigned to william stanley the task of developing a device for commercial use in united states 30 stanley s first patented design was for induction coils with single cores of soft iron and adjustable gaps to regulate the emf present in the secondary winding see image 13 this design 31 was first used commercially in the u s in 1886 12 but westinghouse was intent on improving the stanley design to make it unlike the z b d type easy and cheap to produce 31 westinghouse stanley and a few other associates had soon developed a core consisting of a stack of thin e shaped iron plates separated individually or in pairs by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material prewound copper coils could then be slid into place and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit westinghouse applied for a patent for the new design in december 1886 it was granted in july 1887 25 32 edit other early transformers in 1889 russian born engineer mikhail dolivo dobrovolsky developed the first three phase transformer at the allgemeine elektricit ts gesellschaft general electricity company in germany 33 in 1891 nikola tesla invented the tesla coil an air cored dual tuned resonant transformer for generating very high voltages at high frequency 34 35 audio frequency transformers repeating coils were used by early experimenters in the development of the telephone citation needed edit basic principles the transformer is based on two principles first that an electric current can produce a magnetic field electromagnetism and second that a changing magnetic field within a coil of wire induces a voltage across the ends of the coil electromagnetic induction changing the current in the primary coil changes the magnetic flux that is developed the changing magnetic flux induces a voltage in the secondary coil an ideal transformer is shown in the figure below current passing through the primary coil creates a magnetic field the primary and secondary coils are wrapped around a core of very high magnetic permeability such as iron so that most of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary coils if a load is connected to the secondary winding the load current and voltage will be in the directions indicated given the primary current and voltage in the directions indicated each will be alternating current in practice edit induction law an ideal voltage stepdown transformer the secondary current arises from the action of the secondary emf on the not shown load impedance the voltage induced across the secondary coil may be calculated from faraday s law of induction which states that where v s is the instantaneous voltage n s is the number of turns in the secondary coil and is the magnetic flux through one turn of the coil if the turns of the coil are oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field lines the flux is the product of the magnetic flux density b and the area a through which it cuts the area is constant being equal to the cross sectional area of the transformer core whereas the magnetic field varies with time according to the excitation of the primary since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary coils in an ideal transformer 36 the instantaneous voltage across the primary winding equals taking the ratio of the two equations for v s and v p gives the basic equation 37 for stepping up or stepping down the voltage n p n s is known as the turns ratio and is the primary functional characteristic of any transformer in the case of step up transformers this may sometimes be stated as the reciprocal n s n p turns ratio is commonly expressed as an irreducible fraction or ratio for example a transformer with primary and secondary windings of respectively 100 and 150 turns is said to have a turns ratio of 2 3 rather than 0 667 or 100 150 edit ideal power equation the ideal transformer as a circuit element if a load is connected to the secondary winding current will flow in this winding and electrical energy will be transferred from the primary circuit through the transformer to the load transformers may be used for ac to ac conversion of a single power frequency or for conversion of signal power over a wide range of frequencies such as audio or radio frequencies in an ideal transformer the induced voltage in the secondary winding v s is in proportion to the primary voltage v p and is given by the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary n s to the number of turns in the primary n p as follows by appropriate selection of the ratio of turns a transformer thus enables an alternating current ac voltage to be stepped up by making n s greater than n p or stepped down by making n s less than n p the windings are coils wound around a ferromagnetic core air core transformers being a notable exception if the secondary coil is attached to a load that allows current to flow electrical power is transmitted from the primary circuit to the secondary circuit ideally the transformer is perfectly efficient all the incoming energy is transformed from the primary circuit to the magnetic field and into the secondary circuit if this condition is met the input electric power must equal the output power giving the ideal transformer equation this formula is a reasonable approximation for commercial transformers if the voltage is increased then the current is decreased by the same factor the impedance in one circuit is transformed by the square of the turns ratio 36 for example if an impedance z s is attached across the terminals of the secondary coil it appears to the primary circuit to have an impedance of n p n s 2 z s this relationship is reciprocal so that the impedance z p of the primary circuit appears to the secondary to be n s n p 2 z p the ideal model neglects the primary current required to establish a magnetic field in the core equivalent to assuming the core has negligible reluctance since the field generated in the core by current in the secondary winding opposes the field of the primary winding current in the primary winding must increase to maintain the same relationship between induced emfs the simple approximation also neglect the non zero resistance of the two windings 38 when a voltage is applied to the primary winding a small current flows driving flux around the magnetic circuit of the core 38 the current required to create the flux is termed the magnetizing current since the ideal core has been assumed to have near zero reluctance the magnetizing current is negligible although still required to create the magnetic field the changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force emf across each winding 39 since the ideal windings have no impedance they have no associated voltage drop and so the voltages v p and v s measured at the terminals of the transformer are equal to the corresponding emfs the primary emf acting as it does in opposition to the primary voltage is sometimes termed the back emf 40 this is in accordance with lenz s law which states that induction of emf always opposes development of any such change in magnetic field edit basic transformer parameters and construction edit leakage flux main article leakage inductance leakage flux of a transformer the ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding including itself in practice some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings 41 such flux is termed leakage flux and results in leakage inductance in series with the mutually coupled transformer windings 40 leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply it is not directly a power loss see stray losses below but results in inferior voltage regulation causing the secondary voltage to not be directly proportional to the primary voltage particularly under heavy load 41 transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance nevertheless it is impossible to eliminate all leakage flux because it plays an essential part in the operation of the transformer the combined effect of the leakage flux and the electric field around the windings is what transfers energy from the primary to the secondary 42 in some applications increased leakage is desired and long magnetic paths air gaps or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the short circuit current it will supply 40 leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit negative resistance such as electric arcs mercury vapor lamps and neon signs or for safely handling loads that become periodically short circuited such as electric arc welders 43 air gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating especially audio frequency transformers in circuits that have a direct current component flowing through the windings 44 knowledge of leakage inductance is for example useful when transformers are operated in parallel it can be shown that if the percent impedance z and associated winding leakage reactance to resistance x r ratio of two transformers were hypothetically exactly the same the transformers would share power in proportion to their respective volt ampere ratings e g 500 kva unit in parallel with 1 000 kva unit the larger unit would carry twice the current however the impedance tolerances of commercial transformers are significant also the z impedance and x r ratio of different capacity transformers tends to vary corresponding 1 000 kva and 500 kva units values being to illustrate respectively z 5 75 x r 3 75 and z 5 x r 4 75 45 46 edit effect of frequency transformer universal emf equation if the flux in the core is purely sinusoidal the relationship for either winding between its rms voltage e rms of the winding and the supply frequency f number of turns n core cross sectional area a in m 2 and peak magnetic flux density b in wb m 2 or t tesla is given by the universal emf equation 38 if the flux does not contain even harmonics the following equation can be used for half cycle average voltage e avg of any waveshape the time derivative term in faraday s law shows that the flux in the core is the integral with respect to time of the applied voltage 47 hypothetically an ideal transformer would work with direct current excitation with the core flux increasing linearly with time 48 in practice the flux rises to the point where magnetic saturation of the core occurs causing a large increase in the magnetizing current and overheating the transformer all practical transformers must therefore operate with alternating or pulsed direct current 48 the emf of a transformer at a given flux density increases with frequency 38 by operating at higher frequencies transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance however properties such as core loss and conductor skin effect also increase with frequency aircraft and military equipment employ 400 160 hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight 49 conversely frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower e g 16 7 160 hz and 25 160 hz than normal utility frequencies 50 60 160 hz for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors as such the transformers used to step down the high over head line voltages e g 15 kv were much heavier for the same power rating than those designed only for the higher frequencies operation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current at a lower frequency the magnetizing current will increase operation of a transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages losses and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical for example transformers may need to be equipped with volts per hertz over excitation relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency one example of state of the art design is traction transformers used for electric multiple unit and high speed train service operating across the country border and using different electrical standards such transformers being restricted to be positioned below the passenger compartment the power supply to and converter equipment being supply by such traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage ranging from as high as 50 hz down to 16 7 160 hz and rated up to 25 kv while being suitable for multiple ac asynchronous motor and dc converters amp motors with varying harmonics mitigation filtering requirements knowledge of natural frequencies of transformer windings is necessary for the determination of winding transient response and switching surge voltages edit energy losses an ideal transformer would have no energy losses and would be 100 efficient in practical transformers energy is dissipated in the windings core and surrounding structures larger transformers are generally more efficient and those rated for electricity distribution usually perform better than 98 50 experimental transformers using superconducting windings achieve efficiencies of 99 85 51 the increase in efficiency can save considerable energy and hence money in a large heavily loaded transformer the trade off is in the additional initial and running cost of the superconducting design losses in transformers excluding associated circuitry vary with load current and may be expressed as no load or full load loss winding resistance dominates load losses whereas hysteresis and eddy current losses contribute to over 99 of the no load loss the no load loss can be significant so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply and a running cost designing transformers for lower loss requires a larger core good quality silicon steel or even amorphous steel for the core and thicker wire increasing initial cost so that there is a trade off between initial cost and running cost also see energy efficient transformer 52 transformer losses arise from winding joule losses current flowing through winding conductors causes joule heating as frequency increases skin effect and proximity effect causes winding resistance and hence losses to increase core losses hysteresis losses each time the magnetic field is reversed a small amount of energy is lost due to hysteresis within the core according to steinmetz s formula the heat energy due to hysteresis is given by and hysteresis loss is thus given by where f is the frequency is the hysteresis coefficient and max is the maximum flux density the empirical exponent of which varies from about 1 4 to 1 8 but is often given as 1 6 for iron 52 53 54 eddy current losses ferromagnetic materials are also good conductors and a core made from such a material also constitutes a single short circuited turn throughout its entire length eddy currents therefore circulate within the core in a plane normal to the flux and are responsible for resistive heating of the core material the eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness 52 eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of plates electrically insulated from each other rather than a solid block all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores magnetostriction related transformer hum magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material such as the core causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field an effect known as magnetostriction the frictional energy of which produces an audible noise known as mains hum or transformer hum 37 55 this transformer hum is especially objectionable in transformers supplied at power frequencies a and in high frequency flyback transformers associated with pal system crts stray losses leakage inductance is by itself largely lossless since energy supplied to its magnetic fields is returned to the supply with the next half cycle however any leakage flux that intercepts nearby conductive materials such as the transformer s support structure will give rise to eddy currents and be converted to heat 56 there are also radiative losses due to the oscillating magnetic field but these are usually small mechanical vibration and audible noise transmission in addition to magnetostriction the alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating forces between the primary and secondary windings this energy incites vibration transmission in interconnected metalwork thus amplifying audible transformer hum 57 edit dot convention main article dot convention it is common in transformer schematic symbols for there to be a dot at the end of each coil within a transformer particularly for transformers with multiple primary and secondary windings the dots indicate the direction of each winding relative to the others voltages at the dot end of each winding are in phase current flowing into the dot end of a primary coil will result in current flowing out of the dot end of a secondary coil edit core form and shell form transformers core form core type shell form shell type closed core transformers are constructed in core form or shell form when windings surround the core the transformer is core form when windings are surrounded by the core the transformer is shell form shell form design may be more prevalent than core form design for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils 15 core form design tends to as a general rule be more economical and therefore more prevalent than shell form design for high voltage power transformer applications at the lower end of their voltage and power rating ranges less than or equal to nominally 230 kv or 75 mva at higher voltage and power ratings shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent 15 18 58 59 shell form design tends to be preferred for extra high voltage and higher mva applications because though more labor intensive to manufacture shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kva to weight ratio better short circuit strength characteristics and higher immunity to transit damage 59 edit equivalent circuit see also steinmetz equivalent circuit referring to the diagram a practical transformer s physical behavior may be represented by an equivalent circuit model which can incorporate an ideal transformer 60 winding joule losses and leakage reactances are represented by the following series loop impedances of the model primary winding r p x p secondary winding r s x s in normal course of circuit equivalence transformation r s and x s are in practice usually referred to the primary side by multiplying these impedances by the scaling factor n p n s 160 2 basic transformer equivalent circuit core loss and reactance is represented by the following shunt leg impedances of the model core or iron losses r c magnetizing reactance x m r c and x m are sometimes collectively termed the magnetizing branch of the model core losses are caused mostly by hysteresis and eddy current effects in the core and are proportional to the square of the core flux for operation at a given frequency 61 the finite permeability core requires a magnetizing current i m to maintain mutual flux in the core magnetizing current is in phase with the flux the relationship between the two being non linear due to saturation effects however all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits 61 with sinusoidal supply core flux lags the induced emf by 160 90 with open circuited secondary winding magnetizing branch current i 0 equals transformer no load current 60 the resulting model though sometimes termed exact equivalent circuit based on linearity assumptions retains a number of approximations 60 analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing branch impedance is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances this introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two series impedances transformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests open circuit test short circuit test winding resistance test and transformer ratio test edit construction edit cores edit laminated steel cores laminated core transformer showing edge of laminations at top of photo transformers for use at power or audio frequencies typically have cores made of high permeability silicon steel 62 the steel has a permeability many times that of free space and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetizing current and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings 63 early transformer developers soon realized that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy current losses and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated iron wires 10 later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations a principle that has remained in use each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non conducting layer of insulation 64 the universal transformer equation indicates a minimum cross sectional area for the core to avoid saturation the effect of laminations is to confine eddy currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux and so reduce their magnitude thinner laminations reduce losses 65 but are more laborious and expensive to construct 66 thin laminations are generally used on high frequency transformers with some of very thin steel laminations able to operate up to 10 160 khz laminating the core greatly reduces eddy current losses one common design of laminated core is made from interleaved stacks of e shaped steel sheets capped with i shaped pieces leading to its name of e i transformer 66 such a design tends to exhibit more losses but is very economical to manufacture the cut core or c core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together it is then cut in two forming two c shapes and the core assembled by binding the two c halves together with a steel strap 66 they have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains reducing reluctance a steel core s remanence means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed when power is then reapplied the residual field will cause a high inrush current until the effect of the remaining magnetism is reduced usually after a few cycles of the applied alternating current 67 overcurrent protection devices such as fuses must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass on transformers connected to long overhead power transmission lines induced currents due to geomagnetic disturbances during solar storms can cause saturation of the core and operation of transformer protection devices 68 distribution transformers can achieve low no load losses by using cores made with low loss high permeability silicon steel or amorphous non crystalline metal alloy the higher initial cost of the core material is offset over the life of the transformer by its lower losses at light load 69 edit solid cores powdered iron cores are used in circuits such as switch mode power supplies that operate above mains frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz these materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical resistivity for frequencies extending beyond the vhf band cores made from non conductive magnetic ceramic materials called ferrites are common 66 some radio frequency transformers also have movable cores sometimes called slugs which allow adjustment of the coupling coefficient and bandwidth of tuned radio frequency circuits edit toroidal cores small toroidal core transformer toroidal transformers are built around a ring shaped core which depending on operating frequency is made from a long strip of silicon steel or permalloy wound into a coil powdered iron or ferrite 70 a strip construction ensures that the grain boundaries are optimally aligned improving the transformer s efficiency by reducing the core s reluctance the closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an e i core 43 the cross section of the ring is usually square or rectangular but more expensive cores with circular cross sections are also available the primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core this minimizes the length of wire needed and also provides screening to minimize the core s magnetic field from generating electromagnetic interference toroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated e i types for a similar power level other advantages compared to e i types include smaller size about half lower weight about half less mechanical hum making them superior in audio amplifiers lower exterior magnetic field about one tenth low off load losses making them more efficient in standby circuits single bolt mounting and greater choice of shapes the main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity see classification parameters below because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current compared to laminated e i types ferrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz to reduce losses physical size and weight of inductive components a drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding this is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil as a consequence toroidal transformers rated more than a few kva are uncommon small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings edit air cores a physical core is not an absolute requisite and a functioning transformer can be produced simply by placing the windings near each other an arrangement termed an air core transformer the air which comprises the magnetic circuit is essentially lossless and so an air core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material 40 the leakage inductance is inevitably high resulting in very poor regulation and so such designs are unsuitable for use in power distribution 40 they have however very high bandwidth and are frequently employed in radio frequency applications 71 for which a satisfactory coupling coefficient is maintained by carefully overlapping the primary and secondary windings they re also used for resonant transformers such as tesla coils where they can achieve reasonably low loss in spite of the high leakage inductance edit windings windings are usually arranged concentrically to minimize flux leakage the conducting material used for the windings depends upon the application but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn 72 for small power and signal transformers in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small the coils are often wound from enamelled magnet wire such as formvar wire larger power transformers operating at high voltages may be wound with copper rectangular strip conductors insulated by oil impregnated paper and blocks of pressboard 73 cut view through transformer windings white insulator green spiral grain oriented silicon steel black primary winding made of oxygen free copper red secondary winding top left toroidal transformer right c core but e core would be similar the black windings are made of film top equally low capacitance between all ends of both windings since most cores are at least moderately conductive they also need insulation bottom lowest capacitance for one end of the secondary winding needed for low power high voltage transformers bottom left reduction of leakage inductance would lead to increase of capacitance high frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided litz wire to minimize the skin effect and proximity effect losses 47 large power transformers use multiple stranded conductors as well since even at low power frequencies non uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high current windings 73 each strand is individually insulated and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding or throughout the whole winding each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor the transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself the stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size aiding manufacture 73 the windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high frequency response coils are split into sections and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding power frequency transformers may have taps at intermediate points on the winding usually on the higher voltage winding side for voltage adjustment taps may be manually recconnected or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps automatic on load tap changers are used in electric power transmission or distribution on equipment such as arc furnace transformers or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads audio frequency transformers used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker a center tapped transformer is often used in the output stage of an audio power amplifier in a push pull circuit modulation transformers in am transmitters are very similar dry type transformer winding insulation systems can be either of standard open wound dip and bake construction or of higher quality designs that include vacuum pressure impregnation vpi vacuum pressure encapsulation vpe and cast coil encapsulation processes 74 in the vpi process a combination of heat vacuum and pressure is used to thoroughly seal bind and eliminate entrained air voids in the winding polyester resin insulation coat layer thus increasing resistance to corona vpe windings are similar to vpi windings but provide more protection against environmental effects such as from water dirt or corrosive ambients by multiple dips including typically in terms of final epoxy coat 75 edit cooling cutaway view of liquid immersed construction transformer the conservator reservoir at top provides liquid to atmosphere isolation tank walls cooling fins provide required heat dissipation balance see also arrhenius equation small dry type and liquid immersed transformers are often self cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation as power ratings increase transformers are often cooled by forced air cooling forced oil cooling water cooling or combinations of these 76 most outdoor power rated transformers are filled with transformer oil a dielectric fluid that both cools and insulates the windings 77 transformer oil is a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank the mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years it is estimated that 50 of power transformers will survive 50 years of use that the average age of failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years and that about 30 of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures 78 79 the accepted rule of thumb is that transformer life expectancy is halved for every 8 160 c increase in operating temperature 80 prolonged operation at elevated temperature accordingly degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectic coolant which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure 80 with a great body of empirical study as a guide transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information and in the case of very large rated high value transfomer assets this often translates in a need to monitor model forecast and manage oil and winding conductor insulation temperature conditions under varying possibly difficult power loading conditions 81 82 building regulations in many jurisdictions require indoor liquid filled transformers to either use dielectric fluids that are less flammable than oil have spill collection systems or be installed in fire resistant rooms 83 air cooled dry transformers are thus preferred for indoor applications even where oil cooled construction would be more economical because their lower transformer cost would more than offset more stringent building construction requirements the tank of liquid immersed construction transformers usually has at minimum either radiators through which the dielectic coolant circulates by natural convection or cooling fins some large transformers employ electric fans for forced air cooling pumps for forced liquid cooling or have heat exchangers for water cooling 77 an oil immersed transformer may be equipped with a buchholz relay which depending on severity of gas accumulation due to internal arcing is used to either alarm or de energize the transformer 67 oil immersed transformer installations usually include fire protection measures such as walls oil containment and fire suppression sprinkler systems polychlorinated biphenyls have properties that once favored their use as a dielectic coolant though concerns over their environmental persistence led to a widespread ban on their use 84 today non toxic stable silicone based oils or fluorinated hydrocarbons may be used where the expense of a fire resistant liquid offsets additional building cost for a transformer vault 85 83 pcbs for new equipment was banned in 1981 and in 2000 for use in existing equipment in united kingdom 86 legislation was instituted in canada between 1977 and 1985 that essentially bans pcb use in transformers manufactured in or imported into the country after 1980 the maximum allowable level of pcb contamination in existing mineral oil transformers being 50 ppm 87 some transformers instead of being liquid filled have their windings enclosed in sealed pressurized tanks and cooled by nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride gas 85 experimental power transformers in the 500 to 1 000 kva range have been built with liquid nitrogen or helium cooled superconducting windings which compared to usual transformer losses eliminates winding losses without affecting core losses 88 89 edit insulation drying construction of oil filled transformers requires that the insulation covering the windings be thoroughly dried before the oil is introduced drying is carried out at the factory and may be required as a field service drying may be done by circulating hot air around the core or by vapour phase drying vpd where evaporated solvent transfers heat by condensation on the coil and core for small transformers resistance heating by injection of current into the windings is used the heating can be controlled very well and it is energy efficient the method is called low frequency heating lfh since the current is injected at a much lower frequency than the nominal of the grid which is normally 50 or 60 160 hz a lower frequency reduces the effect of the inductance in the transformer so the voltage needed to induce the current can be reduced 90 the lfh drying method is also used for service of older transformers 91 edit terminals very small transformers will have wire leads connected directly to the ends of the coils and brought out to the base of the unit for circuit connections larger transformers may have heavy bolted terminals bus bars or high voltage insulated bushings made of polymers or porcelain a large bushing can be a complex structure since it must provide careful control of the electric field gradient without letting the transformer leak oil 92 edit classification parameters transformers can be classified in many ways such as the following power capacity from a fraction of a volt ampere va to over a thousand mva duty of a transformer continuous short time intermittent periodic varying frequency range power frequency audio frequency or radio frequency voltage class from a few volts to hundreds of kilovolts cooling type dry and liquid immersed self cooled forced air cooled liquid immersed forced oil cooled water cooled circuit application such as power supply impedance matching output voltage and current stabilizer or circuit isolation utilization pulse power distribution rectifier arc furnace amplifier output etc basic magnetic form core form shell form constant potential transformer descriptor step up step down isolation general winding configuration by eic vector group various possible two winding combinations of the phase designations delta wye or star and zigzag or interconnected star b other autotransformer scott t zigzag grounding transformer winding 93 94 95 96 rectifier phase shift winding configuration 2 winding 6 pulse 3 winding 12 pulse n winding n 1 6 pulse polygon etc edit types for more details see transformer types or specific main articles as shown a wide variety of transformer designs are used for different applications though they share several common features important common transformer types include autotransformer transformer in which part of the winding is common to both primary and secondary circuits 97 capacitor voltage transformer transformer in which capacitor divider is used to reduce high voltage before application to the primary winding distribution transformer power transformer international standards make a distinction in terms of distribution transformers being used to distribute energy from transmission lines and networks for local consumption and power transformers being used to transfer electric energy between the generator and distribution primary circuits 97 98 c phase angle regulating transformer a specialised transformer used to control the flow of real power on three phase electricity transmission networks scott t transformer transformer used for phase transformation from three phase to two phase and vice versa 97 polyphase transformer any transformer with more than one phase zigzag or interconnected star transformer zigzag grounding transformer winding transformer used for grounding or phase shifting three phase circuits leakage tramsformer transformer that has loosely coupled windings resonant transformer transformer that uses resonance to generate a high secondary voltage audio transformer transformer used in audio equipment output transformer transformer used to match the output of a valve amplifer to its load instrument transformer potential or current transformer used to accurately and safely represent voltage current or phase position of high voltage or high power circuits 97 edit applications an electrical substation in melbourne australia showing 3 of 5 220kv 66kv transformers each with a capacity of 150 mva 99 transformer at the limestone generating station in manitoba canada transformers are used to increase voltage before transmitting electrical energy over long distances through wires wires have resistance which loses energy through joule heating at a rate corresponding to square of the current by transforming electrical power to a higher voltage for transmission and transformers enable economical transmission of power and distribution consequently transformers have shaped the electricity supply industry permitting generation to be located remotely from points of demand 100 all but a tiny fraction of the world s electrical power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer 56 transformers are also used extensively in electronic products to step down the supply voltage to a level suitable for the low voltage circuits they contain the transformer also electrically isolates the end user from contact with the supply voltage signal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of amplifiers and to match devices such as microphones and record players to the input of amplifiers audio transformers allowed telephone circuits to carry on a two way conversation over a single pair of wires a balun transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has balanced voltages to ground such as between external cables and internal circuits the principle of open circuit unloaded transformer is widely used for characterisation of soft magnetic materials for example in the internationally standardised epstein frame method 101 edit see also

fundamental noise frequency is two times that of the power frequency as there is an extension and a contraction of core laminations for every cycle of the ac wave and a transformer s audible hum noise level is dominated by the fundamental noise frequency and its first triplen harmonic i e by the 100 amp 300 hz or 120 amp 360 hz frequencies 55 for example the delta wye transformer by far the most common commercial three phase transformer is known as the dyn11 vector group configuration dyn11 denoting d for delta primary winding y for wye secondary winding n for neutral of the wye winding and 11 for relative phase position on the clock by which the secondary winding leads the primary winding namely 30 leading while the above formal definition derived from standards such as ieee c57 12 80 applies to large transformers it is not uncommon in colloquial or even trade parlance for small general purpose transformers to be referred to as power transformers for distribution transformers to be referred to as power distribution transformers and so on edit references knowlton a e ed 1949 standard handbook for electrical engineers 8th ed mcgraw hill p 160 597 fig 6 42 mack james e shoemaker
