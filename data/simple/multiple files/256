holap h ybrid o n l ine a nalytical p rocessing is a combination of rolap relational olap and molap multidimensional olap which are other possible implementations of olap holap allows storing part of the data in a molap store and another part of the data in a rolap store allowing a tradeoff of the advantages of each the degree of control that the cube designer has over this partitioning varies from product to product contents 1 vertical partitioning 2 horizontal partitioning 3 products 4 footnotes edit vertical partitioning in this mode holap stores aggregations in molap for fast query performance and detailed data in rolap to optimize time of cube processing edit horizontal partitioning in this mode holap stores some slice of data usually the more recent one i e sliced by time dimension in molap for fast query performance and older data in rolap moreover we can store some dices in molap and others in rolap leveraging the fact that in a large cuboid there will be dense and sparse subregions 1 edit products the first product to provide holap storage was holos but the technology also became available in other commercial products such as microsoft analysis services oracle database olap option microstrategy and sap ag bi accelerator the hybrid olap approach combines rolap and molap technology benefiting from the greater scalability of rolap and the faster computation of molap for example a holap server may allow large volumes of detail data to be stored in a relational database while aggregations are kept in a separate molap store the microsoft sql server 7 0 olap services supports a hybrid olap server edit footnotes owen kaser and daniel lemire attribute value reordering for efficient hybrid olap information sciences volume 176 issue 16 pages 2279 2438 2006 v t e data warehouse 160 creating the data warehouse concepts database dimension dimensional modeling fact olap star schema aggregate variants anchor modeling column oriented dbms data vault modeling holap molap rolap operational data store elements data dictionary metadata data mart sixth normal form surrogate key fact fact table early arriving fact measure dimension dimension table degenerate slowly changing filling extract transform load etl extract transform load 160 using the data warehouse concepts business intelligence dashboard data mining decision support system dss olap cube languages data mining extensions dmx multidimensional expressions mdx xml for analysis xmla tools business intelligence tools reporting software spreadsheet 160 related people bill inmon ralph kimball products comparison of olap servers data warehousing products and their producers
