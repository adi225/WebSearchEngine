accuracy redirects here for the song by the cure see three imaginary boys accuracy indicates proximity of measurement results to the true value precision to the repeatability or reproducibility of the measurement in the fields of science engineering industry and statistics the accuracy 1 of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantity s actual true value the precision 1 of a measurement system also called reproducibility or repeatability is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results 2 although the two words reproducibility and repeatability can be synonymous in colloquial use they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method a measurement system can be accurate but not precise precise but not accurate neither or both for example if an experiment contains a systematic error then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy the result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experiment eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision a measurement system is designated valid if it is both accurate and precise related terms include bias non random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable and error random variability the terminology is also applied to indirect measurements that is values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data in addition to accuracy and precision measurements may also have a measurement resolution which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement in the case of full reproducibility such as when rounding a number to a representable floating point number the word precision has a meaning not related to reproducibility for example in the ieee 754 2008 standard it means the number of bits in the significand so it is used as a measure for the relative accuracy with which an arbitrary number can be represented contents 1 accuracy versus precision the target analogy 2 quantification 3 in binary classification 4 in psychometrics and psychophysics 5 in logic simulation 6 in information systems 7 see also 8 references 9 external links edit accuracy versus precision the target analogy high accuracy but low precision high precision but low accuracy accuracy is the degree of veracity while in some contexts precision may mean the degree of reproducibility citation needed the analogy used here to explain the difference between accuracy and precision is the target comparison in this analogy repeated measurements are compared to arrows that are shot at a target accuracy describes the closeness of arrows to the bullseye at the target center arrows that strike closer to the bullseye are considered more accurate the closer a system s measurements are to the accepted value the more accurate the system is considered to be to continue the analogy if a large number of arrows are shot precision would be the size of the arrow cluster when only one arrow is shot precision is the size of the cluster one would expect if this were repeated many times under the same conditions when all arrows are grouped tightly together the cluster is considered precise since they all struck close to the same spot even if not necessarily near the bullseye the measurements are precise though not necessarily accurate however it is not possible to reliably achieve accuracy in individual measurements without precision if the arrows are not grouped close to one another they cannot all be close to the bullseye their average position might be an accurate estimation of the bullseye but the individual arrows are inaccurate see also circular error probable for application of precision to the science of ballistics edit quantification see also false precision ideally a measurement device is both accurate and precise with measurements all close to and tightly clustered around the known value the accuracy and precision of a measurement process is usually established by repeatedly measuring some traceable reference standard such standards are defined in the international system of units abbreviated si from french syst me international d unit s and maintained by national standards organizations such as the national institute of standards and technology in the united states this also applies when measurements are repeated and averaged in that case the term standard error is properly applied the precision of the average is equal to the known standard deviation of the process divided by the square root of the number of measurements averaged further the central limit theorem shows that the probability distribution of the averaged measurements will be closer to a normal distribution than that of individual measurements with regard to accuracy we can distinguish the difference between the mean of the measurements and the reference value the bias establishing and correcting for bias is necessary for calibration the combined effect of that and precision a common convention in science and engineering is to express accuracy and or precision implicitly by means of significant figures here when not explicitly stated the margin of error is understood to be one half the value of the last significant place for instance a recording of 843 6 160 m or 843 0 160 m or 800 0 160 m would imply a margin of 0 05 160 m the last significant place is the tenths place while a recording of 8 436 160 m would imply a margin of error of 0 5 160 m the last significant digits are the units a reading of 8 000 160 m with trailing zeroes and no decimal point is ambiguous the trailing zeroes may or may not be intended as significant figures to avoid this ambiguity the number could be represented in scientific notation 8 0 160 160 10 3 160 m indicates that the first zero is significant hence a margin of 50 160 m while 8 000 160 160 10 3 160 m indicates that all three zeroes are significant giving a margin of 0 5 160 m similarly it is possible to use a multiple of the basic measurement unit 8 0 160 km is equivalent to 8 0 160 160 10 3 160 m in fact it indicates a margin of 0 05 160 km 50 160 m however reliance on this convention can lead to false precision errors when accepting data from sources that do not obey it precision is sometimes stratified into repeatability the variation arising when all efforts are made to keep conditions constant by using the same instrument and operator and repeating during a short time period and reproducibility the variation arising using the same measurement process among different instruments and operators and over longer time periods edit in binary classification accuracy is also used as a statistical measure of how well a binary classification test correctly identifies or excludes a condition condition as determined by gold standard true false test outcome positive true positive false positive positive predictive value or precision negative false negative true negative negative predictive value sensitivity or recall specificity or its complement fall out accuracy that is the accuracy is the proportion of true results both true positives and true negatives in the population it is a parameter of the test on the other hand precision or positive predictive value is defined as the proportion of the true positives against all the positive results both true positives and false positives an accuracy of 100 means that the measured values are exactly the same as the given values also see sensitivity and specificity accuracy may be determined from sensitivity and specificity provided prevalence is known using the equation the accuracy paradox for predictive analytics states that predictive models with a given level of accuracy may have greater predictive power than models with higher accuracy it may be better to avoid the accuracy metric in favor of other metrics such as precision and recall citation needed in situations where the minority class is more important f measure may be more appropriate especially in situations with very skewed class imbalance another useful performance measure is the balanced accuracy which avoids inflated performance estimates on imbalanced datasets it is defined as the arithmetic mean of sensitivity and specificity or the average accuracy obtained on either class if the classifier performs equally well on either class this term reduces to the conventional accuracy i e the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions in contrast if the conventional accuracy is above chance only because the classifier takes advantage of an imbalanced test set then the balanced accuracy as appropriate will drop to chance 3 a closely related chance corrected measure is 4 while a direct approach to debiasing and renormalizing accuracy is cohen s kappa whilst informedness has been shown to be a kappa family debiased renormalization of recall 5 informedness and kappa have the advantage that chance level is defined to be 0 and they have the form of a probability informedness has the stronger property that it is the probability that an informed decision is made rather than a guess when positive when negative this is still true for the absolutely value of informedness but the information has been used to force an incorrect response 4 edit in psychometrics and psychophysics in psychometrics and psychophysics the term accuracy is interchangeably used with validity and constant error precision is a synonym for reliability and variable error the validity of a measurement instrument or psychological test is established through experiment or correlation with behavior reliability is established with a variety of statistical techniques classically through an internal consistency test like cronbach s alpha to ensure sets of related questions have related responses and then comparison of those related question between reference and target population citation needed edit in logic simulation in logic simulation a common mistake in evaluation of accurate models is to compare a logic simulation model to a transistor circuit simulation model this is a comparison of differences in precision not accuracy precision is measured with respect to detail and accuracy is measured with respect to reality 6 7 edit in information systems the concepts of accuracy and precision have also been studied in the context of data bases information systems and their sociotechnical context the necessary extension of these two concepts on the basis of theory of science suggests that they as well as data quality and information quality should be centered on accuracy defined as the closeness to the true value seen as the degree of agreement of readings or of calculated values of one same
