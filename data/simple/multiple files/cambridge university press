university press is both the oldest publishing house in the world and the oldest university press it originated from letters patent similar to a royal charter granted to the university of cambridge by henry viii in 1534 and has been producing books continuously since the first university press book was printed in 1584 cambridge is one of the two privileged presses the other being oxford university press authors published by cambridge have included john milton william harvey isaac newton bertrand russell and stephen hawking 12 the edinburgh building on the main site of the press university printing did not actually begin in cambridge until the first practising university printer thomas thomas had been appointed in 1583 nearly fifty years after the grant of the letters patent he set up a printing house on the site of what became the senate house lawn a few yards from where the press s bookshop now stands in those days the stationers company in london jealously guarded its monopoly of printing which partly explains the delay between the date of the university s letters patent and the printing of the first book in 1591 thomas s successor john legate printed the first cambridge bible an octavo edition of the popular geneva bible the london stationers objected strenuously claiming that they had the monopoly on bible printing the university s response was to point out the provision in its charter to print all manner of books thus began the press s tradition of publishing the bible a tradition that has endured for over four centuries beginning with the geneva bible and continuing with the authorized version the revised version the new english bible and the revised english bible the restrictions and compromises forced upon cambridge by the dispute with the london stationers did not really come to an end until the scholar richard bentley was given the power to set up a new style press in 1696 it was in bentley s time in 1698 that a body of senior scholars the curators known from 1733 as the syndics was appointed to be responsible to the university for the press s affairs the press syndicate s publishing committee still meets regularly eighteen times a year and its role still includes the review and approval of the press s planned output john baskerville became university printer in the mid eighteenth century baskerville s concern was the production of the finest possible books using his own type design and printing techniques the university printing house on the main site of the press baskerville wrote the importance of the work demands all my attention not only for my own eternal reputation but i hope also to convince the world that the university in the honour done me has not entirely misplaced their favours caxton would have found nothing to surprise him if he had walked into the press s printing house in the eighteenth century all the type was still being set by hand wooden presses capable of producing only 1 000 sheets a day at best were still in use and books were still being individually bound by hand a technological breakthrough was badly needed and it came when lord stanhope perfected the making of stereotype plates this involved making a mould of the whole surface of a page of type and then casting plates from that mould the press was the first to use this technique and in 1805 produced the technically successful and much reprinted cambridge stereotype bible the letters patent of cambridge university press by henry viii allow the press to print all manner of books the fine initial with the king s portrait inside it and the large first line of script are still discernible by the 1850s the press was using steam powered machine presses employing two to three hundred people and occupying several buildings in the silver street and mill lane area including the one that the press still occupies the pitt building 1833 which was built specifically for the press and in honour of william pitt the younger under the stewardship of c j clay who was university printer from 1854 to 1882 the press increased the size and scale of its academic and educational publishing operation an important factor in this increase was the inauguration of its list of schoolbooks including what came to be known as the pitt press series during clay s administration the press also undertook a sizable co publishing venture with oxford the revised version of the bible which was begun in 1870 and completed in 1885 it was in this period as well that the syndics of the press turned down what later became the oxford english dictionary a proposal for which was brought to cambridge by james murray lexicographer before he turned to oxford the appointment of r t wright as secretary of the press syndicate in 1892 marked the beginning of the press s development as a modern publishing business with a clearly defined editorial policy and administrative structure it was wright with two great historians lord acton and f w maitland who devised the plan for one of the most distinctive cambridge contributions to publishing the cambridge histories the cambridge modern history was published between 1902 and 1912 nine years later the press issued the first volumes of the freshly edited complete works of shakespeare a project of nearly equal scope that was not finished until 1966 the press s list in science and mathematics began to thrive with men of the stature of albert einstein and ernest rutherford subsequently becoming press authors the press s impressive contribution to journal publishing began in 1893 and today it publishes over 300 journals in 1992 the press opened its own bookshop at 1 trinity street in the centre of cambridge books have been sold continuously on this site since at least 1581 perhaps even as early as 1505

s decision to destroy all remaining copies of its 2006 book alms for jihad charity and terrorism in the islamic world by burr and collins as part of the settlement of a lawsuit brought by saudi billionaire khalid bin mahfouz 14 within hours alms for jihad became one of the 100 most sought after titles on amazon com and ebay in the united states cup sent a letter to libraries asking them to remove copies from circulation cup subsequently sent out copies of an errata sheet for the book the american library association issued a recommendation to libraries still holding alms for jihad given the intense interest in the book and the desire of readers to learn about the controversy first hand we recommend that u s libraries keep the book available for their users the publisher s decision did not have the support of the book s authors and was criticised by some who claimed it was incompatible with freedom of speech and with freedom of the press and that it indicated that english libel laws were excessively strict 15 16 in a new york times book review 7 october 2007 united states congressman frank r wolf described cambridge s settlement as basically a book burning 17 cup pointed out that at that time it had already sold most of its copies of the book cambridge defended its actions saying it had acted responsibly and that it is a global publisher with a duty to observe the laws of many different countries 18 edit cambridge university press et al v patton et al main article cambridge university press v patton in 2008 cambridge university press oxford university press and sage publications sued four senior members of staff employed by georgia state university over the university s electronic reserves policy which is an online version of the usual reserve policy for texts used in courses at gsu professors could request that the library scan significant extracts of books and make them available for students in particular classes as part of e coursepacks which the publishers claim went far beyond the fair use provisions of copyright law 19 edit community work the press has been recognised on several occasions for its commitment to community involvement and social responsibility and it has stated that public engagement is an important part of the press s role by undertaking educational projects and fundraising 20 in 2009 the press s chief executive at
