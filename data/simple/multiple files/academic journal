an academic journal is a peer reviewed periodical in which scholarship relating to a particular academic discipline is published academic journals serve as forums for the introduction and presentation for scrutiny of new research and the critique of existing research content typically takes the form of articles presenting original research review articles and book reviews the term academic journal applies to scholarly publications in all fields this article discusses the aspects common to all academic field journals scientific journals and journals of the quantitative social sciences vary in form and function from journals of the humanities and qualitative social sciences their specific aspects are separately discussed contents 1 scholarly articles 2 reviewing 2 1 review articles 2 2 book

academia solicited where an individual has been invited to submit work either through direct contact or through a general submissions call and unsolicited where an individual submits a work for potential publication without directly being asked to do so 1 upon receipt of a submitted article editors at the journal determine whether to reject the submission outright or begin the process of peer review in the latter case the submission becomes subject to review by outside scholars of the editor s choosing who typically remain anonymous the number of these peer reviewers or referees varies according to each journal s editorial practice typically no fewer than two though sometimes three or more experts in the subject matter of the article produce reports upon the content style and other factors which inform the editors publication decisions though these reports are generally confidential some journals and publishers also practice public peer review the editors either choose to reject the article ask for a revision and resubmission or accept the article for publication even accepted articles are often subjected to further sometimes considerable editing by journal editorial staff before they appear in print the peer review can take from several weeks to several months 2 edit reviewing edit review articles review articles also called reviews of progress are checks on the research published in journals some journals are devoted entirely to review articles others contain a few in each issue but most do not publish review articles such reviews often cover the research from the preceding year some for longer or shorter terms some are devoted to specific topics some to general surveys some journals are enumerative listing all significant articles in a given subject others are selective including only what they think worthwhile yet others are evaluative judging the state of progress in the subject field some journals are published in series each covering a complete subject field year or covering specific fields through several years unlike original research articles review articles tend to be solicited submissions sometimes planned years in advance they are typically relied upon by students beginning a study in a given field or for current awareness of those already in the field 3 edit book reviews book reviews of scholarly books are checks upon the research books published by scholars unlike articles book reviews tend to be solicited journals typically have a separate book review editor determining which new books to review and by whom if an outside scholar accepts the book review editor s request for a book review he or she generally receives a free copy of the book from the journal in exchange for a timely review publishers send books to book review editors in the hope that their books will be reviewed the length and depth of research book reviews varies much from journal to journal as does the extent of textbook and trade book review 4 edit prestige different types of peer reviewed research journals these specific publications are about economics an academic journal s prestige is established over time and can reflect many factors some but not all of which are expressible quantitatively in each academic discipline there are dominant journals that receive the largest number of submissions and therefore can be selective in choosing their content yet not only the largest journals are of excellent quality 5 edit ranking in the natural sciences and in the hard social sciences the impact factor is a convenient proxy measuring the number of later articles citing articles already published in the journal there are other possible quantitative factors such as the overall number of citations how quickly articles are cited and the average half life of articles i e when they are no longer cited there also is the question of whether or not any quantitative factor can reflect true prestige natural science journals are categorized and ranked in the science citation index social science journals in the social sciences citation index 5 in the anglo american humanities there is no tradition as there is in the sciences of giving impact factors that could be used in establishing a journal s prestige recent moves have been made by the european science foundation to rectify the situation resulting in the publication of preliminary lists for the ranking of academic journals in the humanities 5 in some disciplines such as knowledge management intellectual capital the lack of a well established journal ranking system is perceived as a major obstacle on the way to tenure promotion and achievement recognition 6 the categorization of journal prestige in some subjects has been attempted typically using letters to rank their academic world importance we can distinguish three categories of techniques to assess journal quality and develop journal rankings 7 stated preference revealed preference and publication power approaches 8 edit publishing many academic journals are subsidized by universities or professional organizations and do not exist to make a profit however they often accept advertising page and image charges from authors to pay for production costs on the other hand some journals are produced by commercial publishers who do make a profit by charging subscriptions to individuals and libraries they may also sell all of their journals in discipline specific collections or a variety of other packages 9 journal editors tend to have other professional responsibilities most often as teaching professors in the case of the largest journals there are paid staff assisting in the editing the production of the journals is almost always done by publisher paid staff humanities and social science academic journals are usually subsidized by universities or professional organization 10 edit new developments the internet has revolutionized the production of and access to academic journals with their contents available online via services subscribed to by academic libraries individual articles are subject indexed in databases such as google scholar some of the smallest most specialized journals are prepared in house by an academic department and published only online such form of publication has sometimes been in the blog format currently there is a movement in higher education encouraging open access either via self archiving whereby the author deposits a paper in a repository where it can be searched for and read or via publishing it in a free open access journal which does not charge for subscriptions being either subsidized or financed with author page charges however to date open access has affected science journals more than humanities journals commercial publishers are now experimenting with open access models but are trying to protect their subscription revenues 11 edit see also academic authorship academic library academic
