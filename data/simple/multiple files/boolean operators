this article is about connectives in logical systems for connectors in natural languages see discourse connective for other logical symbols see table of logic symbols in logic a logical connective also called a logical operator is a symbol or word used to connect two or more sentences of either a formal or a natural language in a grammatically valid way such that the sense of the compound sentence produced depends only on the original sentences the most common logical connectives are binary connectives also called dyadic connectives which join two sentences which can be thought of as the function s operands also commonly negation is considered to be a unary connective logical connectives along with quantifiers are the two main types of logical constants used in formal systems such as propositional logic and predicate logic semantics of a logical connective is often but not always presented as a truth function contents 1 in language 1 1 natural language 1 2 formal languages 2

sentence some but not all such grammatical conjunctions are truth functions for example consider the following sentences a jack went up the hill b jill went up the hill c jack went up the hill and jill went up the hill d jack went up the hill so jill went up the hill the words and and so are grammatical conjunctions joining the sentences a and b to form the compound sentences c and d the and in c is a logical connective since the truth of c is completely determined by a and b it would make no sense to affirm a and b but deny c however so in d is not a logical connective since it would be quite reasonable to affirm a and b but deny d perhaps after all jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water not because jack had gone up the hill at all various english words and word pairs express logical connectives and some of them are synonymous examples with the name of the relationship in parentheses are and conjunction or disjunction either or exclusive disjunction implies implication if then implication if and only if equivalence only if implication just in case equivalence but conjunction however conjunction not both nand neither nor nor the word not negation and the phrases it is false that negation and it is not the case that negation also express a logical connective even though they are applied to a single statement and do not connect two statements edit formal languages in formal languages truth functions are represented by unambiguous symbols these symbols are called logical connectives logical operators propositional operators or in classical logic truth functional connectives see well formed formula for the rules which allow new well formed formulas to be constructed by joining other well formed formulas using truth functional connectives logical connectives

names for biconditional are iff xnor and bi implication for example the meaning of the statements it is raining and i am indoors is transformed when the two are combined with logical connectives it is raining and i am indoors p q if it is raining then i am indoors p q if i am indoors then it is raining q p i am indoors if and only if it is raining p q it is not raining p for statement p it is raining and q i am indoors it is also common to consider the always true formula and the always false formula to be connective true formula 1 v pq or t false formula 0 o pq or f edit history of notations negation the symbol appeared in heyting in 1929 1 2 compare to frege s symbol in his begriffsschrift the symbol appeared in russell in 1908 3 an alternative notation is to add an horizontal line on top of the formula as in another alternative notation is to use a prime symbol as in p conjunction the symbol appeared in heyting in 1929 1 compare to peano s use of the set theoretic notation of intersection 4 amp appeared at least in sch nfinkel in 1924 5 comes from boole s interpretation of logic as an elementary algebra disjunction the symbol appeared in russell in 1908 3 compare to peano s use of the set theoretic notation of union the symbol is also used in spite of the ambiguity coming from the fact that the of ordinary elementary algebra is an exclusive or when interpreted logically in a two element ring punctually in the history a together with a dot in the lower right corner has been used by peirce 6 implication the symbol can be seen in hilbert in 1917 7 was used by russell in 1908 3 compare to peano s inverted c notation was used in vax 8 biconditional the symbol was used at least by russell in 1908 3 was used at least by tarski in 1940 9 was used in vax other symbols appeared punctually in the history such as in gentzen 10 in sch nfinkel 5 or in chazal 11 true the symbol 1 comes from boole s interpretation of logic as an elementary algebra over the two element boolean algebra other notations include to be found in peano false the symbol 0 comes also from boole s interpretation of logic as a ring other notations include to be found in peano some authors used letters for connectives at some time of the history u for conjunction german s und for and and o for disjunction german s oder for or in earlier works by hilbert 1904 n p for negation k pq for conjunction a pq for disjunction c pq for implication e pq for biconditional in ukasiewicz 1929 12 edit redundancy such logical connective as converse implication 160 is actually the same as material conditional with swapped arguments so the symbol for converse implication is redundant in some logical calculi notably in classical logic certain essentially different compound statements are logically equivalent less trivial example of a redundancy is a classical equivalence between p q and p q therefore a classical based logical system does not need the conditional operator if not and or are already in use or may use the only as a syntactic sugar for a compound having one negation and one disjunction there are sixteen boolean functions associating the input truth values p and q with four digit binary outputs these correspond to possible choices of binary logical connectives for classical logic different implementation of classical logic can choose different functionally complete subsets of connectives one approach is to choose a minimal set and define other connectives by some logical form like in the example with material conditional above the following are the minimal functionally complete sets of operators in classical logic whose arities do not exceed 2 one element two elements 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 160 three elements see more details about functional completeness in classical logic at truth function functional completeness another approach is to use on equal rights connectives of a certain convenient and functionally complete but not minimal set this approach requires more propositional axioms and each equivalence between logical forms must be either an axiom or provable as a theorem but intuitionistic logic has the situation more complicated of its five connectives only negation 160 has to be reduced to other connectives see details neither of conjunction disjunction and material conditional has an equivalent form constructed of other four logical connectives edit properties some logical connectives possess properties which may be expressed in the theorems containing the connective some of those properties that a logical connective may have are associativity within an expression containing two or more of the same associative connectives in a row the order of the operations does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed commutativity the operands of the connective may be swapped preserving logical equivalence to the original expression distributivity a connective denoted by distributes over another connective denoted by if a b c a b a c for all operands a b c idempotence whenever the operands of the operation are the same the compound is logically equivalent to the operand absorption a pair of connectives satisfies the absorption law if for all operands a b monotonicity if f a 1 a n f b 1 b n for all a 1 a n b 1 b n 0 1 such that a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a n b n e g affinity each variable always makes a difference in the truth value of the operation or it never makes a difference e g duality to read the truth value assignments for the operation from top to bottom on its truth table is the same as taking the complement of reading the table of the same or another connective from bottom to top without resorting to truth tables it may be formulated as g a 1 a n g a 1 a n e g truth preserving the compound all those argument are tautologies is a tautology itself e g see validity falsehood preserving the compound all those argument are contradictions is a contradiction itself e g see validity involutivity for unary connectives f f a a e g negation in classical logic for classical and intuitionistic logic the symbol means that corresponding implications and for logical compounds can be both proved as theorems and the symbol means that for logical compounds is a consequence of corresponding connectives for propositional variables some of many valued logics may have incompatible definitions of equivalence and order entailment both conjunction and disjunction are associative commutative and idempotent in classical logic most varieties of many valued logic and intuitionistic logic the same is true about distributivity of conjunction over disjunction and disjunction over conjunction as well as for the absorption law in classical logic and some varieties of many valued logic conjunction and disjunction are dual and negation is self dual the latter is also self dual in intuitionistic logic this section requires expansion march 2012 edit order of precedence as a way of reducing the number of necessary parentheses one may introduce precedence rules has higher precedence than higher than and higher than so for example p q r s is short for p q r s here is a table that shows a commonly used precedence of logical operators operator precedence 1 2 3 4 5 the order of precedence determines which connective is the main connective when interpreting a non atomic formula edit computer science truth functional approach to logical operators is implemented as logic gates in digital circuits practically all digital circuits the major exception is dram are built up from nand nor not and transmission gates see more details in truth function computer science logical operators over bit vectors corresponding to finite boolean algebras are bitwise operations but not any usage of a logical connective in programming has a boolean semantic for example lazy evaluation is sometimes implemented for p q and p q so these connectives are not commutative if some of expressions p q has side effects also a conditional which in some sense corresponds to the material conditional connective is essentially non boolean because for if p then q the consequent 160 q is not executed if the antecedent 160 p is false although a compound as a whole is successful true in such case this is closer to intuitionist and constructivist views on the material conditional rather than to classical logic s ones this section requires expansion march 2012 edit see also boolean domain boolean
