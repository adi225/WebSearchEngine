the probabilistic relevance model 1 was devised by robertson and jones as a framework for probabilistic models to come it makes an estimation of the probability of finding if a document d j is relevant to a query q this model assumes that this probability of relevance depends on the query and document representations furthermore it assumes that there is a portion of all documents that is preferred by the user as the answer set for query q such an ideal answer set is called r and should maximize the overall probability of relevance to that user the prediction is that documents in this set r are relevant to the query while documents not present in the set are non relevant edit related models there are some limitations to this framework that need to be addressed by further development there is no accurate estimate for the first run probabilities index terms are not weighted terms are assumed mutually independent to address these and other concerns there are some developed models from the probabilistic relevance framework the binary independence model for one as it is from the same author the most known derivative of this framework is the okapi bm25 weighting scheme and it s bm25f brother edit references s e robertson k s jones may june 1976 relevance weighting of search terms journal of the american society for information science pp 160 129 146 http portal acm org citation cfm id 106783
