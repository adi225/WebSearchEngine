which a quantitative theory already exists it is often regarded as a subdiscipline of theoretical physics but some consider it an intermediate branch between theoretical and experimental physics it is a subset of computational science or scientific computing which covers all of science rather than just physics physicists often have a very precise mathematical theory describing how a system will behave unfortunately it is often the case that solving the theory s equations ab initio in order to produce a useful prediction is not practical this is especially true with quantum mechanics where only a handful of simple models admit closed form analytic solutions in cases where the equations can only be solved approximately computational methods are often used contents 1 applications of

modeling solid state physics and soft condensed matter physics computational solid state physics for example uses density functional theory to calculate properties of solids a method similar to that used by chemists to study molecules molecular dynamics which simulates the motion of interacting atoms and molecules is an important technique in materials science chemical physics and the modeling of biomolecules edit methods and algorithms as these topics are explored many more general numerical and mathematical problems are encountered in the process of calculating physical properties of the modeled systems these include but are not limited to solving differential equations evaluating integrals stochastic methods especially monte carlo methods specialized partial differential equation methods for example the finite difference method and the finite element method the matrix eigenvalue problem the problem of finding eigenvalues of very large matrices and their corresponding eigenvectors eigenstates in quantum physics the pseudo spectral method computational physics also encompasses the tuning of the software or hardware structure to solve problems approaches to solving the problems are often very demanding in terms of processing power and or memory requests edit see also important publications in computational physics computational magnetohydrodynamics division of
