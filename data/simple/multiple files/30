national laboratory outside chicago is the first science and engineering research national laboratory in the united states receiving this designation on july 1 1946 1 it is the largest national laboratory by size and scope in the midwest a multipurpose laboratory led since 2009 by director eric isaacs 2 argonne maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research energy storage and renewable energy environmental sustainability and national security it is managed for the united states department of energy by uchicago argonne llc which is composed of the university of chicago and jacobs engineering group inc 3 argonne is a part of the expanding illinois technology and research corridor the laboratory is located on 1 700 acres 6 9 160 km 2 in dupage county 25 miles 40 160 km southwest of chicago illinois on interstate 55 completely encircled by waterfall glen forest preserve when it was first established it was known as the university of chicago s metallurgical laboratory met lab and it was previously located within red gate woods early in its history the laboratory was part of the manhattan project which built the first atomic bomb argonne national laboratory had a smaller facility called argonne national laboratory west or simply argonne west in idaho next to the idaho national engineering and environmental laboratory in 2005 the two idaho based laboratories merged to become the idaho national laboratory 4 contents 1 overview 2 history 3 directors 4 initiatives 5 user facilities 6 educational and community outreach 7 argonne in modern media 8 notable

right argonne s third director stands next to the zero gradient synchrotron s cockcroft walton generator argonne traces its birth from enrico fermi s secret charge the manhattan project to create the world s first self sustaining nuclear reaction code named the metallurgical lab the team constructed chicago pile 1 which achieved criticality on december 2 1942 underneath the university of chicago s stagg football field stands because the experiments were deemed too dangerous to conduct in a major city the operations were moved to red gate woods in nearby palos hills and renamed argonne after the surrounding forest on july 1 1946 the laboratory was formally chartered as argonne national laboratory to conduct cooperative research in nucleonics at the request of the u s atomic energy commission it began developing nuclear reactors for the nation s peaceful nuclear energy program in the late 1940s and early 1950s the laboratory moved to a larger location in lemont illinois and established a remote location in idaho called argonne west to conduct further nuclear research in quick succession the laboratory designed and built chicago pile 3 the world s first heavy water moderated reactor and the experimental breeder reactor i built in idaho which lit a string of four light bulbs to produce the world s first nuclear generated electricity in 1951 a complete list of the reactors designed and in most cases built and operated by argonne can be viewed in the reactors designed by argonne page the knowledge gained from the argonne experiments conducted with these reactors 1 formed the foundation for the designs of most of the commercial reactors currently used throughout the world for electric power generation and 2 inform the current evolving designs of liquid metal reactors for future commercial power stations conducting classified research the laboratory was heavily secured all employees and visitors needed badges to pass a checkpoint many of the buildings were classified and the laboratory itself was fenced and guarded such alluring secrecy drew visitors both authorized including king leopold iii of belgium and queen frederica of greece 8 and unauthorized shortly past 1 a m on february 6 1951 argonne guards discovered reporter paul harvey near the 10 foot 3 0 160 m perimeter fence his coat tangled in the barbed wire searching his car guards found a previously prepared four page broadcast detailing the saga of his unauthorized entrance into a classified hot zone he was brought before a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obtain information on national security and transmit it to the public but was not indicted 9 not all nuclear technology went into developing reactors however while designing a scanner for reactor fuel elements in 1957 argonne physicist william nelson beck put his own arm inside the scanner and obtained one of the first ultrasound images of the human body 10 remote manipulators designed to handle radioactive materials laid the groundwork for more complex machines used to clean up contaminated areas sealed laboratories or caves 11 in 1964 the janus reactor opened to study the effects of neutron radiation on biological life providing research for guidelines on safe exposure levels for workers at power plants laboratories and hospitals 12 scientists at argonne pioneered a technique to analyze the moon s surface using alpha radiation which launched aboard the surveyor 5 13 in 1967 and later analyzed lunar samples from the apollo 11 mission in addition to nuclear work the laboratory maintained a strong presence in the basic research of physics and chemistry in 1955 argonne chemists co discovered the elements einsteinium and fermium elements 99 and 100 in the periodic table 14 in 1962 laboratory chemists produced the first compound of the inert noble gas xenon opening up a new field of chemical bonding research 15 in 1963 they discovered the hydrated electron 16 high energy physics made a leap forward when argonne was chosen as the site of the 12 5 gev zero gradient synchrotron a proton accelerator that opened in 1963 a bubble chamber allowed scientists to track the motions of subatomic particles as they zipped through the chamber in 1970 they observed the neutrino in a hydrogen bubble chamber for the first time 17 meanwhile the laboratory was also helping to design the reactor for the world s first nuclear powered submarine the u s s nautilus which steamed for more than 513 550 nautical miles 951 090 160 km the next nuclear reactor model was experimental boiling water reactor the forerunner of many modern nuclear plants and experimental breeder reactor ii ebr ii which was sodium cooled and included a fuel recycling facility ebr ii was later modified to test other reactor designs including a fast neutron reactor and in 1982 the integral fast reactor concept a revolutionary design that reprocessed its own fuel reduced its atomic waste and withstood safety tests of the same failures that triggered the chernobyl and three mile island disasters 18 in 1994 however the u s congress terminated funding for the bulk of argonne s nuclear programs argonne moved to specialize in other areas while capitalizing on its experience in physics chemical sciences and metallurgy in 1987 the laboratory was the first to successfully demonstrate a pioneering technique called plasma wakefield acceleration which accelerates particles in much shorter distances than conventional accelerators 19 it also cultivated a strong battery research program following a major push by then director alan schriesheim the laboratory was chosen as the site of the advanced photon source a major x ray facility which was completed in 1995 and produced the brightest x rays in the world at the time of its construction edit directors over the course of its history 11 eminent scientists have served as argonne director 1946 1956 walter zinn 1957 1961 norman hilberry 1961 1967 albert v
