not to be confused with secure virtual machine in machine learning support vector machines svms also support vector networks 1 are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns used for classification and regression analysis the basic svm takes a set of input data and predicts for each given input which of two possible classes forms the output making it a non probabilistic binary linear classifier given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other an svm model is a representation of the examples as points in space mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible new examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on in addition to performing linear classification svms can efficiently perform non linear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into high dimensional feature spaces contents 1 formal

bibliography edit formal definition more formally a support vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high or infinite dimensional space which can be used for classification regression or other tasks intuitively a good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training data point of any class so called functional margin since in general the larger the margin the lower the generalization error of the classifier whereas the original problem may be stated in a finite dimensional space it often happens that the sets to discriminate are not linearly separable in that space for this reason it was proposed that the original finite dimensional space be mapped into a much higher dimensional space presumably making the separation easier in that space to keep the computational load reasonable the mappings used by svm schemes are designed to ensure that dot products may be computed easily in terms of the variables in the original space by defining them in terms of a kernel function selected to suit the problem 2 the hyperplanes in the higher dimensional space are defined as the set of points whose dot product with a vector in that space is constant the vectors defining the hyperplanes can be chosen to be linear combinations with parameters of images of feature vectors that occur in the data base with this choice of a hyperplane the points in the feature space that are mapped into the hyperplane are defined by the relation note that if becomes small as grows further away from each element in the sum measures the degree of closeness of the test point to the corresponding data base point in this way the sum of kernels above can be used to measure the relative nearness of each test point to the data points originating in one or the other of the sets to be discriminated note the fact that the set of points mapped into any hyperplane can be quite convoluted as a result allowing much more complex discrimination between sets which are not convex at all in the original space edit history the original svm algorithm was invented by vladimir n vapnik and the current standard incarnation soft margin was proposed by vapnik and corinna cortes in 1995 1 edit motivation h 1 does not separate the classes h 2 does but only with a small margin h 3 separates them with the maximum margin classifying data is a common task in machine learning suppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes and the goal is to decide which class a new data point will be in in the case of support vector machines a data point is viewed as a p dimensional vector a list of p numbers and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a p 160 160 1 dimensional hyperplane this is called a linear classifier there are many hyperplanes that might classify the data one reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation or margin between the two classes so we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized if such a hyperplane exists it is known as the maximum margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum margin classifier or equivalently the perceptron of optimal stability edit linear svm given some training data a set of n points of the form where the y i is either 1 or 1 indicating the class to which the point belongs each is a p dimensional real vector we want to find the maximum margin hyperplane that divides the points having from those having any hyperplane can be written as the set of points satisfying maximum margin hyperplane and margins for an svm trained with samples from two classes samples on the margin are called the support vectors where denotes the dot product and the normal vector to the hyperplane the parameter determines the offset of the hyperplane from the origin along the normal vector if the training data are linearly separable we can select two hyperplanes in a way that they separate the data and there are no points between them and then try to maximize their distance the region bounded by them is called the margin these hyperplanes can be described by the equations and by using geometry we find the distance between these two hyperplanes is so we want to minimize as we also have to prevent data points from falling into the margin we add the following constraint for each either of the first class or of the second this can be rewritten as we can put this together to get the optimization problem minimize in subject to for any edit primal form the optimization problem presented in the preceding section is difficult to solve because it depends on w the norm of w which involves a square root fortunately it is possible to alter the equation by substituting w with the factor of 1 2 being used for mathematical convenience without changing the solution the minimum of the original and the modified equation have the same w and b this is a quadratic programming optimization problem more clearly minimize in subject to for any by introducing lagrange multipliers the previous constrained problem can be expressed as that is we look for a saddle point in doing so all the points which can be separated as do not matter since we must set the corresponding to zero this problem can now be solved by standard quadratic programming techniques and programs the stationary karush kuhn tucker condition implies that the solution can be expressed as a linear combination of the training vectors only a few will be greater than zero the corresponding are exactly the support vectors which lie on the margin and satisfy from this one can derive that the support vectors also satisfy which allows one to define the offset in practice it is more robust to average over all support vectors edit dual form writing the classification rule in its unconstrained dual form reveals that the maximum margin hyperplane and therefore the classification task is only a function of the support vectors the training data that lie on the margin using the fact that and substituting one can show that the dual of the svm reduces to the following optimization problem maximize in subject to for any and to the constraint from the minimization in here the kernel is defined by can be computed thanks to the terms edit biased and unbiased hyperplanes for simplicity reasons sometimes it is required that the hyperplane pass through the origin of the coordinate system such hyperplanes are called unbiased whereas general hyperplanes not necessarily passing through the origin are called biased an unbiased hyperplane can be enforced by setting in the primal optimization problem the corresponding dual is identical to the dual given above without the equality constraint edit soft margin in 1995 corinna cortes and vladimir n vapnik suggested a modified maximum margin idea that allows for mislabeled examples 1 if there exists no hyperplane that can split the yes and no examples the soft margin method will choose a hyperplane that splits the examples as cleanly as possible while still maximizing the distance to the nearest cleanly split examples the method introduces slack variables which measure the degree of misclassification of the data the objective function is then increased by a function which penalizes non zero and the optimization becomes a trade off between a large margin and a small error penalty if the penalty function is linear the optimization problem becomes subject to for any this constraint in 2 along with the objective of minimizing can be solved using lagrange multipliers as done above one has then to solve the following problem with edit dual form maximize in subject to for any and the key advantage of a linear penalty function is that the slack variables vanish from the dual problem with the constant c appearing only as an additional constraint on the lagrange multipliers for the above formulation and its huge impact in practice cortes and vapnik received the 2008 acm paris kanellakis award 3 nonlinear penalty functions have been used particularly to reduce the effect of outliers on the classifier but unless care is taken the problem becomes non convex and thus it is considerably more difficult to find a global solution edit nonlinear classification kernel machine the original optimal hyperplane algorithm proposed by vapnik in 1963 was a linear classifier however in 1992 bernhard e boser isabelle m guyon and vladimir n vapnik suggested a way to create nonlinear classifiers by applying the kernel trick originally proposed by aizerman et al 4 to maximum margin hyperplanes 5 the resulting algorithm is formally similar except that every dot product is replaced by a nonlinear kernel function this allows the algorithm to fit the maximum margin hyperplane in a transformed feature space the transformation may be nonlinear and the transformed space high dimensional thus though the classifier is a hyperplane in the high dimensional feature space it may be nonlinear in the original input space if the kernel used is a gaussian radial basis function the corresponding feature space is a hilbert space of infinite dimensions maximum margin classifiers are well regularized so the infinite dimensions do not spoil the results some common kernels include polynomial homogeneous polynomial inhomogeneous gaussian radial basis function for sometimes parametrized using hyperbolic tangent for some not every and the kernel is related to the transform by the equation the value w is also in the transformed space with dot products with w for classification can again be computed by the kernel trick i e however there does not in general exist a value w such that edit properties svms belong to a family of generalized linear classifiers and can be interpreted as an extension of the perceptron they can also be considered a special case of tikhonov regularization a special property is that they simultaneously minimize the empirical classification error and maximize the geometric margin hence they are also known as maximum margin classifiers a comparison of the svm to other classifiers has been made by meyer leisch and hornik 6 edit parameter selection the effectiveness of svm depends on the selection of kernel the kernel s parameters and soft margin parameter c a common choice is a gaussian kernel which has a single parameter best combination of c and is often selected by a grid search with exponentially growing sequences of c and for example typically each combination of parameter choices is checked using cross validation and the parameters with best cross validation accuracy are picked the final model which is used for testing and for classifying new data is then trained on the whole training set using the selected parameters 7 edit issues potential drawbacks of the svm are the following three aspects uncalibrated class membership probabilities the svm is only directly applicable for two class tasks therefore algorithms that reduce the multi class task to several binary problems have to be applied see the multi class svm section parameters of a solved model are difficult to interpret edit extensions edit multiclass svm multiclass svm aims to assign labels to instances by using support vector machines where the labels are drawn from a finite set of several elements the dominant approach for doing so is to reduce the single multiclass problem into multiple binary classification problems 8 common methods for such reduction include 8 9 building binary classifiers which distinguish between i one of the labels and the rest one versus all or ii between every pair of classes one versus one classification of new instances for the one versus all case is done by a winner takes all strategy in which the classifier with the highest output function assigns the class it is important that the output functions be calibrated to produce comparable scores for the one versus one approach classification is done by a max wins voting strategy in which every classifier assigns the instance to one of the two classes then the vote for the assigned class is increased by one vote and finally the class with the most votes determines the instance classification directed acyclic graph svm dagsvm 10 error correcting output codes 11 crammer and singer proposed a multiclass svm method which casts the multiclass classification problem into a single optimization problem rather than decomposing it into multiple binary classification problems 12 see also lee lin and wahba 13 14 edit transductive support vector machines transductive support vector machines extend svms in that they could also treat partially labeled data in semi supervised learning by following the principles of transduction here in addition to the training set the learner is also given a set of test examples to be classified formally a transductive support vector machine is defined by the following primal optimization problem 15 minimize in subject to for any and any and transductive support vector machines were introduced by vladimir n vapnik in 1998 edit structured svm svms have been generalized to structured svms where the label space is structured and of possibly infinite size edit regression a version of svm for regression was proposed in 1996 by vladimir n vapnik harris drucker christopher j c burges linda kaufman and alexander j smola 16 this method is called support vector regression svr the model produced by support vector classification as described above depends only on a subset of the training data because the cost function for building the model does not care about training points that lie beyond the margin analogously the model produced by svr depends only on a subset of the training data because the cost function for building the model ignores any training data close to the model prediction within a threshold another svm version known as least squares support vector machine ls svm has been proposed by suykens and vandewalle 17 edit implementation the parameters of the maximum margin hyperplane are derived by solving the optimization there exist several specialized algorithms for quickly solving the qp problem that arises from svms mostly relying on heuristics for breaking the problem down into smaller more manageable chunks a common method is platt s sequential minimal optimization smo algorithm which breaks the problem down into 2 dimensional sub problems that may be solved analytically eliminating the need for a numerical optimization algorithm another approach is to use an interior point method that uses newton like iterations to find a solution of the karush kuhn tucker conditions of the primal and dual problems 18 instead of solving a sequence of broken down problems this approach directly solves the problem as a whole to avoid solving a linear system involving the large kernel matrix a low rank approximation to the matrix is often used in the kernel trick edit see also in situ adaptive tabulation kernel
