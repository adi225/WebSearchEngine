algorithm design is a specific method to create a mathematical process in solving problems applied algorithm design is algorithm engineering algorithm design is identified and incorporated into many solution theories of operation research such as dynamic programming and divide and conquer techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are algorithm design patterns 1 such as template method pattern and decorator pattern and uses of data structures and name and sort lists some current day uses of algorithm design can be found in internet retrieval processes of web crawling packet routing and caching mainframe programming languages such as algol for algo rithmic l anguage fortran cobol pl i sail and snobol are computing tools to implement an algorithm design but an algorithm design a d is not a language an a d can be a hand written process e g set of equations a series of mechanical processes done by hand an analog piece of equipment or a digital process and or processor one of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient run time also known as its big oh steps in development of algorithms 1 problem definition 2 development of a modal 3 specification of algorithm 4 designing an algorithm 5 checking the correctness of algorithm 6 analysis of algorithm 7 implementation of algorithm 8 program testing 9 documentation preparation edit famous algorithms divide and conquer dynamic programming greedy algorithm edit notes goodrich michael t tamassia roberto 2002 algorithm design foundations analysis and internet examples john wiley amp sons inc isbn 160 0 471 38365 1 http ww3 algorithmdesign net ch00 front html edit further reading algorithm design paradigms overview by paul dunne at the university of liverpool stony brook algorithm repository by steven s skiena department of computer science state university of new york this mathematical analysis related article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e
