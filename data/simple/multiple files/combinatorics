not to be confused with combinatoriality combinatorics is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable discrete structures aspects of combinatorics include counting the structures of a given kind and size enumerative combinatorics deciding when certain criteria can be met and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria as in combinatorial designs and matroid theory finding largest smallest or optimal objects extremal combinatorics and combinatorial optimization and studying combinatorial structures arising in an algebraic context or applying algebraic techniques to combinatorial problems algebraic combinatorics combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics notably in algebra probability theory topology and geometry 1 and combinatorics also has many applications in optimization computer science ergodic theory and statistical physics many combinatorial questions have historically been considered in isolation giving an ad hoc solution to a problem arising in some mathematical context in the later twentieth century however powerful and general theoretical methods were developed making combinatorics into an independent branch of mathematics in its own right one of the oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is graph theory which also has numerous natural connections to other areas combinatorics is used frequently in computer science to obtain formulas and estimates in the analysis of algorithms a mathematician who studies combinatorics is called a combinatorialist contents 1 history 2

article history of combinatorics basic combinatorial concepts and enumerative results appeared throughout the ancient world in 6th century bce physician sushruta asserts in sushruta samhita that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes taken one at a time two at a time etc thus computing all 2 6 1 possibilities greek historian plutarch discusses an argument between chrysippus 3rd century bce and hipparchus 2nd century bce of a rather delicate enumerative problem which was later shown to be related to schr der numbers 2 3 in the ostomachion archimedes 3rd century bce considers a tiling puzzle in the middle ages combinatorics continued to be studied largely outside of the european civilization the indian mathematician mah v ra c 850 provided formulae for the number of permutations and combinations 4 5 and these formulas may have been familiar to indian mathematicians as early as the 6th century ce 6 the philosopher and astronomer rabbi abraham ibn ezra c 1140 established the symmetry of binomial coefficients while a closed formula was obtained later by the talmudist and mathematician levi ben gerson better known as gersonides in 1321 7 the arithmetical triangle a graphical diagram showing relationships among the binomial coefficients was presented by mathematicians in treatises dating as far back as the 10th century and would eventually become known as pascal s triangle later in medieval england campanology provided examples of what is now known as hamiltonian cycles in certain cayley graphs on permutations 8 during the renaissance together with the rest of mathematics and the sciences combinatorics enjoyed a rebirth works of pascal newton jacob bernoulli and euler became foundational in the emerging field in the modern times the works by j j sylvester late 19th century and percy macmahon early 20th century laid the foundation for enumerative and algebraic combinatorics graph theory also enjoyed an explosion of interest at the same time especially in connection with the four color problem in the second half of 20th century combinatorics enjoyed a rapid growth which led to establishment of dozens of new journals and conferences in the subject 9 in part the growth was spurred by new connections and applications to other fields ranging from algebra to probability from functional analysis to number theory etc these connections shed the boundaries between combinatorics and parts of mathematics and theoretical computer science but at the same time led to a partial fragmentation of the field edit approaches and subfields of combinatorics edit enumerative combinatorics five binary trees on three vertices an example of catalan numbers main article enumerative combinatorics enumerative combinatorics is the most classical area of combinatorics and concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad mathematical problem many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description fibonacci numbers is the basic example of a problem in enumerative combinatorics the twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations combinations and partitions edit analytic combinatorics main article analytic combinatorics analytic combinatorics concerns the enumeration of combinatorial structures using tools from complex analysis and probability theory in contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and generating functions to describe the results analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining asymptotic formulae edit partition theory a plane partition main article partition theory partition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to integer partitions and is closely related to q series special functions and orthogonal polynomials originally a part of number theory and analysis it is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field it incorporates the bijective approach and various tools in analysis analytic number theory and has connections with statistical mechanics edit graph theory petersen graph main article graph theory graphs are basic objects in combinatorics the questions range from counting e g the number of graphs on n vertices with k edges to structural e g which graphs contain hamiltonian cycles to algebraic questions e g given a graph g and two numbers x and y does the tutte polynomial t g x y have a combinatorial interpretation it should be noted that while there are very strong connections between graph theory and combinatorics these two are sometimes thought of as separate subjects 10 edit design theory main article combinatorial design design theory is a study of combinatorial designs which are collections of subsets with certain intersection properties block designs are combinatorial designs of a special type this area is one of the oldest parts of combinatorics such as in kirkman s schoolgirl problem proposed in 1850 the solution of the problem is a special case of a steiner system which systems play an important role in the classification of finite simple groups the area has further connections to coding theory and geometric combinatorics edit finite geometry main article finite geometry finite geometry is the study of geometric systems having only a finite number of points structures analogous to those found in continuous geometries euclidean plane real projective space etc but defined combinatorially are the main items studied this area provides a rich source of examples for design theory it should not be confused with discrete geometry combinatorial geometry edit order theory hasse diagram of the powerset of x y z ordered by inclusion main article order theory order theory is the study of partially ordered sets both finite and infinite various examples of partial orders appear in algebra geometry number theory and throughout combinatorics and graph theory notable classes and examples of partial orders include lattices and boolean algebras edit matroid theory main article matroid theory matroid theory abstracts part of geometry it studies the properties of sets usually finite sets of vectors in a vector space that do not depend on the particular coefficients in a linear dependence relation not only the structure but also enumerative properties belong to matroid theory matroid theory was introduced by hassler whitney and studied as a part of the order theory it is now an independent field of study with a number of connections with other parts of combinatorics edit extremal combinatorics main article extremal combinatorics extremal combinatorics studies extremal questions on set systems the types of questions addressed in this case are about the largest possible graph which satisfies certain properties for example the largest triangle free graph on 2n vertices is a complete bipartite graph k n n often it is too hard even to find the extremal answer f n exactly and one can only give an asymptotic estimate ramsey theory is another part of extremal combinatorics it states that any sufficiently large configuration will contain some sort of order it is an advanced generalization of the pigeonhole principle edit probabilistic combinatorics self avoiding walk in a square grid graph main article probabilistic method in probabilistic combinatorics the questions are of the following type what is the probability of a certain property for a random discrete object such as a random graph for instance what is the average number of triangles in a random graph probabilistic methods are also used to determine the existence of combinatorial objects with certain prescribed properties for which explicit examples might be difficult to find simply by observing that the probability of randomly selecting an object with those properties is greater than 0 this approach often referred to as the probabilistic method proved highly effective in applications to extremal combinatorics and graph theory a closely related area is the study of finite markov chains especially on combinatorial objects here again probabilistic tools are used to estimate the mixing time often associated with paul erd s who did the pioneer work on the subject probabilistic combinatorics was traditionally viewed as a set of tools to study problems in other parts of combinatorics however with the growth of applications to analysis of algorithms in computer science as well as classical probability additive and probabilistic number theory the area recently grew to become an independent field of combinatorics edit algebraic combinatorics young diagram of a partition 5 4 1 main article algebraic combinatorics algebraic combinatorics is an area of mathematics that employs methods of abstract algebra notably group theory and representation theory in various combinatorial contexts and conversely applies combinatorial techniques to problems in algebra within the last decade or so algebraic combinatorics came to be seen more expansively as the area of mathematics where the interaction of combinatorial and algebraic methods is particularly strong and significant one of the fastest developing subfields within algebraic combinatorics is combinatorial commutative algebra edit combinatorics on words construction of a thue morse infinite word main article combinatorics on words combinatorics on words deals with formal languages it arose independently within several branches of mathematics including number theory group theory and probability it has applications to enumerative combinatorics fractal analysis theoretical computer science automata theory and linguistics while many applications are new the classical chomsky sch tzenberger hierarchy of classes of formal grammars is perhaps the best known result in the field edit geometric combinatorics an icosahedron main article geometric combinatorics geometric combinatorics is related to convex and discrete geometry in particular polyhedral combinatorics it asks for example how many faces of each dimension can a convex polytope have metric properties of polytopes play an important role as well e g the cauchy theorem on rigidity of convex polytopes special polytopes are also considered such as permutohedra associahedra and birkhoff polytopes we should note that combinatorial geometry is an old fashioned name for discrete geometry edit topological combinatorics splitting a necklace with two cuts main article topological combinatorics combinatorial analogs of concepts and methods in topology are used to study graph coloring fair division partitions partially ordered sets decision trees necklace problems and discrete morse theory it should not be confused with combinatorial topology which is an older name for algebraic topology edit arithmetic combinatorics main article arithmetic combinatorics arithmetic combinatorics arose out of the interplay between number theory combinatorics ergodic theory and harmonic analysis it is about combinatorial estimates associated with arithmetic operations addition subtraction multiplication and division additive combinatorics refers to the special case when only the operations of addition and subtraction are involved one important technique in arithmetic combinatorics is the ergodic theory of dynamical systems edit infinitary combinatorics main article infinitary combinatorics infinitary combinatorics or combinatorial set theory is an extension of ideas in combinatorics to infinite sets it is a part of set theory an area of mathematical logic but uses tools and ideas from both set theory and extremal combinatorics gian carlo rota used the name continuous combinatorics 11 to describe probability and measure theory since there are many analogies between counting and measure edit related fields kissing spheres are connected to both coding theory and discrete geometry edit combinatorial optimization combinatorial optimization is the study of optimization on discrete and combinatorial objects it started as a part of combinatorics and graph theory but is now viewed as a branch of applied mathematics and computer science related to operations research algorithm theory and computational complexity theory edit coding theory coding theory started as a part of design theory with early combinatorial constructions of error correcting codes the main idea of the subject is to design efficient and reliable methods of data transmission it is now a large field of study part of information theory edit discrete and computational geometry discrete geometry also called combinatorial geometry also began a part of combinatorics with early results on convex polytopes and kissing numbers with the emergence of applications of discrete geometry to computational geometry these two fields partially merged and became a separate field of study there remain many connections with geometric and topological combinatorics which themselves can be viewed as outgrowths of the early discrete geometry edit combinatorics and dynamical systems combinatorial aspects of dynamical systems is another emerging field here dynamical systems can be defined on combinatorial objects see for example graph dynamical system edit combinatorics and physics there are increasing interactions between combinatorics and physics particularly statistical physics examples include an exact solution of the ising model and a connection
