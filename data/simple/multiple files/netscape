california 2 it is now been taken over by mozilla s firefox web browser netscape s web browser was once dominant in terms of usage share but lost most of that share to internet explorer during the first browser war the usage share of netscape had fallen from over 90 percent in the mid 1990s to less than one percent by the end of 2006 netscape is credited with developing the secure sockets layer protocol ssl for securing online communication which is still widely used 3 as well as javascript the most widely used language for client side scripting of web pages netscape stock traded from 1995 until 1999 when it was acquired by aol in a pooling of interests transaction ultimately worth us 10 160 billion 4 5 shortly before its acquisition by aol netscape released the source code for its browser and created the mozilla organization to coordinate future development of its product 6 the mozilla organization rewrote the entire browser s source code based on the gecko rendering engine 7 all future netscape releases were based on this rewritten code the gecko engine would later be used to power the mozilla foundation s firefox browser under aol netscape s browser development continued until december 2007 when tom drapeau director of aol s netscape brand announced that the company would stop supporting netscape software products as of march 1 2008 8 the netscape brand is still used

history edit early years netscape communications wants you to forget all the highway metaphors you ve ever heard about the internet instead think about an encyclopedia one with unlimited graphically rich pages connections to e mail and files and access to internet newsgroups and online shopping netscape navigator macworld may 1995 10 netscape was the first company to attempt to capitalize on the then nascent world wide web it was originally founded under the name mosaic communications corporation on april 4 1994 the brainchild of jim clark who had recruited marc andreessen as co founder and kleiner perkins caufield amp byers as investors clark recruited other early netscape team members from sgi and ncsa mosaic including rosanne siino who became vice president of communications jim barksdale came on board as ceo in january 1995 11 jim clark and marc andreessen originally created a 20 page pitch for an online gaming network to nintendo for their nintendo 64 console but a deal never panned out marc andreessen explains if they had shipped a year earlier we probably would have done that instead of netscape 12 13 the company s first product was the web browser called mosaic netscape 0 9 released on october 13 1994 this browser was subsequently renamed netscape navigator and the company took the netscape name coined by employee greg sands 11 although it was also a trademark of cisco systems 14 on november 14 1994 15 to avoid trademark ownership problems with ncsa where the initial netscape employees had previously created the ncsa mosaic web browser the mosaic netscape web browser did not use any ncsa mosaic code 16 netscape made a very successful ipo on august 9 1995 the stock was set to be offered at 14 per share but a last minute decision doubled the initial offering to 28 per share the stock s value soared to 75 on the first day of trading nearly a record for first day gain the stock closed at 58 25 meaning a market value of 2 9 160 billion the company s revenues doubled every quarter in 1995 17 netscape s success which crystallized the netscape moment 18 landed andreessen barefoot on the cover of time magazine 19 netscape advertised that the web is for everyone and stated one of its goals was to level the playing field among operating systems by providing a consistent web browsing experience across them the netscape web browser interface was identical on any computer netscape later experimented with prototypes of a web based system which would enable users to access and edit their files anywhere across a network no matter what computer or operating system they happened to be using this did not escape the attention of microsoft which viewed the commoditization of operating systems as a direct threat to its bottom line i e a move from windows to another operating system would yield a similar browsing experience thus reducing barriers to change it is alleged that several microsoft executives visited the netscape campus in june 1995 to propose dividing the market although microsoft denies this as it would have breached anti trust laws which would have allowed microsoft to produce web browser software for windows while leaving all other operating systems to netscape 20 netscape refused the proposition microsoft released version 1 0 of internet explorer as a part of the windows 95 plus pack add on according to former spyglass developer eric sink internet explorer was based not on ncsa mosaic as commonly believed but on a version of mosaic developed at spyglass 21 which itself was based upon ncsa mosaic microsoft quickly released several successive versions of internet explorer bundling them with windows never charging for them financing their development and marketing with revenues from other areas of the company this period of time became known as the browser wars in which netscape communicator and internet explorer added many new features and went through many version numbers not always in a logical fashion in attempts to outdo each other but internet explorer had the upper hand as the amount of manpower and capital dedicated to it eventually surpassed the resources available in netscape s entire business by version 3 0 ie was roughly a feature for feature equivalent of netscape communicator and by version 4 0 it was generally considered to be more stable on windows than on the macintosh platform microsoft also targeted other netscape products with free workalikes such as the internet information server iis a web server which was bundled with windows nt netscape could not compete with this strategy in fact it didn t attempt to netscape navigator was not free to the general public until january 1998 22 while internet explorer and iis have always been free or came bundled with an operating system and or other applications meanwhile netscape faced increasing criticism for the bugs in its products critics claimed that the company suffered from featuritis putting a higher priority on adding new features than on making them work properly this was particularly true with netscape navigator 2 which was only on the market for 5 months in early 1996 before being replaced by netscape navigator 3 the tide of public opinion having once lauded netscape as the david to microsoft s goliath steadily turned negative especially when netscape experienced its first bad quarter at the end of 1997 and underwent a large round of lay offs in january 1998 netscape chief financial officer peter currie described the mid 1990s as hectic and crazy and that the company was undone by factors both internal and external 23 edit open sourcing january 1998 was also the month that netscape started the open source mozilla project netscape publicly released the source code of netscape communicator 4 0 in the hopes that it would become a popular open source project it placed this code under the netscape public license which was similar to the gnu general public license but allowed netscape to continue to publish proprietary work containing the publicly released code however after having released the communicator 4 0 code this way netscape proceeded to work on communicator 4 5 which was focused on improving email and enterprise functionality it eventually became clear that the communicator 4 0 browser was too difficult to develop and open source development was halted on this codebase instead the open source development shifted to a next generation browser built from scratch using the newly built gecko layout engine this browser had a much more modular architecture than communicator 4 0 and was therefore easier to develop with a large number of programmers it also included an xml user interface language named xul that allowed single development of a user interface that ran on windows macintosh and unix the united states department of justice filed an antitrust case against microsoft in may 1998 netscape was not a plaintiff in the case though its executives were subpoenaed and it contributed much material to the case including the entire contents of the bad attitude internal discussion forum 24 in october 1998 netscape acquired web directory site newhoo for the sum of 1 160 million renamed it the open directory project and released its database under an open content license edit acquisition by america online this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed october 2008 america online aol on november 24 1998 announced it would acquire netscape communications in a tax free stock swap valued at us 4 2 160 billion at the time of the announcement 25 by the time the deal closed on march 17 1999 it was valued at us 10 160 billion 4 5 this merger was ridiculed by many who believed that the two corporate cultures could not possibly mesh one of its most prominent critics was longtime netscape developer jamie zawinski 26 the acquisition was seen as a way for aol to gain a bargaining chip against microsoft to let it become less dependent on the internet explorer web browser others believed that aol was interested in netcenter or netscape s web properties which drew some of the highest traffic worldwide eventually netscape s server products and its professional services group became part of iplanet a joint marketing and development alliance between aol and sun microsystems on november 14 2000 aol released netscape 6 based on the mozilla 0 6 source code version 5 was skipped unfortunately mozilla 0 6 was far from being stable yet and so the effect of netscape 6 was to further drive people away from the netscape brand it was not until august 2001 that netscape 6 1 appeared based on mozilla 0 9 2 which was significantly more robust a year later came netscape 7 0 based on the mozilla 1 0 core edit disbanding during the acquisition of netscape by aol joint development and marketing of netscape software products would occur through the sun netscape alliance the software in the newly branded iplanet included messaging and calendar collaboration web application directory and certificate servers as well as production ready applications for e commerce including commerce exchange procurement selling and billing 27 in march 2002 when the alliance was ended iplanet became a division of sun sun retained the intellectual property rights for all products and the engineering 28 after the microsoft antitrust case found that microsoft held and had abused monopoly power aol filed a suit against it for damages 29 this suit was settled in may 2003 when microsoft paid us 750 160 million to aol and agreed to share some technologies including granting aol a license to use and distribute internet explorer royalty free for seven years 30 31 this was considered to be the death knell for netscape on july 15 2003 time warner formerly aol time warner disbanded netscape most of the programmers were laid off and the netscape logo was removed from the building however the netscape 7 2 web browser developed in house rather than with netscape staff with some work outsourced to sun s beijing development center 32 was released by aol on august 18 2004 33 the iplanet software suite which became sun one software was rebranded in late 2003 as sun java system 28 red hat announced on september 30 2004 that it had acquired large portions of the netscape enterprise suite and was planning to convert them into an open source product to be bundled with red hat enterprise linux 34 on june 1 2005 red hat only released fedora directory server on october 12 2004 the popular developer website netscape devedge was shut down by aol devedge was an important resource for internet related technologies maintaining definitive documentation on the netscape browser documentation on associated technologies like html and javascript and popular articles written by industry and technology leaders such as danny goodman some content from devedge has been republished at the mozilla website after the sun acquisition by oracle in january 2010 oracle continued to sell iplanet branded applications which originated from netscape 35 applications include oracle iplanet web server and oracle iplanet web proxy server edit final release of the browser netscape logo 2005 2007 still used in some portals the netscape brand name continued to be used extensively the company once again had its own programming staff devoted to the development and support for the series of web browsers 36 additionally netscape also maintained the propeller web portal which was a popular social news site similar to digg which was given a new look in june 2006 aol marketed a discount isp service under the netscape brand name a new version of the netscape browser netscape navigator 9 based on firefox 2 was released in october 2007 it featured a sleek green and grey interface in november 2007 ie had 77 4 of the browser market firefox 16 0 and netscape 0 6 according to net applications an internet metrics firm 37 on december 28 2007 aol announced that on february 1 2008 it would drop support for the netscape web browser and would no longer develop new releases the date was later extended to march 1 38 to allow a major security update and to add a tool to assist users in migrating to other browsers these additional features were included in the final version of netscape navigator 9 version 9 0 0 6 released on february 20 2008 edit software main article netscape web browser edit classic releases edit netscape navigator versions 0 9 4 08 netscape navigator 2 02 main article netscape navigator netscape navigator was netscape s web browser from versions 1 0 4 8 the first beta versions were released in 1994 and were called mosaic and later mosaic netscape then a legal challenge from the national center for supercomputing applications makers of ncsa mosaic which many of netscape s founders used to develop led to the name netscape navigator the company s name also changed from mosaic communications corporation to netscape communications corporation the browser was easily the most advanced available and so was an instant success becoming market leader while still in beta netscape s feature count and market share continued to grow rapidly after version 1 0 was released version 2 0 added a full email reader called netscape mail thus transforming netscape from a mere web browser to an internet suite the main distinguishing feature of the email client was its ability to display html during this period the suite was called netscape navigator version 3 0 of netscape the first beta was codenamed atlas was the first to face any serious competition in the form of microsoft internet explorer 3 0 but netscape easily remained the number one browser for the time being netscape also released a gold version that incorporated javascript rsa security and an apple inc quicktime decoder edit netscape communicator versions 4 0 4 8 netscape communicator 4 61 for os 2 warp main article netscape communicator netscape 4 addressed the problem of netscape navigator being used as both the name of the suite and the browser contained within it by renaming the suite to netscape communicator after five preview releases in 1996 1997 netscape released the final version of netscape communicator in june 1997 this version more or less based on netscape navigator 3 code updated and added new features the new suite was successful despite increasing competition from internet explorer ie 4 0 which had a more advanced html engine and problems with the outdated browser core ie was slow and unstable on the mac platform until version 4 5 despite this apple entered into an agreement with microsoft to make ie the default browser on new mac os installations a further blow to netscape s prestige the communicator suite was made up of netscape navigator netscape mail amp newsgroups netscape address book and netscape composer an html editor in january 1998 netscape communications corporation announced that all future versions of its software would be available free of charge and developed by an open source community mozilla netscape communicator 5 0 was announced codenamed gromit however its release was greatly delayed and meanwhile there were newer versions of internet explorer starting with version 4 these had more features than the old netscape version including better support of html 4 css dom and ecmascript the more advanced internet explorer 5 0 became the market leader in october 1998 netscape communicator 4 5 was released it featured various functionality improvements especially in the mail and newsgroups component but did not update the browser core whose functionality was essentially identical to that of version 4 08 one month later netscape communications corporation was bought by aol in november work on netscape 5 0 was canceled in favor of developing a completely new program from scratch edit mozilla based releases edit netscape 6 versions 6 0 6 2 3 main article netscape 6 in 1998 an informal group called the mozilla organization was formed and largely funded by netscape the vast majority of programmers working on the code were paid by netscape to co ordinate the development of netscape 5 codenamed gromit which would be based on the communicator source code however the aging communicator code proved difficult to work with and the decision was taken to scrap netscape 5 and re write the source code the re written source code was in the form of the mozilla web browser which with a few additions netscape 6 was based on this decision meant that netscape s next major version was severely delayed in the meantime netscape was taken over by aol who acting under pressure from the web standards project forced its new division to release netscape 6 0 in 2000 the suite again consisted of netscape navigator and the other communicator components with the addition of a built in aol instant messenger client netscape instant messenger however it was clear that netscape 6 was not yet ready for release and it flopped badly it was based on mozilla 0 6 which was not ready to be used by the general public yet due to many serious bugs that would cause it to crash often or render web pages slowly later versions of netscape 6 were much improved especially 6 2 x was regarded as a good release but the browser still struggled to make an impact on a disappointed community edit netscape 7 versions 7 0 7 2 main article netscape version 7 netscape 7 0 based on mozilla 1 0 1 was released in august 2002 was a direct continuation of netscape 6 with very similar components it picked up a few users but was still very much a minority browser it did however come with the popular radio netscape internet radio client aol had decided to deactivate mozilla s popup blocker functionality in netscape 7 0 which created an outrage in the community aol learned the lesson for netscape 7 01 and allowed netscape to reinstate the popup blocker netscape also introduced a new aol free version without the usual aol addons of the browser suite netscape 7 1 codenamed buffy and based on mozilla 1 4 was released in june 2003 in 2003 aol closed down its netscape division and laid off or re assigned all of netscape s employees mozilla org continued however as the independent mozilla foundation taking on many of netscape s ex employees aol continued to develop netscape in house with help from sun s beijing development center 32 but due to there being no staff committed to it improvements were minimal one year later in august 2004 the last version based on mozilla was released netscape 7 2 based on mozilla 1 7 2 after an official poll posted on netscape s community support board in late 2006 speculation arose of the netscape 7 series of suites being fully supported and updated by netscape s in house development team

browser aol chose to base netscape browser on the relatively successful mozilla firefox a re written version of mozilla produced by the mozilla foundation this release is not a full internet suite as before but is solely a web browser other controversial decisions include the browser s being made only for microsoft windows and its featuring both the gecko rendering engine of previous releases and the trident engine used in internet explorer aol s acquisition of netscape communications in november 1998 42 made it less of a surprise when the company laid off the netscape team and outsourced development to mercurial communications when netscape browser 8 1 3 was released on april 2 2007 and included general bug fixes identified in versions 8 0 8 1 2 43 44 edit netscape navigator version 9

propeller internet portal 45 alongside more enhanced methods of discussion submission and voting on web pages 46 it also sees the browser return to multi platform support across windows linux and mac os x 47 like netscape version 8 x the new release was based upon the popular mozilla firefox version 2 0 and supposedly had full support of all firefox add ons and plugins some of which netscape was already providing 48 also for the first time since 2004 the browser was produced in house with its own programming staff 49 a beta of the program was first released on june 5 2007 50 the final version was released on october 15 2007 edit end of development and support aol officially announced 51 that support for netscape navigator would end on march 1 2008 and recommended that its users download either the flock or firefox browsers both of which were based on the same technology the decision met mixed reactions from communities with many arguing that the termination of product support is significantly belated internet security site security watch stated that a trend of infrequent security updates for aol s netscape caused the browser to become a security liability specifically the 2005 2007 versions netscape browser 8 52 asa dotzler one of firefox s original bug testers greeted the news with good riddance in his blog post but praised the various members of the netscape team over the years for enabling the creation of mozilla in 1998 53 others protested and petitioned aol to continue providing vital security fixes to unknowing or loyal users of its software as well as protection of a well known brand 54 55 56 edit mozilla thunderbird based releases edit netscape messenger 9 main article netscape messenger 9 on june 11 2007 netscape announced netscape mercury a

netscape created the javascript web page scripting language it also pioneered the development of push technology which effectively allowed web sites to send regular updates of information weather stock updates package tracking etc directly to a user s desktop aka webtop netscape s implementation of this was named netcaster 60 unfortunately businesses quickly recognized the use of push technology to deliver ads to users and annoyed users turned off the feature so netcaster was short lived netscape was notable for its cross platform efforts its client software continued to be made available for windows 3 1 95 98 nt macintosh linux os 2 beos and many versions of unix including dec sun solaris bsdi irix ibm aix and hp ux its server software generally was only available for unix

edit web accelerator the web accelerator precompresses text at the server side to approximately 4 its original size increasing effective throughput to 1300 kbit s the accelerator also precompresses flash executables and images to approximately 30 and 10 respectively netscape advertises this as dsl speeds over regular phone lines although such speeds are limited to only web browsing not downloads of files another drawback of this approach is a loss in quality where the graphics become heavily compacted and smeared but the speed is dramatically improved such that web pages load in less than 5 seconds edit netscape com netscape always drove lots of traffic from various links included in the browser menus to its web properties some say it was very late to leverage this traffic for what would become the start of the major online portal wars when it did netcenter the new name for its http home netscape com site entered the race with yahoo infoseek and msn which google would only join years later the original netscape com was discontinued in june 2006 replaced by the site that would eventually become propeller com two continuations of the original netscape com portal are available

social news website in september 2007 the social news site moved to the propeller com domain where it stayed until ending operations in october 2010 it features facilities such as news sports horoscopes dating movies music and more the change has come to much criticism amongst many site users because the site has effectively become an aol clone and simply re directs to regional aol portals
