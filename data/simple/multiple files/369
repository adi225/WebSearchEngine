meta elements are the html or xhtml lt meta gt element used to provide structured metadata about a web page multiple elements are often used on the same page the element is the same but its attributes are different meta elements can be used to specify page description keywords and any other metadata not provided through the other head elements and attributes the meta element has two uses either to emulate the use of the http response header or to embed additional metadata within the html document with html up to and including html 4 01 and xhtml there were four valid attributes content http equiv name and scheme under html 5 there are now five valid attributes charset having been added http equiv is used to emulate the http header name to embed metadata the value of the statement in either case is contained in the content attribute which is the only required attribute unless charset is given charset is used to indicate the character set of the document and is available in html5 such elements must be placed as tags in the head section of an html or xhtml document contents 1 an example of the use of the meta element 2 meta element used in search engine optimization 2 1 the

meta elements can specify http headers which should be sent before the actual content when the html page is served from web server to client for example lt meta http equiv content type content text html gt this specifies that the page should be served with an http header called content type that has a value text html in the general form a meta element specifies name and associated content attributes describing aspects of the html page for example lt meta name keywords content wikipedia encyclopedia gt in this example the meta element identifies itself as containing the keywords relevant to the document wikipedia and encyclopedia meta tags can be used to indicate the location a business serves lt meta name zipcode content 45212 45208 45218 gt in this example geographical information is given according to zip codes default charset for plain text is simply set with meta lt meta http equiv content type content text html charset utf 8 gt edit meta element used in search engine optimization meta elements provide information about a given web page most often to help search engines categorize them correctly they are inserted into the html document but are often not directly visible to a user visiting the site they have been the focus of a field of marketing research known as search engine optimization seo where different methods are explored to provide a user s site with a higher ranking on search engines in the mid to late 1990s search engines were reliant on meta data to correctly classify a web page and webmasters quickly learned the commercial significance of having the right meta element as it frequently led to a high ranking in the search engines and thus high traffic to the website as search engine traffic achieved greater significance in online marketing plans consultants were brought in who were well versed in how search engines perceive a website these consultants used a variety of techniques legitimate and otherwise to improve ranking for their clients meta elements have significantly less effect on search engine results pages today than they did in the 1990s and their utility has decreased dramatically as search engine robots have become more sophisticated this is due in part to the nearly infinite re occurrence keyword stuffing of meta elements and or to attempts by unscrupulous website placement consultants to manipulate spamdexing or otherwise circumvent search engine ranking algorithms while search engine optimization can improve search engine ranking consumers of such services should be careful to employ only reputable providers given the extraordinary competition and technological craftsmanship required for top search engine placement the implication of the term search engine optimization has deteriorated over the last decade where it once implied bringing a website to the top of a search engine s results page for some consumers it now implies a relationship with keyword spamming or optimizing a site s internal search engine for improved performance major search engine robots are more likely to quantify such extant factors as the volume of incoming links from related websites quantity and quality of content technical precision of source code spelling functional v broken hyperlinks volume and consistency of searches and or viewer traffic time within website page views revisits click throughs technical user features uniqueness redundancy relevance advertising revenue yield freshness geography language and other intrinsic characteristics edit the keywords attribute the keywords attribute was popularized by search engines such as infoseek and altavista in 1995 and its popularity quickly grew until it became one of the most commonly used meta elements 1 by late 1997 however search engine providers realized that information stored in meta elements especially the keywords attribute was often unreliable and misleading and at worst used to draw users into spam sites unscrupulous webmasters could easily place false keywords into their meta elements in order to draw people to their site search engines began dropping support for metadata provided by the meta element in 1998 and by the early 2000s most search engines had veered completely away from reliance on meta elements in july 2002 altavista one of the last major search engines to still offer support finally stopped considering them 2 no consensus exists whether or not the keywords attribute has any effect on ranking at any of the major search engines today it is speculated that it does if the keywords used in the meta can also be found in the page copy itself with respect to google thirty seven leaders in search engine optimization concluded in april 2007 that the relevance of having your keywords in the meta attribute keywords is little to none 3 and in september 2009 matt cutts of google announced that they are no longer taking keywords into account whatsoever 4 however both these articles suggest that yahoo still makes use of the keywords meta tag in some of its rankings yahoo itself claims support for the keywords meta tag in conjunction with other factors for improving search rankings 5 in oct 2009 search engine round table announced that yahoo drops the meta keywords tag also 6 but informed us that the announcement made by yahoo s senior director of search was incorrect 7 in the corrected statement yahoo senior director of search states that what changed with yahoo s ranking algorithms is that while we still index the meta keyword tag the ranking importance given to meta keyword tags receives the lowest ranking signal in our system it will actually have less effect than introducing those same words in the body of the document or any other section 7 in sept 2012 google 8 announced that they will consider keyword meta tag for news publishers google said that this may help worthy content to get noticed the syntax of the 9 has subtle difference from custom keyword meta tag it is denoted by news keywords while custom keyword meta tag is denoted by keywords edit the description attribute unlike the keywords attribute the description attribute is supported by most major search engines like yahoo and bing while google will fall back on this tag when information about the page itself is requested e g using the related query the description attribute provides a concise explanation of a web page s content this allows the web page authors to give a more meaningful description for listings than might be displayed if the search engine was unable to automatically create its own description based on the page content the description is often but not always displayed on search engine results pages so it can affect click through rates industry commentators have suggested that major search engines also consider keywords located in the description attribute when ranking pages 10 w3c doesn t specify the size of this description meta tag but almost all search engines recommend it to be shorter than 155 characters of plain text citation needed edit the language attribute the language attribute tells search engines what natural language the website is written in e g english spanish or french as opposed to the coding language e g html it is normally an ietf language tag for the language name it is of most use when a website is written in multiple languages and can be included on each page to tell search engines in which language a particular page is written 11 edit the robots attribute the robots attribute supported by several major search engines 12 not in citation given controls whether search engine spiders are allowed to index a page or not and whether they should follow links from a page or not the attribute can contain one or more comma separate values the noindex value prevents a page from being indexed and nofollow prevents links from being crawled other values recognized by one or more search engines can influence how the engine indexes pages and how those pages appear on the search results these include noarchive which instructs a search engine not to store an archived copy of the page and nosnippet which asks that the search engine not include a snippet from the page along with the page s listing in search results 13 meta tags are not the best option to prevent search engines from indexing content of a website a more reliable and efficient method is the use of the robots txt file robots exclusion standard edit additional attributes for search engines edit noodp the search engines google yahoo and msn use in some cases the title and abstract of the open directory project odp listing of a website for the title and or description also called snippet or abstract in the search engine results pages serp to give webmasters the option to specify that the odp content should not be used for listings of their website microsoft introduced in may 2006 the new noodp value for the robots element of the meta tags 14 google followed in july 2006 15 and yahoo in october 2006 16 the syntax is the same for all search engines who support the tag lt meta name robots content noodp gt webmasters can decide if they want to disallow the use of their odp listing on a per search engine basis google lt meta name googlebot content noodp gt yahoo lt meta name slurp content noodp gt msn and live search via bingbot previously msnbot lt meta name bingbot content noodp gt edit noydir yahoo puts content from their own yahoo directory next to the odp listing in 2007 they introduced a meta tag that lets web designers opt out of this 17 if you add the noydir tag to a page yahoo won t display the yahoo directory titles and abstracts lt meta name robots content noydir gt lt meta name slurp content noydir gt edit robots nocontent yahoo also introduced in may 2007 the attribute value class robots nocontent 18 this is not a meta tag but an attribute and value which can be used throughout web page tags where needed content of the page where this attribute is being used will be ignored by the yahoo crawler and not included in the search engine s index examples for the use of the robots nocontent tag lt div class robots nocontent gt excluded content lt div gt lt span class robots nocontent gt excluded content lt span gt lt p class robots nocontent gt excluded content lt p gt edit academic studies google does not use html keyword or meta tag elements for indexing the director of research at google monika henzinger was quoted in 2002 as saying currently we don t trust metadata because we are afraid of being manipulated 19 other search engines developed techniques to penalize web sites considered to be cheating the system for example a web site repeating the same meta keyword several times may have its ranking decreased by a search engine trying to eliminate this practice though that is unlikely it is more likely that a search engine will ignore the meta keyword element completely and most do regardless of how many words used in the element google does however use meta tag elements for displaying site links the title tags are used to create the link in search results lt title gt site name page title keyword description lt title gt the meta description often appears in google search results to describe the link lt meta name description content a blurb to describe the content of the page appears here gt edit redirects meta refresh elements can be used to instruct a web browser to automatically refresh a web page after a given time interval it is also possible to specify an alternative url and use this technique in order to redirect the user to a different location auto refreshing via a meta element has been deprecated for more than ten years 20 and recognized as problematic before that 21 the w3c suggests that user agents should allow users to disable it otherwise meta refresh should not be used by web pages for internet explorer s security settings under the miscellaneous category meta refresh can be turned off by the user thereby disabling its redirect ability in mozilla firefox it can be disabled in the configuration file under the key name accessibility blockautorefresh 22 many web design tutorials also point out that client side redirecting tends to interfere with the normal functioning of a web browser s back button after being redirected clicking the back button will cause the user to go back to the redirect page which redirects them again some modern browsers seem to overcome this problem however including safari mozilla firefox and opera citation needed auto redirects via markup versus server side redirects are not in compliance with the w3c s web content accessibility guidelines wcag 1 0 guideline 7 5 23 edit http message headers meta elements of the form lt meta http equiv foo content bar gt can be used as alternatives to http headers for example lt meta http equiv expires content wed 21 june 2006 14 25 27 gmt gt would tell the browser that the page expires on june 21 2006 at 14 25 27 gmt and that it may safely cache the page until then the html 4 01 specification optionally allows this tag to be parsed by http servers and set as part of the http response headers 24 but no web servers currently implement this behavior 25 instead the user agent emulates the behavior for some http headers as if they had been sent in the response header itself edit alternative to meta elements an alternative to meta elements for enhanced subject access within a website is the use of a back of book style index for the website see the american society of indexers website for an example in 1994 aliweb also used an index file to provide the type of information commonly found in meta keywords attributes edit
