the examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject please improve this article and discuss the issue on the talk page july 2012 the dot com bubble also referred to as the dot com boom the internet bubble and the information technology bubble 1 was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 1997 2000 with a climax on march 10 2000 with the nasdaq peaking at 5132 52 in intraday trading before closing at 5048 62 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the internet sector and related fields while the latter part was a boom and bust cycle the internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the internet with the advent of the world wide web as exemplified by the first release of the mosaic web browser in 1993 and continuing through the 1990s the period was marked by the founding and in many cases spectacular failure of a group of new internet based companies commonly referred to as dot coms companies were seeing their stock prices shoot up if they simply added an e prefix to their name and or a com to the end which one author called prefix investing 2 a combination of rapidly increasing stock prices market confidence that the companies would turn future profits individual speculation in stocks and widely available venture capital created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics such as p e ratio in favor of confidence in technological advancements the collapse of the bubble took place during 2000 2001 some companies such as pets com failed completely others lost a large portion of their market capitalization but remained stable and profitable e g cisco whose stock declined by 86 some later recovered and surpassed their dot com bubble peaks e g amazon com whose stock went from 107 to 7 dollars per share but a decade later exceeded 200 contents 1 bubble growth 2

9 further reading 10 external links edit bubble growth venture capitalists saw record setting growth as dot com companies experienced meteoric rises in their stock prices and therefore moved faster and with less caution than usual choosing to mitigate the risk by starting many contenders and letting the market decide which would succeed the low interest rates in 1998 99 helped increase the start up capital amounts a canonical dot com company s business model relied on harnessing network effects by operating at a sustained net loss to build market share or mind share these companies offered their services or end product for free with the expectation that they could build enough brand awareness to charge profitable rates for their services later the motto get big fast reflected this strategy edit soaring stocks in financial markets a stock market bubble is a self perpetuating rise or boom in the share prices of stocks of a particular industry the term may be used with certainty only in retrospect when share prices have since crashed a bubble occurs when speculators note the fast increase in value and decide to buy in anticipation of further rises rather than because the shares are undervalued typically many companies thus become grossly overvalued when the bubble bursts the share prices fall dramatically and many companies go out of business american news media including respected business publications such as forbes and the wall street journal encouraged the public to invest in risky companies despite many of the companies disregard for basic financial and even legal principles 3 andrew smith 4 has argued that the financial industry s handling of initial public offerings tended to benefit the banks and initial investors rather than the company itself this is because company staff were typically barred from reselling their shares for a lock in period of 12 to 18 months and so did not benefit from the common pattern of a huge short lived spike in the share price on the day of the launch by contrast the financiers and other initial investors were typically entitled to sell at the peak price and so could immediately profit from short term price rises smith argues that the high profitability of the ipos to wall street was a significant factor the course of events of the bubble he writes but did the kids the often young dotcom entrepreneurs dupe the establishment by drawing them into fake companies or did the establishment dupe the kids by introducing them to mammon and charging a commission on it in spite of this however a few company founders made vast fortunes when their companies were bought out at an early stage in the dot com stock market bubble these early successes made the bubble even more buoyant an unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred during the boom and the press reported the phenomenon of people quitting their jobs to become full time day traders 5 6 7 edit free spending according to dot com theory an internet company s survival depended on expanding its customer base as rapidly as possible even if it produced large annual losses for instance google and amazon did not see any profit in their first years amazon was spending on expanding customer base and alerting people to its existence and google was busy spending on creating more powerful machine capacity to serve its expanding search engine citation needed the phrase get large or get lost was the wisdom of the day 8 at the height of the boom it was possible for a promising dot com to make an initial public offering ipo of its stock and raise a substantial amount of money even though it had never made a profit or in some cases earned any revenue whatsoever citation needed in such a situation a company s lifespan was measured by its burn rate that is the rate at which a non profitable company lacking a viable business model ran through its capital served as the metric public awareness campaigns were one of the ways in which dot coms sought to expand their customer bases these included television ads print ads and targeting of professional sporting events many dot coms named themselves with onomatopoeic nonsense words that they hoped would be memorable and not easily confused with a competitor super bowl xxxiv in january 2000 featured 17 dot com companies that each paid over 2 million for a 30 second spot by contrast in january 2001 just three dot coms bought advertising spots during super bowl xxxv in a similar vein cbs backed iwon com gave away 10 million to a lucky contestant on an april 15 2000 half hour primetime special that was broadcast on cbs not surprisingly the growth over profits mentality and the aura of new economy invincibility led some companies to engage in lavish internal spending such as elaborate business facilities and luxury vacations for employees executives and employees who were paid with stock options instead of cash became instant millionaires when the company made its initial public offering many invested their new wealth into yet more dot coms cities all over the united states sought to become the next silicon valley by building network enabled office space to attract internet entrepreneurs communication providers convinced that the future economy would require ubiquitous broadband access went deeply into debt to improve their networks with high speed equipment and fiber optic cables companies that produced network equipment like nortel networks were irrevocably damaged by such over extension nortel declared bankruptcy in early 2009 companies like cisco which did not have any production facilities but bought from other manufacturers were able to leave quickly and actually do well from the situation as the bubble burst and products were sold cheaply in the struggle to become a technology hub many cities and states used tax money to fund technology conference centers advanced infrastructure and created favorable business and tax law to encourage development of the dot com industry in their locale virginia s technology corridor is a prime example of this activity large quantities of high speed fiber links were laid and the state and local governments gave tax exemptions to technology firms many of these buildings could be viewed along i 495 after the burst as vacant office buildings similarly in europe the vast amounts of cash the mobile operators spent on 3g licences in germany italy and the united kingdom for example led them into deep debt the investments were far out of proportion to both their current and projected cash flow but this was not publicly acknowledged until as late as 2001 and 2002 due to the highly networked nature of the it industry this quickly led to problems for small companies dependent on contracts from operators one example is of a then finnish mobile network company sonera which paid huge sums in german broadband auction then dubbed as 3g licenses 3rd generation networks however took years to catch on and sonera ended up as a part of teliasonera then simply telia edit the bubble bursts the technology heavy nasdaq composite index peaked at 5 048 in march 2000 reflecting the high point of the dot com bubble over 1999 and early 2000 the u s federal reserve increased interest rates six times 9 and the economy began to lose speed the dot com bubble burst numerically on friday march 10 2000 when the technology heavy nasdaq composite index peaked at 5 048 62 intra day peak 5 132 52 more than double its value just a year before 10 the nasdaq fell slightly after that but this was attributed to correction by most market analysts the actual reversal and subsequent bear market may have been triggered by the adverse findings of fact in the united states v microsoft case which was being heard in federal court citation needed the findings which declared microsoft a monopoly were widely expected in the weeks before their release on april 3 citation needed the following day april 4 the nasdaq fell from 4 283 points to 3 649 and rebounded back to 4 223 forming an intraday chart that looked like a stretched v on march 20 2000 after the nasdaq had lost more than 10 percent from its peak financial magazine barron s shocked the market with its cover story burning up sean parker stated during the next 12 months scores of highflying internet upstarts will have used up all

grown to the point that they are collectively valued at 1 3 trillion which amounts to about 8 of the entire u s stock market 11 by 2001 the bubble was deflating at full speed a majority of the dot

the third largest corporate bankruptcy in u s history other examples include northpoint communications global crossing jds uniphase xo communications and covad communications companies such as nortel cisco and corning were at a disadvantage because they relied on infrastructure that was never developed which caused the stock of corning to drop significantly many dot coms ran out of capital and were acquired or liquidated the domain names were picked up by old economy competitors or domain name investors several companies and their executives were accused or convicted of fraud for misusing shareholders money and the u s securities and exchange commission fined top investment firms like citigroup and merrill lynch millions of dollars for misleading investors various supporting industries such as advertising and shipping scaled back their operations as demand for their services fell a few large dot com companies such as amazon com and ebay survived the turmoil and appear assured of long term survival while others such as google have become industry dominating mega firms the stock market crash of 2000 2002 caused the loss of 5 trillion in the market value of companies from march 2000 to october 2002 14 the 9 11 terrorist destruction of the world trade center s twin towers killing almost 700 employees of cantor fitzgerald accelerated the stock market drop the nyse suspended trading for four sessions when trading resumed some of it was transacted in temporary new locations more in depth analysis shows that 90 of the dot coms companies survived through 2004 15 with this it is safe to assume that the assets lost from the stock market do not directly link to the closing of firms more importantly however it can be concluded that even companies who were categorized as the small players were adequate enough to endure the destruction of the financial market during 2000 2002 16 additionally retail investors who felt burned by the burst transitioned their investment portfolios to more cautious positions nevertheless laid off technology experts such as computer programmers found a glutted job market university degree programs for computer related careers saw a noticeable drop in new students anecdotes of unemployed programmers going back to school to become accountants or lawyers were common turning to the long term legacy of the bubble fred wilson financier who was a venture capitalist during it said 4 a friend of mine has a great line he says nothing important has ever been built without irrational exuberance meaning that you need some of this mania to cause investors to open up their pocketbooks and finance the building of the railroads or the automobile or aerospace industry or whatever and in this case much of the capital invested was lost but also much of it was invested in a very high throughput backbone for the internet and lots of software that works and databases and server structure all that stuff has allowed what we have today which has changed all our lives that s what all this speculative mania built edit list of companies significant to the bubble for discussion and a list of dot com companies outside the scope of
