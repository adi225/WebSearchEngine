spss modeler professional used for structured data such as databases mainframe data systems flat files or bi systems spss modeler premium includes all the features of modeler professional with the addition of text analytics entity analytics social network analysis both editions are available in desktop and server configurations edit architecture spss modeler has a three tier design users manipulate icons and options in the front end application on windows operating systems this front end client application then communicates with the modeler server or directly with a database or dataset the most common configuration in large corporations is to house the modeler server software on a powerful analytical server box windows unix linux which then connects to the corporate data warehouse data processing commands are automatically converted from the icon based user interface into a command code which is not visible and is sent to the modeler server for processing where possible this command code will be further compiled into sql and processed in the data warehouse nb this section needs further updating edit features modeling algorithms included automatic

originally developed by a uk company named integral solutions limited isl 9 the tool quickly garnered the attention of the data mining community at that time in its infancy original in many respects it was the first data mining tool to use an icon based graphical user interface rather than requiring users to write in a programming language in 1998 isl was acquired by spss inc who saw the potential for extended development as a commercial data mining tool in early 2000 the software was developed into a client server architecture and shortly afterward the client front end interface component was completely re written and replaced with a superior java front end spss clementine version 12 0 the client front end runs under windows the server back end unix variants sun hp ux aix linux and windows the graphical user interface is written in java ibm spss modeler 14 2 was the first release of modeler by ibm ibm spss modeler 15 released in june 2012 introduced significant new
