himself as a mining engineer while living in manhattan and completed his ph d in 1890 at columbia university he eventually moved to washington d c living in georgetown with a home on 29th street and ultimately a factory for manufacturing his tabulating machines at 31st street and the c amp o canal where today there is a commemorative plaque placed by ibm he died in washington d c edit electrical tabulation of data hollerith tabulating machine and sorter at the urging of john shaw billings 1 hollerith developed a mechanism using electrical connections to trigger a counter recording information a key idea was that data could be coded numerically hollerith determined that if numbers could be punched in specified locations on a card in the now familiar rows and columns then the cards could be counted or sorted mechanically and the data recorded a description of this system an electric tabulating system 1889 was submitted by hollerith to columbia university as his doctoral thesis and is reprinted in randell s book 2 on january 8 1889 hollerith was issued u s patent 395 782 3 claim 2 of which reads the herein described method of compiling statistics which consists in recording separate statistical items pertaining to the individual by holes or combinations of holes punched in sheets of electrically non conducting material and bearing a specific relation to each other and to a standard and then counting or tallying such statistical items separately or in combination by means of mechanical counters operated by electro magnets the circuits through which are controlled by the perforated sheets substantially as and for the purpose set forth edit inventions and businesses hollerith punched card hollerith had left teaching and begun working for the united states census office in the year he filed his first patent application titled art of compiling statistics it was filed on september 23 1884 u s patent 395 782 was granted on january 8 1889 4 patents 395 781 395 782 and 395 783 was published in the scientific american on january 18 1889 5 hollerith card puncher used by the united states census bureau hollerith built machines under contract for the census office which used them to tabulate the 1890 census in only one year 6 the 1880 census had taken eight years hollerith then started his own business in 1896 founding the tabulating machine company most of the major census bureaus around the world leased his equipment and purchased his cards as did major insurance companies to make his system work he invented the first automatic card feed mechanism and the first key punch that is a punch operated by a keyboard a skilled operator could punch 200 300 cards per hour he also invented a tabulator the 1890 tabulator was hardwired to operate only on 1890 census cards a plugboard control panel in his 1906 type i tabulator allowed it to do different jobs without being rebuilt the first step towards programming these inventions were among the foundations of the modern information processing industry in 1911 four corporations including hollerith s firm merged to form the computing tabulating recording company ctr 7 under the presidency of thomas j watson it was renamed international business machines corporation ibm in 1924 edit see also hollerith constants also sometimes called hollerith strings were an early type of string constant
