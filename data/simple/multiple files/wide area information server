wide area information servers or wais is a client server text searching system that uses the ansi standard z39 50 information retrieval service definition and protocol specifications for library applications z39 50 1988 to search index databases on remote computers it was developed in the late 1980s as a project of thinking machines apple computer dow jones and kpmg peat marwick wais did not adhere to either the standard or its osi framework adopting instead tcp ip but created a unique protocol inspired by z39 50 1988 contents 1 history 2 directory of servers 3 people 4 wais and gopher 5

massively parallel cm 2 connection machine and sparc based cm 5 mp supercomputers wais clients were developed for various operating systems and windowing systems including microsoft windows macintosh next x window gnu emacs and character terminals 1 tmc however released a free open source version of wais to run on unix in 1991 inspired by the wais project on full text databases and emerging sgml projects z39 50 version 2 or z39 50 1992 was released unlike its 1988 predecessor it was a compatible superset of the iso 10162 10163 work that had been done internationally with the advent of z39 50 1992 the termination of support for the free wais from thinking machines and the establishment of wais inc as a commercial venture the u s national science foundation funded cnidr to create a clearinghouse of information related to internet search and discovery systems and to promote open source and standards cnidr created a new freely available open source wais this created first the freewais package based on the wais 8 b5 codebase implemented by thinking machines corp and then a wholly new software suite isite based upon z39 50 1992 with isearch as its full text search engine ulrich pfeifer and norbert g vert of the computer science department of the university of dortmund took the cnidr freewais code and extended it to become freewais sf sf means structured fields and indicated its main improvement ulrich pfeifer rewrote freewais sf in perl where it became wait hgfhh inspired also by wais especially its directory of servers eliot christian of usgs envisioned gils government information locator service gils based upon z39 50 1992 with some wais like extensions became a u s federal mandate as part of the paperwork reduction act of 1995 44 u s c 160 160 3511 edit directory of servers this section does not cite any references or sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march 2011 thinking machines corp provided a service called the directory of servers it was a wais server like any other information source but contained information about the other wais servers on the internet when one would create a wais server with the tmc wais code it would create a special kind of record containing metadata and some common words to describe the content of the index it would be uploaded to the central server and indexed along with the records from other public servers one could search the directory to find servers that might have content relevant to a specific field of interest this model of searching for wais servers to search became the role model for gils and peter deutsch s whois distributed white pages directory edit people this section does not cite any

and harry morris left thinking machines to found wais inc in menlo park california with bruce gilliat wais inc was originally developed as a joint project between apple computer peat markwick dow jones and thinking machines in 1992 the presidential campaign of ross perot used wais as a campaign wide information system connecting the field offices to the national office later perot systems adopted wais to better access the information in its corporate databases other early clients were the environmental protection agency library of congress and the department of energy and later the wall street journal and encyclop dia britannica wais inc was sold to aol in may 1995 for 15 million following the sale margaret st pierre left wais inc to start blue angel technologies her wais variant formed the basis of metastar georgios papadopoulos left to found atypon fran ois schiettecatte left human genome project at johns hopkins hospital and started fs consult and developed his own variant of wais which eventually became scienceserver which was later sold to elsevier science kahle and gilliat went on to found the internet archive and alexa internet edit wais and gopher public wais is often used as a full text search engine for individual internet gopher servers supplementing the popular veronica system which only searches the menu titles of gopher sites wais and gopher share the world wide web s client server architecture and a certain amount of its functionality the wais protocol is influenced largely by the z39 50 protocol designed for networking library catalogs it allows a text based search and retrieval following a search gopher provides a free text search mechanism but principally uses menus a menu is a list of titles from which the user may pick one while gopher space is a web containing many loops the menu system gives the user the impression of a tree 2 the w3 data model is similar to the gopher model except that menus are generalized to hypertext documents in both cases simple file servers generate the menus or hypertext directly from the file structure of a server the w3 hypertext model gives the program more power to communicate the options available to the reader as it can include headings and various forms of list structure 2 edit references kahle brewster morris harry goldman jonathan erickson thomas curran john 1993 interfaces for
