the story was reprinted in the book collection executive comic book in 1962 with the artwork modified by elder to obscure the appearance of the archie characters archie comics found their appearance still too close to their copyrighted properties and threatened another lawsuit kurtzman and elder settled out of court by handing over the copyright to the story archie comics held on to the copyright

archie comics issued a cease and desist order threatening litigation if the play proceeded as written dad s garage artistic director sean daniels said the play was to depict archie and his pals from riverdale growing up coming out and facing censorship archie comics thought if archie was portrayed as being gay that would dilute and tarnish his image 15 it opened a few days later as weird comic book fantasy with the character names changed 16 edit characters main article list of archie comics characters edit archie and riverdale main article archie andrews comics archie is set in the small town of riverdale while the state or even the general location of the town is unspecified john l goldwater attended horace mann school in the riverdale section of the bronx new york city in the early years of archie riverdale was located in massachusetts with mr lodge being a senator for that state but this is no longer considered canon citation needed drawings of riverdale high school appeared to follow the general design of the original high school now city hall in haverhill mass the thinker statue still sits outside the front entrance just like it did in the comic strip one newspaper that carries the archie comic strip the haverhill edition of the lawrence eagle tribune calls the strip haverhill s archie it was said that characters in the strip were based on people in haverhill especially at the high school which was attended by bob montana montana first sketched them on a napkin in 1941 while sitting at the chocolate shop on merrimack street in haverhill the shop is gone but archie fans know that it lives forever as the choklit shoppe on riverdale s main street the new york times postulated that the cartoonist bob montana inked the original likenesses of archie and his pals and plopped them in an idyllic midwestern community named riverdale because mr goldwater a new yorker had fond memories of time spent in hiawatha kan 17 for the comics 60th anniversary in 2002 several geographical and historical hints to the location of riverdale were printed in every digest issue at the end of the year it was revealed where that the hints point to riverdale being located in the missouri area but that officially riverdale has no location it is essentially located wherever the reader wants it to be indeed the geography of riverdale is far too inconsistent for it to be any one specific location see below in 2011 a copy of archie comics 1 first published in 1942 was sold at auction for 167 300 a world record for a non superhero comic book 18 edit superheroes at various points archie comics has experimented with publishing various superhero titles archie has also been a superhero in some comics such as pureheart beginning with blue ribbon comics 1 november

featuring a number of high profile talents including steve englehart jim valentino marv wolfman michael bair kelley jones and rob liefeld planned spectrum titles included the fly the fox hangman jaguar mister justice and the shield ultimately archie cancelled the entire spectrum comics before publishing a single issue 20 edit impact comics main article impact comics archie s super heroes were
