as a result of the digital revolution many aspects of life are now captured and stored in digital form concern has been expressed that governments may use this information to conduct mass surveillance on their populations commercial mass surveillance often makes use of copyright laws and user agreements to obtain typically uninformed consent to surveillance from consumers who use their software or other related materials this allows gathering of information which would be technically illegal if performed by government agencies this data is then often shared with government agencies thereby in practice defeating the purpose of such privacy protections one of the most common forms of mass surveillance is carried out by commercial organizations many people are willing to join supermarket and grocery loyalty card programs trading their personal information and surveillance of their shopping habits in exchange for a discount on their groceries although base prices might be increased to encourage participation in the program since a significant proportion of purchases are carried out by credit or debit cards which can also be easily tracked it is questionable whether loyalty cards provide any significant additional privacy threat through programs like google s adsense opensocial and their increasing pool of so called web gadgets social gadgets and other google hosted services many web sites on the internet are effectively feeding user information about sites visited by the users and now also their social connections to google facebook also keep this information although

huge revolution 75 at the 2010 mobile world congress in barcelona february 16 google presented their vision of a new business model for mobile operators and trying to convince mobile operators to embrace location based services and advertising with google as the advertising provider it would mean that every mobile operator using their location based advertising service would be revealing the location of their mobile customers to google 76 google will also know more about the customer because it benefits the customer to tell google more about them the more we know about the customer the better the quality of searches the better the quality of the apps the operator one is required if you will and the google one will be optional and today i would say a minority choose to do that but i think over time a majority will because of the stored values in the servers and so forth and so on 2010 mobile world congress keynote speech google ceo eric schmidt 77 organizations like the
