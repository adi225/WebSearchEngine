lt ontology gt each concept s definition should start with lt concept gt tag and ends with lt concept gt tag lt inherit gt tag shows inheritance relations and lt has gt tag shows attributable relations between two concepts either of defined concepts has default attribute object identifier id to be used by web crawlers to co ordinate the same object s attributes used in different pages of the same website website parse template foresees several predefined concepts that are general for all kind of websites menu navigation bar menu logo design element logo content element that contains main textual content of the page advertisement advertisement banner external link element that contains external links edit wpt templates templates section contains number of templates for groups of similarly structured web pages either of those templates refers to a single group of similarly structured web pages html elements xpath references or tagids are used for linking structured content with defined concepts the template description starts with opening lt template gt tags and ends with closing lt template gt tag in lt template gt tag it is required to specify template name and language used for templates description as a template name can be chosen any string but for the language it is necessary to indicate supported language type e g icdl template rdf or unl expression

container gt lt template gt in case of specified complex html element is already described by another template the lt reference gt tag can be used to point to that template block it makes possible to create hierarchic relations between wpt templates so that web crawlers can use specified reference s to identify the same object in different pages of a given website example 4 hierarchic relations between wpt templates lt template name artist page on yahoo music language icdl template gt lt html tag tagid biography content artist bio reference artist bio gt lt template gt lt template name
