vector space model or term vector model is an algebraic model for representing text documents and any objects in general as vectors of identifiers such as for example index terms it is used in information filtering information retrieval indexing and relevancy rankings its first use was in the smart information retrieval system contents 1 definitions 2 applications 3 example tf idf weights 4

references edit definitions documents and queries are represented as vectors each dimension corresponds to a separate term if a term occurs in the document its value in the vector is non zero several different ways of computing these values also known as term weights have been developed one of the best known schemes is tf idf weighting see the example below the definition of term depends on the application typically terms are single words keywords or longer phrases if the words are chosen to be the terms the dimensionality of the vector is the number of words in the vocabulary the number of distinct words occurring in the corpus vector operations can be used to compare documents with queries edit applications relevance rankings of documents in a keyword search can be calculated using the assumptions of document similarities theory by comparing the deviation of angles between each document vector and the original query vector where the query is represented as the same kind of vector as the documents in practice it is easier to calculate the cosine of the angle between the vectors instead of the angle itself where is the intersection i e the dot product of the document d 2 in the figure to the right and the query q in the figure vectors is the norm of vector d 2 and is the norm of vector q the norm of a vector is calculated as such as all vectors under consideration by this model are elementwise nonnegative a cosine value of zero means that the query and document vector are orthogonal and have no match i e the query term does not exist in the document being considered see cosine similarity for further information edit example tf idf weights in the classic vector space model proposed by salton wong and yang 1 the term specific weights in the document vectors are products of local and global parameters the model is known as term frequency inverse document frequency model the weight vector for document d is where and is term frequency of term t in document d a local parameter is inverse document frequency a global parameter is the total number of documents in the document set is the number of documents containing the term t using the cosine the similarity between document d j and query q can be calculated as in a simpler term count model the term specific weights do not include the global parameter instead the weights are just the counts of term occurrences edit advantages the vector space model has the following advantages over the standard boolean model simple model based on linear algebra term weights not binary allows computing a continuous degree of similarity between queries and documents allows ranking documents according to their possible relevance allows partial matching edit limitations the vector space model has the following limitations long documents are poorly represented because they have poor similarity values a small scalar product and a large dimensionality search keywords must precisely match document terms word substrings might result in a false positive match semantic sensitivity documents with similar context but different term vocabulary won t be associated resulting in a false negative match the order in which the terms appear in the document is lost in the vector space representation assumes terms are statistically independent weighting is intuitive but not very formal many of these difficulties can however be overcome by the integration of various tools including mathematical techniques such as singular value decomposition and lexical databases such as wordnet edit models based
