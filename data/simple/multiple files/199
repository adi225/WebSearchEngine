noticed a pattern of differing responses to search engine queries based on a user s past internet search history such that people with a liberal orientation would get one set of responses while conservatives might get an entirely different set of responses if a person used google or facebook or yahoo to search for a specific phrase or term on the internet 4 for example a liberal typing bp might get information about the oil spill in the gulf of mexico while a conservative typing bp might get investment information about the oil company this led to his development of the concept of a filter bubble which he described in a book in which he argued that there was a danger that people would not get exposed to viewpoints different than their own 4 5 edit works eli pariser the filter
