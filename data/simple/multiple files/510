planning on starting a new popular science magazine to be called the sciences purchased the assets of the old scientific american instead and put its name on the designs they had created for their new

to this article scientific american issue 1 cover of the september 1848 issue it originally styled itself the advocate of industry and enterprise and journal of mechanical and other improvements on the front page of the first issue was the engraving of improved rail road cars the masthead had a commentary as follows scientific american published every thursday morning at no 11 spruce street new york no 16 state street boston and no 2l arcade philadelphia the principal office being in new york by rufus porter each number will be furnished with from two to five original engravings many of them elegant and illustrative of new inventions scientific principles and curious works and will contain in high addition to the most interesting news of passing events general notices of progress of mechanical and other scientific improvements american and foreign improvements and inventions catalogues of american patents scientific essays illustrative of the principles of the sciences of mechanics chemistry and architecture useful information and instruction in various arts and trades curious philosophical experiments miscellaneous intelligence music and poetry this paper is especially entitled to the patronage of mechanics and manufactures being the only paper in america devoted to the interest of those classes but is particularly useful to farmers as it will not only appraise them of improvements in agriculture implements but instruct them in various mechanical trades and guard them against impositions as a family newspaper it will convey more useful intelligence to children and young people than five times its cost in school instruction another important argument in favor of this paper is that it will be worth two dollars at the end of the year when the volume is complete old volumes of the new york mechanic being now worth double the original cost in cash terms the scientific american will be furnished to subscribers at 2 00 per annum one dollar in advance and the balance in six months five copies will be sent to one address six months for four dollars in advance any person procuring two or more subscribers will be entitled to a commission of 25 cents each the commentary under the illustration gives the flavor of its style at the time there is perhaps no mechanical subject in which improvement has advanced so rapidly within the last ten years as that of railroad passenger cars let any person contrast the awkward and uncouth cars of 35 with the superbly splendid long cars now running on several of the eastern roads and he will find it difficult to convey to a third party a correct idea of the vast extent of improvement some of the most elegant cars of this class and which are of a capacity to accommodate from sixty to eighty passengers and run with a steadiness hardly equaled by a steamboat in still water are manufactured by davenport amp bridges at their establishment in cambridgeport mass the manufacturers have recently introduced a variety of excellent improvements in the construction of trucks springs and connections which are calculated to avoid atmospheric resistance secure safety and convenience and contribute ease and comfort to passengers while flying at the rate of 30 or 40 miles per hour also in the first issue is commentary on signor muzio muzzi s proposed device for aerial navigation edit editors

scientific and political debate in april 1950 the u s atomic energy commission ordered scientific american to cease publication of an issue containing an article by hans bethe that appeared to reveal classified information about the thermonuclear hydrogen bomb subsequent review of the material determined that the aec had overreacted the incident was important for the new scientific american s history as the aec s decision to burn 3000 copies of an early press run of the magazine containing the offending material appeared to be book burning in a free society when publisher gerard piel leaked the incident to the press 8 in its january 2002 issue scientific american published a series of criticisms of the bjorn lomborg book the skeptical environmentalist cato institute fellow patrick j michaels said the attacks came because the book threatens billions of taxpayer dollars that go into the global change kitty every year 9 journalist ronald bailey called the criticism disturbing and dishonest writing the subhead of the review section science defends itself against the skeptical environmentalist gives the show away religious and political views need to defend themselves against criticism but science is supposed to be a process for determining the facts 10 the may 2007 issue featured a column by michael shermer calling for a united states pullout from the iraq war 11 in response wall street journal online columnist james taranto jokingly called scientific american a liberal political magazine 12 the publisher was criticized in 2009 when it notified collegiate libraries that subscribe to the journal that yearly subscription prices would increase by nearly 500 for print and 50 for online access to 1500 yearly 13 edit see also albert graham ingalls former
