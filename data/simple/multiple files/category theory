a category with objects x y z and morphisms f g g f and three identity morphisms not shown 1 x 1 y and 1 z this article includes a list of references but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations november 2009 category theory is used to formalize mathematics and its concepts as a collection of objects and arrows also called morphisms category theory can be used to formalize concepts of other high level abstractions such as set theory field theory and group theory several terms used in category theory including the term morphism differ from their uses within mathematics itself in category theory a morphism obeys a set of conditions specific to category theory itself thus care must

many significant areas of mathematics can be formalised by category theory as categories category theory is an abstraction of mathematics itself that allows many intricate and subtle mathematical results in these fields to be stated and proved in a much simpler way than without the use of categories 1 the most accessible example of a category is the category of sets where the objects are sets and the arrows are functions from one set to another however the objects of a category need not be sets nor the arrows functions any way of formalising a mathematical concept such that it meets the basic conditions on the behaviour of objects and arrows is a valid category and all the results of category theory will apply to it one of the simplest examples of a category is that of groupoid defined as a category whose arrows or morphisms are all invertible the groupoid concept is important in topology categories now appear in most branches of mathematics some areas of theoretical computer science where they correspond to types and mathematical physics where they can be used to describe vector spaces categories were first introduced by samuel eilenberg and saunders mac lane in 1942 45 in connection with algebraic topology category theory has several faces known not just to specialists but to other mathematicians a term dating from the 1940s general abstract nonsense refers to its high level of abstraction compared to more classical branches of mathematics homological algebra is category theory in its aspect of organising and suggesting manipulations in abstract algebra edit utility edit categories objects and morphisms the study of categories is an attempt to axiomatically capture what is commonly found in various classes of related mathematical structures by relating them to the structure preserving functions between them a systematic study of category theory then allows us to prove general results about any of these types of mathematical structures from the axioms of a category consider the following example the class grp of groups consists of all objects having a group structure one can proceed to prove theorems about groups by making logical deductions from the set of axioms for example it is immediately proven from the axioms that the identity element of a group is unique instead of focusing merely on the individual objects e g groups possessing a given structure category theory emphasizes the morphisms the structure preserving mappings between these objects by studying these morphisms we are able to learn more about the structure of the objects in the case of groups the morphisms are the group homomorphisms a group homomorphism between two groups preserves the group structure in a precise sense it is a process taking one group to another in a way that carries along information about the structure of the first group into the second group the study of group homomorphisms then provides a tool for studying general properties of groups and consequences of the group axioms a similar type of investigation occurs in many mathematical theories such as the study of continuous maps morphisms between topological spaces in topology the associated category is called top and the study of smooth functions morphisms in manifold theory if one axiomatizes relations instead of functions one obtains the theory of allegories edit functors main article functor see also adjoint functors motivation a category is itself a type of mathematical structure so we can look for processes which preserve this structure in some sense such a process is called a functor diagram chasing is a visual method of arguing with abstract arrows joined in diagrams functors are represented by arrows between categories subject to specific defining commutativity conditions functors can define construct categorical diagrams and sequences viz mitchell 1965 a functor associates to every object of one category an object of another category and to every morphism in the first category a morphism in the second in fact what we have done is define a category of categories and functors the objects are categories and the morphisms between categories are functors by studying categories and functors we are not just studying a class of mathematical structures and the morphisms between them we are studying the relationships between various classes of mathematical structures this is a fundamental idea which first surfaced in algebraic topology difficult topological questions can be translated into algebraic questions which are often easier to solve basic constructions such as the fundamental group or fundamental groupoid of a topological space can be expressed as fundamental functors to the category of groupoids in this way and the concept is pervasive in algebra and its applications edit natural transformations main article natural transformation abstracting yet again some diagrammatic and or sequential constructions are often naturally related a vague notion at first sight this leads to the clarifying concept of natural transformation a way to map one functor to another many important constructions in mathematics can be studied in this context naturality is a principle like general covariance in physics that cuts deeper than is initially apparent an arrow between two functors is a natural transformation when it is subject to certain naturality or commutativity conditions functors and natural transformations naturality are the key concepts in category theory 2 edit categories objects and morphisms main articles category mathematics and morphism edit categories a category c consists of the following three mathematical entities a class ob c whose elements are called objects a class hom c whose elements are called morphisms or maps or arrows each morphism f has a source object a and target object b the expression f 160 a b would be verbally stated as f is a morphism from a to b the expression hom a b alternatively expressed as hom c a b mor a b or c a b denotes the hom class of all morphisms from a to b a binary operation called composition of morphisms such that for any three objects a b and c we have hom b c hom a b hom a c the composition of f 160 a b and g 160 b c is written as g f or gf 3 governed by two axioms associativity if f 160 a b g 160 b c and h 160 c d then h g f h g f and identity for every object x there exists a morphism 1 x 160 x x called the identity morphism for x such that for every morphism f 160 a b we have 1 b f f f 1 a from the axioms it can be proved that there is exactly one identity morphism for every object some authors deviate from the definition just given by identifying each object with its identity morphism edit morphisms relations among morphisms such as fg h are often depicted using commutative diagrams with points corners representing objects and arrows representing morphisms morphisms can have any of the following properties a morphism f 160 a b is a monomorphism or monic if f g 1 f g 2 implies g 1 g 2 for all morphisms g 1 g 2 160 x a epimorphism or epic if g 1 f g 2 f implies g 1 g 2 for all morphisms g 1 g 2 160 b x bimorphism if f is both epic and monic isomorphism if there exists a morphism g 160 b a such that f g 1 b and g f 1 a 4 endomorphism if a b end a denotes the class of endomorphisms of a automorphism if f is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism aut a denotes the class of automorphisms of a retraction if a right inverse of f exists i e if there exists a morphism g 160 b a with fg 1 b section if a left inverse of f exists i e if there exists a morphism g 160 b a with gf 1 a every retraction is an epimorphism and every section is a monomorphism furthermore the following three statements are equivalent f is a monomorphism and a retraction f is an epimorphism and a section f is an isomorphism edit functors main article functor functors are structure preserving maps between categories they can be thought of as morphisms in the category of all small categories a covariant functor f from a category c to a category d written f 160 c d consists of for each object x in c an object f x in d and for each morphism f 160 x y in c a morphism f f 160 f x f y such that the following two properties hold for every object x in c f 1 x 1 f x for all morphisms f 160 x y and g 160 y z f g f f g f f a contravariant functor f c d is like a covariant functor except that it turns morphisms around reverses all the arrows more specifically every morphism f 160 x y in c must be assigned to a morphism f f 160 f y f x in d in other words a contravariant functor acts as a covariant functor from the opposite category c op to d edit natural transformations main article natural transformation a natural transformation is a relation between two functors functors often describe natural constructions and natural transformations then describe natural homomorphisms between two such constructions sometimes two quite different constructions yield the same result this is expressed by a natural isomorphism between the two functors if f and g are covariant functors between the categories c and d then a natural transformation from f to g associates to every object x in c a morphism x 160 f x g x in d such that for every morphism f 160 x y in c we have y f f g f x this means that the following diagram is commutative the two functors f and g are called naturally isomorphic if there exists a natural transformation from f to g such that x is an isomorphism for every object x in c edit other concepts edit universal constructions limits and colimits main articles universal property and limit category theory using the language of category theory many areas of mathematical study can be categorized categories include sets groups topologies and so on each category is distinguished by properties that all its objects have in common such as the empty set or the product of two topologies yet in the definition of a category objects are considered to be atomic i e we do not know whether an object a is a set a topology or any other abstract concept hence the challenge is to define special objects without referring to the internal structure of those objects to define the empty set without referring to elements or the product topology without referring to open sets one can characterize these objects in terms of their relations to other objects as given by the morphisms of the respective categories thus the task is to find universal properties that uniquely determine the objects of interest indeed it turns out that numerous important constructions can be described in a purely categorical way the central concept which is needed for this purpose is called categorical limit and can be dualized to yield the notion of a colimit edit equivalent categories main articles equivalence of categories and isomorphism of categories it is a natural question to ask under which conditions can two categories be considered to be essentially the same in the sense that theorems about one category can readily be transformed into theorems about the other category the major tool one employs to describe such a situation is called equivalence of categories which is given by appropriate functors between two categories categorical equivalence has found numerous applications in mathematics edit further concepts and results the definitions of categories and functors provide only the very basics of categorical algebra additional important topics are listed below although there are strong interrelations between all of these topics the given order can be considered as a guideline for further reading the functor category d c has as objects the functors from c to d and as morphisms the natural transformations of such functors the yoneda lemma is one of the most famous basic results of category theory it describes representable functors in functor categories duality every statement theorem or definition in category theory has a dual which is essentially obtained by reversing all the arrows if one statement is true in a category c then its dual will be true in the dual category c op this duality which is transparent at the level of category theory is often obscured in applications and can lead to surprising relationships adjoint functors a functor can be left or right adjoint to another functor that maps in the opposite direction such a pair of adjoint functors typically arises from a construction defined by a universal property this can be seen as a more abstract and powerful view on universal properties edit higher dimensional categories many of the above concepts especially equivalence of categories adjoint functor pairs and functor categories can be situated into the context of higher dimensional categories briefly if we consider a morphism between two objects as a process taking us from one object to another then higher dimensional categories allow us to profitably generalize this by considering higher dimensional processes for example a strict 2 category is a category together with morphisms between morphisms i e processes which allow us to transform one morphism into another we can then compose these bimorphisms both horizontally and vertically and we require a 2 dimensional exchange law to hold relating the two composition laws in this context the standard example is cat the 2 category of all small categories and in this example bimorphisms of morphisms are simply natural transformations of morphisms in the usual sense another basic example is to consider a 2 category with a single object these are essentially monoidal categories bicategories are a weaker notion of 2 dimensional categories in which the composition of morphisms is not strictly associative but only associative up to an isomorphism this process can be extended for all natural numbers n and these are called n categories there is even a notion of category corresponding to the ordinal number higher dimensional categories are part of the broader mathematical field of higher dimensional algebra a concept introduced by ronald brown for a conversational introduction to these ideas see john baez a tale of n categories 1996 edit historical notes in 1942 45 samuel eilenberg and saunders mac lane introduced categories functors and natural transformations as part of their work in topology especially algebraic topology their work was an important part of the transition from intuitive and geometric homology to axiomatic homology theory eilenberg and mac lane later wrote that their goal was to understand natural transformations in order to do that functors had to be defined which required categories stanislaw ulam and some writing on his behalf have claimed that related ideas were current in the late 1930s in poland eilenberg was polish and studied mathematics in poland in the 1930s category theory is also in some sense a continuation of the work of emmy noether one of mac lane s teachers in formalizing abstract processes noether realized that in order to understand a type of mathematical structure one needs to understand the processes preserving that structure in order to achieve this understanding eilenberg and mac lane proposed an axiomatic formalization of the relation between structures and the processes preserving them the subsequent development of category theory was powered first by the computational needs of homological algebra and later by the axiomatic needs of algebraic geometry the field most resistant to being grounded in either axiomatic set theory or the russell whitehead view of united foundations general category theory an extension of universal algebra having many new features allowing for semantic flexibility and higher order logic came later it is now applied throughout mathematics certain categories called topoi singular topos can even serve as an alternative to axiomatic set theory as a foundation of mathematics a topos can also be considered as a specific type of category with two additional topos axioms these foundational applications of category theory have been worked out in fair detail as a basis for and justification of constructive mathematics topos theory is a form of abstract sheaf theory with geometric origins and leads to ideas such as pointless topology categorical logic is now a well defined field based on type theory for intuitionistic logics with applications in functional programming and domain theory where a cartesian closed category is taken as a non syntactic description of a lambda calculus at the very least category theoretic language clarifies what exactly these related areas have in common in some abstract sense category theory has been applied in other fields as well for example john baez has shown a link between feynman diagrams in physics and monoidal categories 5 another application of category theory more specifically topos theory has been made in mathematical music theory see for example the book the topos of music geometric logic of concepts theory and performance by guerino mazzola more recent efforts to introduce undergraduates to categories as a foundation for mathematics include william lawvere and rosebrugh 2003 and lawvere and stephen schanuel 1997 and mirroslav yotov 2012 edit see also category theory portal domain theory
