a relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally described tables from which data can be accessed easily a relational database is created using the relational model the software used in a relational database is called a relational database management system rdbms a relational database is the predominant choice in storing data over other models like the hierarchical database model or the network model it consists of n number tables and each table has its own primary key the relational database was first defined in june 1970 by edgar codd of ibm s san

which are roughly equivalent to sql database terminology the table below summarizes some of the most important relational database terms and their sql database equivalents it was first introduced in 1970 following the work of e f codd relational term sql equivalent relation base relvar table derived relvar view query result result set tuple row attribute name column name relation scheme set of attributes set of column names attribute value column data edit relations or tables main articles relation database and table database a relation is defined as a set of tuples that have the same attributes a tuple usually represents an object and information about that object objects are typically physical objects or concepts a relation is usually described as a table which is organized into rows and columns all the data referenced by an attribute are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints the relational model specifies that the tuples of a relation have no specific order and that the tuples in turn impose no order on the attributes applications access data by specifying queries which use operations such as select to identify tuples project to identify attributes and join to combine relations relations can be modified using the insert delete and update operators new tuples can supply explicit values or be derived from a query similarly queries identify tuples for updating or deleting it is necessary for each tuple of a relation to be uniquely identifiable by some combination one or more of its attribute values this combination is referred to as the primary key edit base and derived relations main articles relvar and view database in a relational database all data are stored and accessed via relations relations that store data are called base relations and in implementations are called tables other relations do not store data but are computed by applying relational operations to other relations these relations are sometimes called derived relations in implementations these are called views or queries derived relations are convenient in that they act as a single relation even though they may grab information from several relations also derived relations can be used as an abstraction layer edit domain main article data domain a domain describes the set of possible values for a given attribute and can be considered a constraint on the value of the attribute mathematically attaching a domain to an attribute means that any value for the attribute must be an element of the specified set the character data value abc for instance is not in the integer domain the integer value 123 satisfies the domain constraint edit constraints constraints make it possible to further restrict the domain of an attribute for instance a constraint can restrict a given integer attribute to values between 1 and 10 constraints provide one method of implementing business rules in the database sql implements constraint functionality in the form of check constraints constraints restrict the data that can be stored in relations these are usually defined using expressions that result in a boolean value indicating whether or not the data satisfies the constraint constraints can apply to single attributes to a tuple restricting combinations of attributes or to an entire relation since every attribute has an associated domain there are constraints domain constraints the two principal rules for the relational model are known as entity integrity and referential integrity edit primary keys main article unique key a primary key uniquely defines a relationship vague within a database in order for an attribute to be a good primary key it must not repeat while natural attributes attributes used to describe the data being entered are sometimes good primary keys surrogate keys are often used instead a surrogate key is an artificial attribute assigned to an object which uniquely identifies it for instance in a table of information about students at a school they might all be assigned a student id in order to differentiate them the surrogate key has no intrinsic inherent meaning but rather is useful through its ability to uniquely identify a tuple another common occurrence especially in regards to n m cardinality is the composite key a composite key is a key made up of two or more attributes within a table that together uniquely identify a record for example in a database relating students teachers and classes classes could be uniquely identified by a composite key of their room number and time slot since no other class could have exactly the same combination of attributes in fact use of a composite key such as this can be a form of data verification albeit a weak one edit foreign key main article foreign key a foreign key is a field in a relational table that matches the primary key column of another table the foreign key can be used to cross reference tables foreign keys need not have unique values in the referencing relation foreign keys effectively use the values of attributes in the referenced relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes in the referencing relation a foreign key could be described formally as for all tuples in the referencing relation projected over the referencing attributes there must exist a tuple in the referenced relation projected over those same attributes such that the values in each of the referencing attributes match the corresponding values in the referenced attributes edit stored procedures main article stored procedure a stored procedure is executable code that is associated with and generally stored in the database stored procedures usually collect and customize common operations like inserting a tuple into a relation gathering statistical information about usage patterns or encapsulating complex business logic and calculations frequently they are used as an application programming interface api for security or simplicity implementations of stored procedures on sql rdbmss often allow developers to take advantage of procedural extensions often vendor specific to the standard declarative sql syntax stored procedures are not part of the relational database model but all commercial implementations include them edit index main article index database an index is one way of providing quicker access to data indices can be created on any combination of attributes on a relation queries that filter using those attributes can find matching tuples randomly using the index without having to check each tuple in turn this is analogous to using the index of a book to go directly to the page on which the information you are looking for is found so that you do not have to read the entire book to find what you are looking for relational databases typically supply multiple indexing techniques each of which is optimal for some combination of data distribution relation size and typical access pattern indices are usually implemented via b trees r trees and bitmaps indices are usually not considered part of the database as they are considered an implementation detail though indices are usually maintained by the same group that maintains the other parts of the database it should be noted that use of efficient indexes on both primary and foreign keys can dramatically improve query performance this is because b tree indexes result in query times proportional to log n where n is the number of rows in a table and hash indexes result in constant time queries no size dependency so long as the relevant part of the index fits into memory edit relational operations main article relational algebra queries made against the relational database and the derived relvars in the database are expressed in a relational calculus or a relational algebra in his original relational algebra codd introduced eight relational operators in two groups of four operators each the first four operators were based on the traditional mathematical set operations the union operator combines the tuples of two relations and removes all duplicate tuples from the result the relational union operator is equivalent to the sql union operator the intersection operator produces the set of tuples that two relations share in common intersection is implemented in sql in the form of the intersect operator the difference operator acts on two relations and produces the set of tuples from the first relation that do not exist in the second relation difference is implemented in sql in the form of the except or minus operator the cartesian product of two relations is a join that is not restricted by any criteria resulting in every tuple of the first relation being matched with every tuple of the second relation the cartesian product is implemented in sql as the cross join operator the remaining operators proposed by codd involve special operations specific to relational databases the selection or restriction operation retrieves tuples from a relation limiting the results to only those that meet a specific criteria i e a subset in terms of set theory the sql equivalent of selection is the select query statement with a where clause the projection operation extracts only the specified attributes from a tuple or set of tuples the join operation defined for relational databases is often referred to as a natural join in this type of join two relations are connected by their common attributes sql s approximation of a natural join is the inner join operator the relational division operation is a slightly more complex operation which involves essentially using the tuples of one relation the dividend to partition a second relation the divisor the relational division operator is effectively the opposite of the cartesian product operator hence the name other operators have been introduced or proposed since codd s introduction of the original eight including relational comparison operators and extensions that offer support for nesting and hierarchical data among others edit normalization main article database normalization normalization was first proposed by codd as an integral part of the relational model it encompasses a set of procedures designed to eliminate nonsimple domains non atomic values and the redundancy duplication of data which in turn prevents data manipulation anomalies and loss of data integrity the most common forms of normalization applied to databases are called the normal forms edit relational database management systems main article relational database management system relational databases as implemented in relational database management systems have become a predominant choice for the storage of information in new databases used for financial records manufacturing and logistical information personnel data and much more relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they are easier to understand and use even though they are much less efficient as computer power has increased the inefficiencies of relational databases which made them impractical in earlier times have been outweighed by their ease of use however relational databases have been challenged by object databases which were introduced in an attempt to address the object relational impedance mismatch in relational database and xml databases the three leading commercial relational database vendors are oracle microsoft and ibm 2 the three leading open source implementations are mysql postgresql and sqlite amazon relational database service is a database as a service offering mysql and oracle database engines edit references codd e f 1970 a relational model of data for large shared data banks communications of the acm 13 6 377 387 doi 10
