apoc was incorporated as a subsidiary of burmah oil company to exploit this 17 apoc and the armenian businessman calouste gulbenkian were the driving forces behind the creation of turkish petroleum

minister winston churchill as a paid consultant to lobby the british government to allow apoc have exclusive rights to persian oil resources which were successfully granted 19 in 1925 tpc received concession in the mesopotamian oil resources from the iraqi government under british mandate tpc finally struck oil in iraq on 14 october 1927 in 1928 the apoc s shareholding in tpc which by now named iraq petroleum company ipc would be reduced to 23 75 as the result of the changing geopolitics post ottoman empire break up and the red line agreement 20 in 1935 rez sh h requested the international community to refer persia as iran which reflected in the name change of apoc to the anglo iranian oil company aioc 17 the pro west hashemite monarchy 1932 58 in iraq and ipc relations were generally cordial in spite of disputes centred around more iraqi involvement and getting more royalties during the 1928 68 time period ipc monopolised oil exploration inside the red line excluding saudi arabia and bahrain citation needed following world war ii nationalistic sentiments were on the rise in the middle east most notable being iranian nationalism and arab nationalism in iran aioc and the pro western iranian government led by prime minister ali razmara initially resisted nationalist pressure to revise aioc s concession terms still further in iran s favour in march 1951 ali razmara was assassinated and mohammed mossadeq a nationalist was elected as the new prime minister by the majlis of iran parliament 21 22 in april 1951 the majlis nationalised the iranian oil industry by unanimous vote and the national iranian oil company nioc was formed displacing the aioc 23 24 the aioc withdrew its management from iran and organised an effective worldwide embargo of iranian oil the british government which owned the aioc contested the nationalisation at the international court of justice at the hague but its complaint was dismissed 25 after the 1953 iranian coup d tat 26 in august 1953 the coup brought pro western general fazlollah zahedi as the new pm along with the return of the shah mohammad reza pahlavi from his brief exile in italy to iran 27 the anti mossadeq plan
