able to help recruit an expert july 2012 grid computing is the federation of computer resources from multiple locations to reach a common goal the grid can be thought of as a distributed system with non interactive workloads that involve a large number of files what distinguishes grid computing from conventional high performance computing systems such as cluster computing is that grids tend to be more loosely coupled heterogeneous and geographically dispersed 1 although a single grid can be dedicated to a particular application commonly a grid is used for a variety of purposes grids are often constructed with general purpose grid middleware software libraries grid size varies a considerable amount grids are a form of distributed computing whereby a super virtual computer is composed of many networked loosely coupled computers acting together to perform large tasks for certain applications distributed or grid computing can be seen as a special type of parallel computing that relies on complete computers with onboard cpus storage power supplies network interfaces etc connected to a network private public or the internet by a conventional network interface such as ethernet this is in contrast to the traditional notion of a supercomputer which has many processors connected by a local high speed computer bus contents 1 overview 2 comparison of grids and conventional

of same class of computers clustered together a grid computer is connected through a super fast network and share the devices like disk drives mass storage printers and ram grid computing is a cost efficient solution with respect to super computing operating system has capability of parallelism grid computing combines computers from multiple administrative domains to reach a common goal 2 to solve a single task and may then disappear just as quickly one of the main strategies of grid computing is to use middleware to divide and apportion pieces of a program among several computers sometimes up to many thousands grid computing involves computation in a distributed fashion which may also involve the aggregation of large scale cluster computing based systems the size of a grid may vary from small confined to a network of computer workstations within a corporation for example to large public collaborations across many companies and networks the notion of a confined grid may also be known as an intra nodes cooperation whilst the notion of a larger wider grid may thus refer to an inter nodes cooperation 3 grids are a form of distributed computing whereby a super virtual computer is composed of many networked loosely coupled computers acting together to perform very large tasks this technology has been applied to computationally intensive scientific mathematical and academic problems through volunteer computing and it is used in commercial enterprises for such diverse applications as drug discovery economic forecasting seismic analysis and back office data processing in support for e commerce and web services coordinating applications on grids can be a complex task especially when coordinating the flow of information across distributed computing resources grid workflow systems have been developed as a specialized form of a workflow management system designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps or a workflow in the grid context edit comparison of grids and conventional supercomputers distributed or grid computing in general is a special type of parallel computing that relies on complete computers with onboard cpus storage power supplies network interfaces etc connected to a network private public or the internet by a conventional network interface such as ethernet this is in contrast to the traditional notion of a supercomputer which has many processors connected by a local high speed computer bus citation needed the primary advantage of distributed computing is that each node can be purchased as commodity hardware which when combined can produce a similar computing resource as multiprocessor supercomputer but at a lower cost this is due to the economies of scale of producing commodity hardware compared to the lower efficiency of designing and constructing a small number of custom supercomputers the primary performance disadvantage is that the various processors and local storage areas do not have high speed connections this arrangement is thus well suited to applications in which multiple parallel computations can take place independently without the need to communicate intermediate results between processors 4 the high end scalability of geographically dispersed grids is generally favorable due to the low need for connectivity between nodes relative to the capacity of the public internet citation needed there are also some differences in programming and deployment it can be costly and difficult to write programs that can run in the environment of a supercomputer which may have a custom operating system or require the program to address concurrency issues if a problem can be adequately parallelized a thin layer of grid infrastructure can allow conventional standalone programs given a different part of the same problem to run on multiple machines this makes it possible to write and debug on a single conventional machine and eliminates complications due to multiple instances of the same program running in the same shared memory and storage space at the same time edit design considerations and variations one feature of distributed grids is that they can be formed from computing resources belonging to multiple individuals or organizations known as multiple administrative domains this can facilitate commercial transactions as in utility computing or make it easier to assemble volunteer computing networks citation needed one disadvantage of this feature is that the computers which are actually performing the calculations might not be entirely trustworthy the designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false misleading or erroneous results and from using the system as an attack vector this often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes presumably with different owners and checking that at least two different nodes report the same answer for a given work unit discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious nodes citation needed due to the lack of central control over the hardware there is no way to guarantee that nodes will not drop out of the network at random times some nodes like laptops or dialup internet customers may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods these variations can be accommodated by assigning large work units thus reducing the need for continuous network connectivity and reassigning work units when a given node fails to report its results in expected time citation needed the impacts of trust and availability on performance and development difficulty can influence the choice of whether to deploy onto a dedicated computer cluster to idle machines internal to the developing organization or to an open external network of volunteers or contractors citation needed in many cases the participating nodes must trust the central system not to abuse the access that is being granted by interfering with the operation of other programs mangling stored information transmitting private data or creating new security holes other systems employ measures to reduce the amount of trust client nodes must place in the central system such as placing applications in virtual machines citation needed public systems or those crossing administrative domains including different departments in the same organization often result in the need to run on heterogeneous systems using different operating systems and hardware architectures with many languages there is a trade off between investment in software development and the number of platforms that can be supported and thus the size of the resulting network cross platform languages can reduce the need to make this trade off though potentially at the expense of high performance on any given node due to run time interpretation or lack of optimization for the particular platform citation needed there are diverse scientific and commercial projects to harness a particular associated grid or for the purpose of setting up new grids boinc is a common one for various academic projects seeking public volunteers citation needed more are listed at the end of the article in fact the middleware can be seen as a layer between the hardware and the software on top of the middleware a number of technical areas have to be considered and these may or may not be middleware independent example areas include sla management trust and security virtual organization management license management portals and data management these technical areas may be taken care of in a commercial solution though the cutting edge of each area is often found within specific research projects examining the field citation needed edit market segmentation of the grid computing market for the segmentation of the grid computing market two perspectives need to be considered the provider side and the user side edit the provider side the overall grid market comprises several specific markets these are the grid middleware market the market for grid enabled applications the utility computing market and the software as a service saas market grid middleware is a specific software product which enables the sharing of heterogeneous resources and virtual organizations it is installed and integrated into the existing infrastructure of the involved company or companies and provides a special layer placed among the heterogeneous infrastructure and the specific user applications major grid middlewares are globus toolkit glite and unicore utility computing is referred to as the provision of grid computing and applications as service either as an open grid utility or as a hosting solution for one organization or a vo major players in the utility computing market are sun microsystems ibm and hp grid enabled applications are specific software applications that can utilize grid infrastructure this is made possible by the use of grid middleware as pointed out above software as a service saas is software that is owned delivered and managed remotely by one or more providers gartner 2007 additionally saas applications are based on a single set of common code and data definitions they are consumed in a one to many model and saas uses a pay as you go payg model or a subscription model that is based on usage providers of saas do not necessarily own the computing resources themselves which are required to run their saas therefore saas providers may draw upon the utility computing market the utility computing market provides computing resources for saas providers edit the user side for companies on the demand or user side of the grid computing market the different segments have significant implications for their it deployment strategy the it deployment strategy as well as the type of it investments made are relevant aspects for potential grid users and play an important role for grid adoption edit cpu scavenging cpu scavenging cycle scavenging cycle stealing or shared computing creates a grid from the unused resources in a network of participants whether worldwide or internal to an organization typically this technique uses desktop computer instruction cycles that would otherwise be wasted at night during lunch or even in the scattered seconds throughout the day when the computer is waiting for user input or slow devices in practice participating computers also donate some supporting amount of disk storage space ram and network bandwidth in addition to raw cpu power many volunteer computing projects such as boinc use the cpu scavenging model since nodes are likely to go offline from time to time as their owners use their resources for their primary purpose this model must be designed to handle such contingencies 5 edit history the term grid computing originated in the early 1990s as a metaphor for making computer power as easy to access as an electric power grid the power grid metaphor for accessible computing quickly became canonical when ian foster and carl kesselman published their seminal work the grid blueprint for a new computing infrastructure 2004 cpu scavenging and volunteer computing were popularized beginning in 1997 by distributed net and later in 1999 by seti home to harness the power of networked pcs worldwide in order to solve cpu intensive research problems citation needed the ideas of the grid including those from distributed computing object oriented programming and web services were brought together by ian foster carl kesselman and steve tuecke widely regarded as the fathers of the grid 6 they led the effort to create the globus toolkit incorporating not just computation management but also storage management security provisioning data movement monitoring and a toolkit for developing additional services based on the same infrastructure including agreement negotiation notification mechanisms trigger services and information aggregation while the globus toolkit remains the de facto standard for building grid solutions a number of other tools have been built that answer some subset of services needed to create an enterprise or global grid in 2007 the term cloud computing came into popularity which is conceptually similar to the canonical foster definition of grid computing in terms of computing resources being consumed as electricity is from the power grid indeed grid computing is often but not always associated with the delivery of cloud

quality of service is achieved plaszczak wellner 22 define grid technology as the technology that enables resource virtualization on demand provisioning and service resource sharing between organizations ibm defines grid computing as the ability using a set of open standards and protocols to gain access to applications and data processing power storage capacity and a vast array of other computing resources over the internet a grid is a type of parallel and distributed system that enables the sharing selection and aggregation of resources distributed across multiple administrative domains based on their resources availability capacity performance cost and users quality of service requirements 23 an earlier example of the notion of computing as utility was in 1965 by mit s fernando corbat corbat and the other designers of the multics operating system envisioned a computer facility operating like a power company or water company 24 buyya venugopal 25 define grid as a
