york in the united states 4 it was formed in 1963 by the merger of the institute of radio engineers ire founded 1912 and the american institute of electrical engineers aiee founded 1884 the major interests of the aiee were wire communications telegraphy and telephony and light and power systems the ire concerned mostly radio engineering and was formed from two smaller organizations the society of wireless and telegraph engineers and the wireless institute with the rise of electronics in the 1930s electronics engineers usually became members of the ire but the applications of electron tube technology became so extensive that the technical boundaries differentiating the ire and the aiee became difficult to distinguish after world war ii the two organizations became increasingly competitive and in 1961 the leadership of both the ire and the aiee resolved to consolidate the two organizations the two organizations formally merged as the ieee on january 1 1963 notable presidents of ieee and its founding organizations include elihu thomson aiee 1889 1890 alexander graham bell aiee 1891 1892 charles proteus steinmetz aiee 1901 1902 lee de forest ire 1930 frederick e terman ire 1941 william r hewlett ire 1954 ernst weber ire 1959 ieee 1963 and ivan getting ieee 1978 ieee s constitution defines the purposes of the organization as scientific and educational directed toward the advancement of the theory and practice of electrical electronics communications and computer engineering as well as computer science the allied branches of engineering and the related arts and sciences 1 in pursuing these goals the ieee serves as a major publisher of scientific journals and organizer of conferences workshops and symposia many of which have associated published proceedings it is also a leading standards development organization for the development of industrial standards having developed over 900 active industry technical standards in a broad range of disciplines including electric power and energy biomedical technology and healthcare information technology information assurance telecommunications consumer electronics transportation aerospace and nanotechnology ieee develops and participates in educational activities such as accreditation of electrical engineering programs in institutes of higher learning the ieee logo is a diamond shaped design which illustrates the right hand grip rule embedded in benjamin franklin s kite and it was created at the time of the 1963 merger 5 ieee has a dual complementary regional and technical structure with organizational units based on geography e g the ieee philadelphia section ieee south africa section 1 and technical focus e g the ieee computer society it manages a separate organizational unit ieee usa which recommends policies and implements programs specifically intended to benefit the members the profession and the public in the united states the ieee includes 38 technical societies organized around specialized technical fields with more than 300 local organizations that hold regular meetings the ieee standards association is in charge of the standardization activities of the ieee edit publications main article list of ieee publications ieee produces 30 of the world s literature in the electrical and electronics engineering and computer science fields publishing well over 100 peer reviewed journals 6 the published content in these journals as well as the content from several hundred annual conferences sponsored by the ieee are available in the ieee online digital library for subscription based access and individual publication purchases 7 in addition to journals and conference proceedings the ieee also publishes tutorials and the standards that are produced by its standardization committees edit educational activities picture of the place where an office of ieee works in the district university of bogot colombia the ieee provides learning opportunities within the engineering sciences research and technology the goal of the ieee education programs is to ensure the growth of skill and knowledge in the electricity related technical professions and to foster individual commitment to continuing education among ieee members the engineering and scientific communities and the general public ieee offers educational opportunities such as ieee elearning library 8 the education partners program 9 standards in education 10 and continuing education units ceus 11 ieee elearning library is a collection of online educational courses designed for self paced learning education partners exclusive for ieee members offers on line degree programs certifications and courses at a 10 discount the standards in education website explains what standards are and the importance of developing and using them the site includes tutorial modules and case illustrations to introduce the history of standards the basic terminology their applications and impact on products as well as news related to standards book reviews and links to other sites that contain information on standards currently twenty nine states in the united states require professional development hours pdh to maintain a professional engineering license encouraging engineers to seek continuing education units ceus for their participation in continuing education programs ceus readily translate into professional development hours pdhs with 1 ceu being equivalent to 10 pdhs countries outside the united states such as south africa similarly require continuing professional development cpd credits and it is anticipated that ieee expert now courses will feature in the cpd listing for south africa ieee also sponsors a website 12 designed to help young people understand better what engineering means and how an engineering career can be made part of their future students of age 8 18 parents and teachers can explore the site to prepare for an engineering career ask experts engineering related questions play interactive games explore curriculum links and review lesson plans this website also allows students to search for accredited engineering degree programs in canada and the united states visitors are able to search by state province territory country degree field tuition ranges room and board ranges size of student body and location rural suburban or urban edit standards and development process main article ieee standards association ieee is one of the leading standards making organizations in the world ieee performs its standards making and maintaining functions through the ieee standards association ieee sa ieee standards affect a wide range of industries including power and energy biomedical and healthcare information technology it telecommunications transportation nanotechnology information assurance and many more in 2005 ieee had close to 900 active standards with 500 standards under development one of the more notable ieee standards is the ieee 802 lan man group of standards which includes the ieee 802 3 ethernet standard and the ieee 802 11 wireless networking standard edit membership and member grades most ieee members are electrical and electronics engineers but the organization s wide scope of interests has attracted people in other disciplines as well e g computer science mechanical engineering civil engineering biology physics and mathematics an individual can join the ieee as a student member professional member or associate member in order to qualify for membership the individual must fulfil certain academic or professional criteria and abide to the code of ethics and bylaws of the organization there are several categories and levels of ieee membership and affiliation student members student membership is available for a reduced fee to those who are enrolled in an accredited institution of higher education as undergraduate or graduate students in technology or engineering members ordinary or professional membership requires that the individual have graduated from a technology or engineering program of an appropriately accredited institution of higher education or have demonstrated professional competence in technology or engineering through at least six years of professional work experience an associate membership is available to individuals whose area of expertise

to vote and hold certain offices society affiliates some ieee societies also allow a person who is not an ieee member to become a society affiliate of a particular society within the ieee which allows a limited form of participation in the work of a particular ieee society senior members upon meeting certain requirements a professional member can apply for senior membership which is the highest level of recognition that a professional member can directly apply for applicants for senior member must have at least three letters of recommendation from senior fellow or honorary members and fulfill other rigorous requirements of education achievement remarkable contribution and experience in the field the senior members are a selected group and certain ieee officer positions are available only to senior and fellow members senior membership is also one of the requirements for those who are nominated and elevated to the grade ieee fellow a distinctive honor fellow members the fellow grade of membership is the highest level of membership and cannot be applied for directly by the member instead the candidate must be nominated by others this grade of membership is conferred by the ieee board of directors in recognition of a high level of demonstrated extraordinary accomplishment honorary members individuals who are not ieee members but have demonstrated exceptional contributions such as being a recipient of an ieee medal of honor may receive honorary membership from the ieee board of directors life members and life fellows members who have reached the age of 65 and whose number of years of membership plus their age in years adds up to at least 100 are recognized as life members and in the case of fellow members as life fellows edit awards through its awards program the ieee recognizes contributions that advance the fields of interest to the ieee for nearly a century the ieee awards program has paid tribute to technical professionals whose exceptional achievements and outstanding contributions have made a lasting impact on technology society and the engineering profession funds for the awards program other than those provided by corporate sponsors

foundation the ieee foundation is a charitable foundation established in 1973 to support and promote technology education innovation and excellence 18 it is incorporated separately from the ieee although it has a close relationship to it members of the board of directors of the foundation are required to be active members of ieee and one third of them must be current or former members of the ieee board of directors initially the ieee foundation s role was to accept and administer donations for the ieee awards program but donations increased beyond what was necessary for this purpose and the scope was broadened in addition to soliciting and administering unrestricted funds the foundation also administers donor designated funds supporting particular educational humanitarian historical preservation and peer recognition programs of the ieee 18 as of the end of 2009 the foundation s total assets were 27 million split equally between unrestricted and donor designated funds 19 edit copyright policy the ieee requires authors to transfer their copyright for works they submit for publication 20 21 the ieee generally does not create its own research it is a professional organization that coordinates journal peer review activities and holds subject specific conferences in which authors present their research the ieee then publishes the authors papers in journals and other proceedings and authors are required to give up their exclusive rights to their works 20 section 6 3 1 ieee copyright policies subsections 7 and 8 states that all authors shall transfer to the ieee in writing any copyright they hold for their individual papers but that the ieee will grant the authors permission to make copies and use the papers they originally authored so long as such use is permitted by the board of directors the guidelines for what the board considers a permitted use are not entirely clear although posting a copy on a personally controlled website is allowed the author is also not allowed to change the work absent explicit approval from the organization the ieee justifies this practice in the first paragraph of that section by stating that they will serve and protect the interests of its authors and their employers 20 21 the ieee places research papers and other publications such as ieee standards behind a paywall 20 although the ieee explicitly allows authors to make a copy of the papers that they authored freely available on their own website as of september 2011 the ieee also provides authors for most new journal papers with the option to pay to allow free download of their papers by the public from the ieee publication website 22 ieee publications have received a green 23 rating the from sherpa romeo guide 24 for affirming authors and or their companies shall have the right to post their ieee copyrighted material on their own servers without permission ieee publication policy 8 1 9 d 25 this open access policy effectively allows authors at their choice to make their article openly available roughly 1 3 of the ieee authors take this route citation needed some other professional associations do not impose the same requirements on authors for example the usenix association 20 requires that the author only give up the right to publish the paper elsewhere for 12 months in addition to allowing authors to post copies of the paper on their own website during that time the organization operates successfully even though all of its publications are freely available online 20 edit see also certified software development
