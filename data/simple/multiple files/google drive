between picasa and google drive 6 from 25 gb up to 16 tb through a paid monthly subscription plan 2 49 us per month for 25 gb 7 originally these subscriptions were truly treated as additional storage such that a user with a 25 gb subscription would still retain the free 5 gb for a total of 30 gb however in september 2012 google announced it was cutting the 5 gb of free storage from all paid users accounts so that a user paying for 25 gb would be restricted to precisely 25 gb 8 data storage of files up to 1 gb total in size was introduced on 13 january 2010 but has since been increased to 10 gb documents using google docs native formats do not count towards this quota 9 edit client for google drive to synchronize files on the user s computer in the cloud the google drive client software must be running on the user s computer the client will communicate with the google drive online and ensure that files are synchronized in both locations at launch google drive client software was available for the following devices on pcs running windows xp windows vista and windows 7 or mac os x lion 10 7 and snow leopard 10 6 on android smartphones and tablets with eclair and newer oses android 2 1 on iphones and ipads ios 5 0 10 work on linux client software is underway 11 according to sundar pichai of google the google drive online storage service will be tightly integrated with chrome os version 20 12 there are third party google drive application programs apps that can be installed from the chrome web store these applications running in google chrome operate on the online files and can be used to edit images and videos fax and sign documents manage projects create flowcharts etc 13 edit ownership and licensing google has only one unified terms of service and privacy policy for all its products according to cnet unlike competing services dropbox and skydrive google retains a more broad claim to reproduce use and create derivative works from content stored on the google drive this license is perpetual even after removal of content although the user retains intellectual property rights the broad google drive license allows extraction and parsing of uploaded content to customize advertising and other services that google provides to the user and for promoting the service 14 the broad nature of google s claim to uploaded files also allows for usability improvements such as creating modified versions of uploaded content which are more suitable for various use cases for example transcoding an uploaded video into multiple formats more suitable for viewing on a phone or different web browsers another report from the verge finds that google s terms are quite comparable to those of its competitors and slightly better in some cases 15 edit google docs an example of a document in google docs google docs now housed in google drive is a free web based office suite and data storage service offered by google it allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating in real time with other users google docs combines the features of writely and spreadsheets with a presentation program incorporating technology designed by tonic systems this extension or replacement of google docs called google drive was opened to the public on april 24 2012 edit history writely s beta logo google docs originated from two separate products writely and google spreadsheets writely was a web based word processor created by the software company upstartle and launched in august 2005 16 spreadsheets launched as google labs spreadsheets on june 6 2006 17 originated from the acquisition of the xl2web product by 2web technologies writely s original features included a collaborative text editing suite and access controls menus keyboard shortcuts and dialog boxes are similar to what users may expect in a desktop word processor such as microsoft word or libreoffice writer on march 9 2006 google announced that it had acquired upstartle 18 at the time of acquisition upstartle had four employees 19 writely closed registration to its service until the move to google servers was complete 18 in august 2006 writely sent account invitations to everyone who had requested to be placed on a waiting list and then became publicly available on august 23 writely continued to maintain its own user system until september 19 2006 when it was integrated with google accounts 20 meanwhile google developed google spreadsheets using the technology it had acquired from 2web technologies in 2005 and launched google labs spreadsheets 17 21 on june 6 2006 as the first public component of what would eventually become google docs it was initially made available to only a limited number of users on a first come first served basis the limited test was later replaced with a beta version available to all google account holders around the same time as a press release was issued 22 in february 2007 google docs was made available to google apps users in june 2007 google changed the front page to include folders instead of labels organized in a side bar on september 17 2007 google released their presentation program product for google docs 23 on july 6 2009 google announced on their official blog that google docs along with other google apps would be taken out of beta 24 on january 13 2010 google announced on their official blog that google docs would allow any file type including 1 160 gb of free space and 0 25 gb for additional storage 25 on march 7 2010 docverse an online document collaboration company was acquired by google 26 it allows multiple user online collaboration on microsoft office compatible document formats such as word excel and powerpoint 27 improvements based on docverse were announced and deployed in april 2010 28 in june 2010 it was reported that access to google docs had been blocked in turkey 29 a google employee confirmed the problem saying that it appear ed to be linked to the ongoing ban on youtube 30 as of september 29 2011 google docs supports offline viewing through an opt in beta html 5 web app 31 on april 26 2012 google launched google drive which supplants google docs it combines all of the docs features with improved storage functionality 32 edit features google docs is google s software as a service office suite documents spreadsheets presentations can be created with google docs imported through the web interface or sent via email documents can be saved to a user s local computer in a variety of formats odf html pdf rtf text microsoft office documents are automatically saved to google s servers to prevent data loss and a revision history is automatically kept so past edits may be viewed although this only works for adjacent revisions and there is currently no way to find and isolate changes in long documents documents can be tagged and archived for organizational purposes the service is officially supported on recent versions of the firefox internet explorer safari and chrome browsers running on microsoft windows apple os x linux and chrome operating systems 33 google docs is a tool for real time collaborative editing documents can be shared opened and edited by multiple users at the same time users cannot be notified of changes but the application can notify users when a comment or discussion is made or replied to facilitating collaboration there is no way to highlight changes made by a particular editor in real time during a writing session nor a way to jump to the changes made however users can usually see where in the document or file a particular editor is currently writing since in most of the suite s products an editor s current position is represented with an editor specific color cursor also the revision history included in the service allows users to see the changes made to a document distinguished by editor using their specific color the application supports two iso standard document formats opendocument for both opening and exporting and office open xml for opening only it also includes support for proprietary formats such as doc and xls 34 35 google docs is one of many cloud computing document sharing services 36

microsoft office document versions and allows multiple users to collaborate by working on the same document at the same time 39 40 google spreadsheets and google sites also incorporate google apps script to write code within documents in a similar way to vba in microsoft office the scripts can be activated either by user action or by a trigger in response to an event 41 42 google forms and google drawings have been added to the google docs suite google forms is a tool that allows you to collect information via personalized survey or quiz the information is then collected and automatically connected to a spreadsheet with the same name the spreadsheet is populated with the survey and quiz responses google drawings allows users to collaborate creating sharing and editing images or drawings google drawings contains a subset of the features in google presentation google slides but with different templates offline viewing is available as an opt in beta html 5 web app 31 on may 15 2012 research tool was introduced in google docs 43 it brings the web s wealth of information to the users while they re writing documents edit storage google docs initially provided 1 160 gb of storage for free on april 24 2012 the free storage was increased to 5 gb 44 other aspects of the service were changed at the same time 45 including the price for increased storage amounts was increased and was changed to monthly rather than yearly installments purchased storage was originally shared between gmail picasa and google docs services now it is shared between picasa and google drive only free storage for gmail increased from 7 160 gb to 10 160 gb and is raised to 25 160 gb for accounts with upgraded storage this storage limit is now separate from that of google drive and picasa current monthly rates for increased storage are 2 49 for 25 160 gb 4 99 for 100 160 gb and additional tiers up to 16 160 tb at roughly 0 05 per gb 46 customers who purchased additional storage plans before april 24 2012 are allowed to keep the old rates as long as they maintain service and do not change their plan 45 edit file limits individual documents may not exceed 1 160 gb as of 13 january 2010 160 2010 01 13 update embedded images must not exceed 2 160 mb each and spreadsheets are limited to 256 columns 400 000 cells and 200 sheets 47 in september 2009 an equation editor was

edit data safety and privacy the neutrality of this section is disputed please do not remove this message until the dispute is resolved july 2012 further information cloud computing security 160 and 160 criticism of google in a cloud environment data security issues and national interests mean that on line document storage e g electronic mail and processing e g gmail can be unsuitable for use by governments or commercial organisations especially so where sensitive data e g electronic mail or confidential data is being stored edited or shared on systems and infrastructure that are outsourced e g by senior us government officials to google and shared with many other organisations individuals users e g the internet 50 51 in a mid 2011 attack on google from jinan china a city with a military command center the passwords were stolen for the gmail accounts of hundreds of senior us government officials 50 the gmail address and password would have given the attackers the ability to access other areas of google for these user accounts apps docs etc other systems where the username and password pair were the same could also have been accessed also some systems using a password recovery feature could be accessed if a password is forgotten a new one is sent to the registered email address see password notification email on 10 march 2009 google reported that a bug in google docs had allowed unintended access to some private documents google believed that 0 05 of all documents stored via the service were affected by the bug and claims the issue has now been fixed 51 google has a close relationship with the us intelligence agencies 52 53 and provides information to intelligence agencies 54 around the world upon request via established protocols e g ripa in the uk google is primarily a us company and therefore to protect national interests some non us citizens may have their safety or privacy compromised as a result of using google drive and other google services 54 55 some of the issues that have to be considered to see if google drive is enterprise ready include encryption of data in transit and storage service level agreements regarding electronic discovery and incident management audit trails for users and administrators data segregation and data isolation google provides optional free two factor authentication for greater account security 56 to log in users must provide a short random code sequence sent to their phones via sms or generated by the google authenticator app for android or ios 57 58 in addition google has switched to using secure sockets layer communication https by default preventing common man in the middle attacks 59 60 61 edit mobile access the android google drive app which is available for free on google play 62 allows
