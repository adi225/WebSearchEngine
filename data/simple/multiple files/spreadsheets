a spreadsheet is an interactive computer application program for organization and analysis of information in tabular form spreadsheets developed as computerized simulations of paper accounting worksheets the program operates on data represented as cells of an array organized in rows and columns each cell of the array is a model view controller element that can contain either numeric or text data or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and display a value based on the contents of other cells the user of the spreadsheet can make changes in any stored value and observe the effects on calculated values this makes the spreadsheet useful for what if analysis since many cases can be rapidly investigated without tedious manual recalculation modern spreadsheet software can have multiple interacting sheets and can display data either as text and numerals or in graphical form in addition to the fundamental operations of arithmetic and mathematical functions modern spreadsheets provide built in functions for common financial and statistical operations such calculations as net present value or standard deviation can be applied to tabular data with a pre programmed function in a formula spreadsheet programs also provide conditional expressions functions to convert between text and numbers and functions that operate on strings of text spreadsheets have now replaced paper based systems throughout the business world although they were first developed for accounting or bookkeeping tasks they now are used extensively in any context where tabular lists are built sorted and shared visicalc was the first electronic spreadsheet on a microcomputer and it helped turn the apple ii computer into a popular and widely used system lotus 1 2 3 was the leading

calc spreadsheet a modern spreadsheet file consists of multiple worksheets usually called by the shorter name sheets that make up one workbook with each file being one workbook a cell on one sheet is capable of referencing cells on other different sheets whether within the same workbook or even in some cases in different workbooks spreadsheets share many principles and traits of databases but spreadsheets and databases are not the same thing a spreadsheet is essentially just one table whereas a database is a collection of many tables with machine readable semantic relationships between them while it is true that a workbook that contains three sheets is indeed a file containing multiple tables that can interact with each other it lacks the relational structure of a database spreadsheets and databases are interoperable sheets can be imported into databases to become tables within them and database queries can be exported into spreadsheets for further analysis a spreadsheet program is one of the main components of an office productivity suite which usually also contain a word processor a presentation program and a database management system programs within a suite use similar commands for similar functions usually sharing data between the components is easier than with a non integrated collection of functionally equivalent programs this was particularly an advantage at a time when many personal computer systems used text mode displays and commands instead of a graphical user interface edit history edit paper spreadsheets the word spreadsheet came from spread in its sense of a newspaper or magazine item text and or graphics that covers two facing pages extending across the center fold and treating the two pages as one large one the compound word spread sheet came to mean the format used to present book keeping ledgers with columns for categories of expenditures across the top invoices listed down the left margin and the amount of each payment in the cell where its row and column intersect which were traditionally a spread across facing pages of a bound ledger book for keeping accounting records or on oversized sheets of paper termed analysis paper ruled into rows and columns in that format and approximately twice as wide as ordinary paper edit early implementations edit batch spreadsheet report generator a batch spreadsheet is indistinguishable from a batch compiler with added input data producing an output report i e a 4gl or conventional non interactive batch computer program however this concept of an electronic spreadsheet was outlined in the 1961 paper budgeting models and system simulation by richard mattessich 4 the subsequent work by mattessich 1964a chpt 9 accounting and analytical methods and its companion volume mattessich 1964b simulation of the firm through a budget computer program applied computerized spreadsheets to accounting and budgeting systems on mainframe computers programmed in fortran iv these batch spreadsheets dealt primarily with the addition or subtraction of entire columns or rows of input variables rather than individual cells in 1962 this concept of the spreadsheet called bcl for business computer language was implemented on an ibm 1130 and in 1963 was ported to an ibm 7040 by r brian walsh at marquette university wisconsin this program was written in fortran primitive timesharing was available on those machines in 1968 bcl was ported by walsh to the ibm 360 67 timesharing machine at washington state university it was used to assist in the teaching of finance to business students students were able to take information prepared by the professor and manipulate it to represent it and show ratios etc in 1964 a book entitled business computer language written by kimball stoffells and walsh and both the book and program were copyrighted in 1966 and years later that copyright was renewed 5 in the late 1960s xerox used bcl to develop a more sophisticated version for their timesharing system edit lanpar spreadsheet compiler key invention in the development of electronic spreadsheets was made by rene k pardo and remy landau who filed in 1971 u s patent 4 398 249 on spreadsheet automatic natural order recalculation algorithm in 1970 while the patent was initially rejected by the patent office as being a purely mathematical invention following 12 years of appeals pardo and landau won a landmark court case at the ccpa predecessor court of the federal circuit overturning the patent office in 1983 establishing that something does not cease to become patentable merely because the point of novelty is in an algorithm however in 1995 the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit ruled the patent unenforceable 6 the actual software was called lanpar language for programming arrays at random this was conceived and entirely developed in the summer of 1969 following pardo and landau s recent graduation from harvard university co inventor rene pardo recalls that he felt that one manager at bell canada should not have to depend on programmers to program and modify budgeting forms and he thought of letting users type out forms in any order and having computer calculating results in the right order the software was developed in 1969 7 lanpar was used by bell canada at amp t and the 18 operating telcos nationwide for their local and national budgeting operations lanpar was also used by general motors its uniqueness was the incorporation of natural order recalculation 8 as opposed to left to right top to bottom sequence for calculating the results in each cell that was used by visicalc supercalc and the first version of multiplan without natural order recalculation the users had to manually recalculate the spreadsheet as many times as necessary until the values in all the cells had stopped changing the lanpar system was implemented on ge400 and honeywell 6000 online timesharing systems enabling users to program remotely via computer terminals and modems data could be entered dynamically either by paper tape specific file access on line or even external data bases sophisticated mathematical expressions including logical comparisons and if then statements could be used in any cell and cells could be presented in any order edit autoplan autotab spreadsheet programming language in 1968 three former employees from the general electric computer company headquartered in phoenix arizona set out to start their own software development house a leroy ellison harry n cantrell and russell e edwards found themselves doing a large number of calculations when making tables for the business plans that they were presenting to venture capitalists they decided to save themselves a lot of effort and wrote a computer program that produced their tables for them this program originally conceived as a simple utility for their personal use would turn out to be the first software product offered by the company that would become known as capex corporation autoplan ran on ge s time sharing service afterward a version that ran on ibm mainframes was introduced under the name autotab national css offered a similar product csstab which had a moderate timesharing user base by the early 1970s a major application was opinion research tabulation autoplan autotab was not a wysiwyg interactive spreadsheet program it was a simple scripting language for spreadsheets the user defined the names and labels for the rows and columns then the formulas that defined each row or column edit ibm financial planning and control system the ibm financial planning and control system was developed in 1976 by brian ingham at ibm canada it was implemented by ibm in at least 30 countries it ran on an ibm mainframe and was among the first applications for financial planning developed with apl that completely hid the programming language from the end user through ibm s vm operating system it was among the first programs to auto update each copy of the application as new versions were released users could specify simple mathematical relationships between rows and between columns compared to any contemporary alternatives it could support very large spreadsheets it loaded actual financial data drawn from the legacy batch system into each user s spreadsheet on a monthly basis it was designed to optimize the power of apl through object kernels increasing program efficiency by as much as 50 fold over traditional programming approaches edit apldot modeling language an example of an early industrial weight spreadsheet was apldot developed in 1976 at the united states railway association on an ibm 360 91 running at the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory in laurel md 9 the application was used successfully for many years in developing such applications as financial and costing models for the us congress and for conrail apldot was dubbed a spreadsheet because financial analysts and strategic planners used it to solve the same problems they addressed with paper spreadsheet pads edit visicalc screenshot of visicalc running on an apple ii because of dan bricklin and bob frankston s implementation of visicalc on the apple ii in 1979 and the ibm pc in 1981 the spreadsheet concept became widely known in the late 1970s and early 1980s visicalc was the first spreadsheet that combined all essential features of modern spreadsheet applications such as wysiwyg interactive user interface automatic recalculation status and formula lines range copying with relative and absolute references formula building by selecting referenced cells pc world magazine has called visicalc the first electronic spreadsheet 10 bricklin has spoken of watching his university professor create a table of calculation results on a blackboard when the professor found an error he had to tediously erase and rewrite a number of sequential entries in the table triggering bricklin to think that he could replicate the process on a computer using the blackboard as the model to view results of underlying formulas his idea became visicalc the first application that turned the personal computer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool visicalc went on to become the first killer app 11 12 an application that was so compelling people would buy a particular computer just to use it visicalc was in no small part responsible for the apple ii s success the program was later ported to a number of other early computers notably cp m machines the atari 8 bit family and various commodore platforms nevertheless visicalc remains best known as an apple ii program edit lotus 1 2 3 and other ms dos spreadsheets the acceptance of the ibm pc following its introduction in august 1981 began slowly because most of the programs available for it were translations from other computer models things changed dramatically with the introduction of lotus 1 2 3 in november 1982 and release for sale in january 1983 since it was written especially for the ibm pc it had good performance citation needed and became the killer app for this pc lotus 1 2 3 drove sales of the pc due to the improvements in speed and graphics compared to visicalc on the apple ii lotus 1 2 3 along with its competitor borland quattro soon displaced visicalc lotus 1 2 3 was released on january 26 1983 started outselling then most popular visicalc the very same year and for a number of years was the leading spreadsheet for dos edit microsoft excel microsoft developed excel on the macintosh platform for several years and then ported it to windows 2 0 the windows 3 x platforms of the early 1990s made it possible for excel to take market share from lotus by the time lotus responded with usable windows products microsoft had begun to assemble their office suite starting in the mid 1990s continuing through the present microsoft excel has dominated the commercial electronic spreadsheet market citation needed edit open source software gnumeric is a free cross platform spreadsheet program that is part of the gnome free software desktop

products a number of companies have attempted to break into the spreadsheet market with programs based on very different paradigms lotus introduced what is likely the most successful example lotus improv which saw some commercial success notably in the financial world where its powerful data mining capabilities remain well respected to this day spreadsheet 2000 attempted to dramatically simplify formula construction but was generally not successful edit concepts the main concepts are those of a grid of cells called sheet with either raw data called values or formulas in the cells formulas say how to mechanically compute new values from existing values values are generally numbers but can be also pure text dates months etc extensions of these concepts include logical spreadsheets various tools for programming sheets visualizing data remotely connecting sheets displaying cells dependencies etc are commonly provided edit cells a cell can be thought of as a box for holding data a single cell is usually referenced by its column and row a2 would represent the cell below containing the value 10 usually rows representing the dependant variables are referenced in decimal notation starting from 1 while columns representing the independent variables use 26 adic bijective numeration using the letters a z as numerals its physical size can usually be tailored for its content by dragging its height or width at box intersections or for entire columns or rows by dragging the column or rows headers my spreadsheet a b c d 01 value1 value2 added multiplied 02 10 20 30 200 an array of cells is called a sheet or worksheet it is analogous to an array of variables in a conventional computer program although certain unchanging values once entered could be considered by the same analogy constants in most implementations many worksheets may be located within a single spreadsheet a worksheet is simply a subset of the spreadsheet divided for the sake of clarity functionally the spreadsheet operates as a whole and all cells operate as global variables within the spreadsheet read access only except its own containing cell a cell may contain a value or a formula or it may simply be left empty by convention formulas usually begin with sign edit values a value can be entered from the computer keyboard by directly typing into the cell itself alternatively a value can be based on a formula see below which might perform a calculation display the current date or time or retrieve external data such as a stock quote or a database value the spreadsheet value rule computer scientist alan kay used the term value rule to summarize a spreadsheet s operation a cell s value relies solely on the formula the user has typed into the cell 17 the formula may rely on the value of other cells but those cells are likewise restricted to user entered data or formulas there are no side effects to calculating a formula the only output is to display the calculated result inside its occupying cell there is no natural mechanism for permanently modifying the contents of a cell unless the user manually modifies the cell s contents in the context of programming languages this yields a limited form of first order functional programming 18 edit automatic recalculation a standard of spreadsheets since the mid 1980s citation needed this optional feature eliminates the need to manually request the spreadsheet program to recalculate values nowadays typically the default option unless specifically switched off for large spreadsheets usually to improve performance some earlier spreadsheets required a manual request to recalculate since recalculation of large or complex spreadsheets often reduced data entry speed many modern spreadsheets still retain this option edit real time update this feature refers to updating a cell s contents periodically with a value from an external source such as a cell in a remote spreadsheet for shared web based spreadsheets it applies to immediately updating cells another user has updated all dependent cells must be updated also edit locked cell once entered selected cells or the entire spreadsheet can optionally be locked to prevent accidental overwriting typically this would apply to cells containing formulas but might be applicable to cells containing constants such as a kilogram pounds conversion factor 2 20462262 to eight decimal places even though individual cells are marked as locked the spreadsheet data are not protected until the feature is activated in the file preferences edit data format a cell or range can optionally be defined to specify how the value is displayed the default display format is usually set by its initial content if not specifically previously set so that for example 31 12 2007 or 31 dec 2007 would default to the cell format of date similarly adding a 160 sign after a numeric value would tag the cell as a percentage cell format the cell contents are not changed by this format only the displayed value some cell formats such as numeric or currency can also specify the number of decimal places this can allow invalid operations such as doing multiplication on a cell containing a date resulting in illogical results without an appropriate warning edit cell formatting depending on the capability of the spreadsheet application each cell like its counterpart the style in a word processor can be separately formatted using the attributes of either the content point size color bold or italic or the cell border thickness background shading color to aid the readability of a spreadsheet cell formatting may be conditionally applied to data for example a negative number may be displayed in red a cell s formatting does not typically affect its content and depending on how cells are referenced or copied to other worksheets or applications the formatting may not be carried with the content edit named cells use of named column variables x amp y in microsoft excel formula for y x 2 resembles fortran and name manager shows the definitions of x amp y in most implementations a cell or group of cells in a column or row can be named enabling the user to refer to those cells by a name rather than by a grid reference names must be unique within the spreadsheet but when using multiple sheets in a spreadsheet file an identically named cell range on each sheet can be used if it is distinguished by adding the sheet name one reason for this usage is for creating or running macros that repeat a command across many sheets another reason is that formulas with named variables are readily checked against the algebra they are intended to implement they resemble fortran expressions use of named variables and named functions also makes the spreadsheet structure more transparent edit cell reference in place of a named cell an alternative approach is to use a cell or grid reference most cell references indicate another cell in the same spreadsheet but a cell reference can also refer to a cell in a different sheet within the same spreadsheet or depending on the implementation to a cell in another spreadsheet entirely or to a value from a remote application a typical cell reference in a1 style consists of one or two case insensitive letters to identify the column if there are up to 256 columns a z and aa iv followed by a row number e g in the range 1 65536 either part can be relative it changes when the formula it is in is moved or copied or absolute indicated with in front of the part concerned of the cell reference the alternative r1c1 reference style consists of the letter r the row number the letter c and the column number relative row or column numbers are indicated by enclosing the number in square brackets most current spreadsheets use the a1 style some providing the r1c1 style as a compatibility option when the computer calculates a formula in one cell to update the displayed value of that cell cell reference s in that cell naming some other cell s cause the computer to fetch the value of the named cell s a cell on the same sheet is usually addressed as a1 a cell on a different sheet of the same spreadsheet is usually addressed as sheet2 a1 that is the first cell in sheet 2 of same spreadsheet some spreadsheet implementations allow a cell references to another spreadsheet not the current open and active file on the same computer or a local network it may also refer to a cell in another open and active spreadsheet on the same computer or network that is defined as shareable these references contain the complete filename such as c documents and settings username my spreadsheets main sheet sheet1 a1 in a spreadsheet references to cells automatically update when new rows or columns are inserted or deleted care must be taken however when adding a row immediately before a set of column totals to ensure that the totals reflect the additional rows values which they often do not a circular reference occurs when the formula in one cell refers directly or indirectly through a chain of cell references to another cell that refers back to the first cell many common errors cause circular references however some valid techniques use circular references these techniques after many spreadsheet recalculations usually converge on the correct values for those cells edit cell ranges likewise instead of using a named range of cells a range reference can be used reference to a range of cells is typically of the form a1 a6 which specifies all the cells in the range a1 through to a6 a formula such as sum a1 a6 would add all the cells specified and put the result in the cell containing the formula itself edit sheets in the earliest spreadsheets cells were a simple two dimensional grid over time the model has expanded to include a third dimension and in some cases a series of named grids called sheets the most advanced examples allow inversion and rotation operations which can slice and project the data set in various ways edit formulas animation of a simple spreadsheet that multiplies values in the left column by 2 then sums the calculated values from the right column to the bottom most cell in this example only the values in the a column are entered 10 20 30 and the remainder of cells are formulas formulas in the b column multiply values from the a column using relative references and the formula in b4 uses the sum function to find the sum of values in the b1 b3 range a formula identifies the calculation needed to place the result in the cell it is contained within a cell containing a formula therefore has two display components the formula itself and the resulting value the formula is normally only shown when the cell is selected by clicking the mouse over a particular cell otherwise it contains the result of the calculation a formula assigns values to a cell or range of cells and typically has the format expression where the expression consists of values such as 2 9 14 or 6 67e 11 references to other cells such as e g a1 for a single cell or b1 b3 for a range arithmetic operators such as and others relational operators such as gt lt and others and functions such as sum tan and many others when a cell contains a formula it often contains references to other cells such a cell reference is a type of variable its value is the value of the referenced cell or some derivation of it if that cell in turn references other cells the value depends on the values of those references can be relative e g a1 or b1 b3 absolute e g a 1 or b 1 b 3 or mixed row or column wise absolute relative e g a1 is column wise absolute and a 1 is row wise absolute the available options for valid formulas depends on the particular spreadsheet implementation but in general most arithmetic operations and quite complex nested conditional operations can be performed by most of today s commercial spreadsheets modern implementations also offer functions to access custom build functions remote data and applications a formula may contain a condition or nested conditions with or without an actual calculation and is sometimes used purely to identify and highlight errors in the example below it is assumed the sum of a column of percentages a1 through a6 is tested for validity and an explicit message put into the adjacent right hand cell if sum a1 a6 gt 100 more than 100 sum a1 a6 a spreadsheet does not in fact have to contain any formulas at all in which case it could be considered merely a collection of data arranged in rows and columns a database like a calendar timetable or simple list because of its ease of use formatting and hyperlinking capabilities many spreadsheets are used solely for this purpose edit functions use of user defined function sq x in microsoft excel spreadsheets usually contain a number of supplied functions such as arithmetic operations for example summations averages and so forth trigonometric functions statistical functions and so forth in addition there is often a provision for user defined functions in microsoft excel these functions are defined using visual basic for applications in the supplied visual basic editor and such functions are automatically accessible on the worksheet in addition programs can be written that pull information from the worksheet perform some calculations and report the results back to the worksheet in the figure the name sq is user assigned and function sq is introduced using the visual basic editor supplied with excel name manager displays the spreadsheet definitions of named variables x amp y edit subroutines subroutine in microsoft excel writes values calculated using x into y functions themselves cannot write into the worksheet but simply return their evaluation however in microsoft excel subroutines can write values or text found within the subroutine directly to the spreadsheet the figure shows the visual basic code for a subroutine that reads each member of the named column variable x calculates its square and writes this value into the corresponding element of named column variable y the y column contains no formula because its values are calculated in the subroutine not on the spreadsheet and simply are written in edit remote spreadsheet whenever a reference is made to a cell or group of cells that are not located within the current physical spreadsheet file it is considered as accessing a remote spreadsheet the contents of the referenced cell may be accessed either on first reference with a manual update or more recently in the case of web based spreadsheets as a near real time value with a specified automatic refresh interval edit charts graph made using microsoft excel many spreadsheet applications permit charts graphs or histograms to be generated from specified groups of cells that are dynamically re built as cell contents change the generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet or added as a separate object edit multi dimensional spreadsheets in the late 1980s and early 1990s first javelin software and later lotus improv appeared and unlike models in a conventional spreadsheet they utilized models built on objects called variables not on data in cells of a report these multi dimensional spreadsheets enabled viewing data and algorithms in various self documenting ways including simultaneous multiple synchronized views for example users of javelin could move through the connections between variables on a diagram while seeing the logical roots and branches of each variable this is an example of what is perhaps its primary contribution of the earlier javelin the concept of traceability of a user s logic or model structure through its twelve views a complex model can be dissected and understood by others who had no role in its creation and this remains unique even today javelin was used primarily for financial modeling but was also used to build instructional models in college chemistry courses to model the world s economies and by the military in the early star wars project it is still in use by institutions for which model integrity is mission critical in these programs a time series or any variable was an object in itself not a collection of cells that happen to appear in a row or column variables could have many attributes including complete awareness of their connections to all other variables data references and text and image notes calculations were performed on these objects as opposed to a range of cells so adding two time series automatically aligns them in calendar time or in a user defined time frame data were independent of worksheets variables and therefore data could not be destroyed by deleting a row column or entire worksheet for instance january s costs are subtracted from january s revenues regardless of where or whether either appears in a worksheet this permits actions later used in pivot tables except that flexible manipulation of report tables was but one of many capabilities supported by variables moreover if costs were entered by week and revenues by month javelin s program could allocate or interpolate as appropriate this object design enabled variables and whole models to reference each other with user defined variable names and to perform multidimensional analysis and massive but easily editable consolidations trapeze 14 a spreadsheet on the mac went further and explicitly supported not just table columns but also matrix operators edit logical spreadsheets spreadsheets that have a formula language based upon logical expressions rather than arithmetic expressions are known as logical spreadsheets such spreadsheets can be used to reason deductively about their cell values edit programming issues just as the early programming languages were designed to generate spreadsheet printouts programming techniques themselves have evolved to process tables also known as spreadsheets or matrices of data more efficiently in the computer itself edit end user development spreadsheets are a popular end user development tool 19 eud denotes activities or techniques in which people who are not professional developers create automated behavior and complex data objects without significant knowledge of a programming language many people find it easier to perform calculations in spreadsheets than by writing the equivalent sequential program this is due to several traits of spreadsheets they use spatial relationships to define program relationships humans have highly developed intuitions about spaces and of dependencies between items sequential programming usually requires typing line after line of text which must be read slowly and carefully to be understood and changed they are forgiving allowing partial results and functions to work one or more parts of a program can work correctly even if other parts are unfinished or broken this makes writing and debugging programs much easier and faster citation needed sequential programming usually needs every program line and character to be correct for a program to run one error usually stops the whole program and prevents any result modern spreadsheets allow for secondary notation the program can be annotated with colors typefaces lines etc to provide visual cues about the meaning of elements in the program extensions that allow users to create new functions can provide the capabilities of a functional language 20 edit spreadsheet programs a spreadsheet program is designed to perform general computation tasks using spatial relationships rather than time as the primary organizing principle citation needed it is often convenient to think of a spreadsheet as a mathematical graph where the nodes are spreadsheet cells and the edges are references to other cells specified in formulas this is often called the dependency graph of the spreadsheet references between cells can take advantage of spatial concepts such as relative position and absolute position as well as named locations to make the spreadsheet formulas easier to understand and manage spreadsheets usually attempt to automatically update cells when the cells they depend on change the earliest spreadsheets used simple tactics like evaluating cells in a particular order but modern spreadsheets calculate following a minimal recomputation order from the dependency graph later spreadsheets also include a limited ability to propagate values in reverse altering source values so that a particular answer is reached in a certain cell since spreadsheet cells formulas are not generally invertible though this technique is of somewhat limited value many of the concepts common to sequential programming models have analogues in the spreadsheet world for example the sequential model of the indexed loop is usually represented as a table of cells with similar formulas normally differing only in which cells they reference spreadsheets have evolved to use scripting programming languages like vba as a tool for extensibility beyond what the spreadsheet language makes easy edit shortcomings while spreadsheets are a great step forward in quantitative modeling they have deficiencies at the level of overall user benefits spreadsheets have several main shortcomings especially concerning the unfriendliness of alpha numeric cell addresses systematic study and use of the advanced features of a modern spreadsheet software package can minimize the incidence of these pitfalls research by clusterseven has shown huge discrepancies in the way financial institutions and corporate entities understand manage and police their often vast estates of spreadsheets and unstructured financial data including comma separated variable csv files and microsoft access databases one study in early 2011 of nearly 1 500 people in the uk found that 57 of spreadsheet users have never received formal training on the spreadsheet package they use 72 said that no internal department checks their spreadsheets for accuracy only 13 said that internal audit reviews their spreadsheets while a mere 1 receive checks from their risk department 21 spreadsheets have significant reliability problems research studies estimate that roughly 94 of spreadsheets deployed in the field contain errors and 5 2 of cells in unaudited spreadsheets contain errors 22 despite the high error risks often associated with spreadsheet authorship and use specific steps can be taken to significantly enhance control and reliability by structurally reducing the likelihood of error occurrence at their source 23 the practical expressiveness of spreadsheets can be limited unless their modern features are used several factors contribute to this limitation implementing a complex model on a cell at a time basis requires tedious attention to detail authors have difficulty remembering the meanings of hundreds or thousands of cell addresses that appear in formulas citation needed these drawbacks are mitigated by the use of named variables for cell designations and employing variables in formulas rather than cell locations and cell by cell manipulations graphs can be used to show instantly how results are changed by changes in parameter values in fact the spreadsheet can be made invisible except for a transparent user interface that requests pertinent input from the user displays results requested by the user creates reports and has built in error traps to prompt correct input 24 similarly formulas expressed in terms of cell addresses are hard to keep straight and hard to audit research shows that spreadsheet auditors who check numerical results and cell formulas find no more errors than auditors who only check numerical results 22 that is another reason to use named variables and formulas employing named variables the alteration of a dimension demands major surgery when rows or columns are added to or deleted from a table one has to adjust the size of many downstream tables that depend on the table being changed in the process it is often necessary to move other cells around to make room for the new columns or rows and to adjust graph data sources in large spreadsheets this can be extremely time consuming 25 26 adding or removing a dimension is so difficult one generally has to start over the spreadsheet as a paradigm really forces you to decide on dimensionality right of the beginning of your spreadsheet creation even though it is often most natural to make these choices after your spreadsheet model has matured the desire to add and remove dimensions also arises in parametric and sensitivity analyses 25 26 multi dimensional spreadsheets and tools such as analytica avoid this important pitfall by generalizing the 2 d paradigm of the classical spreadsheet to a multi dimensional representation collaboration in authoring spreadsheet formulas can be difficult when such collaboration occurs at the level of cells and cell addresses however like programming languages spreadsheets are capable of using aggregate cells with similar meaning and indexed variables with names that indicate meaning some spreadsheets have good collaboration features and it is inadvisable to author at the level of cells and cell formulas to avoid obstacles to collaboration where many people cooperate on data entry and many people use the same spreadsheet in collaborative authoring it is advisable to use the range protection feature of spreadsheets that prevents the contents of specific parts of a worksheet from being inadvertently altered other problems associated with spreadsheets include 27 28 some sources advocate the use of specialized software instead of spreadsheets for some applications budgeting statistics 29 30 31 many spreadsheet software products such as microsoft excel 32 versions prior to 2007 and openoffice org calc 33 versions prior to 2008 have a capacity limit of 65 536 rows by 256 columns 2 16 and 2 8 respectively this can present a problem for people using very large datasets and may result in lost data lack of auditing and revision control this makes it difficult to determine who changed what and when this can cause problems with regulatory compliance lack of revision control greatly increases the risk of errors due the inability to track isolate and test changes made to a document lack of security citation needed generally if one has permission to open a spreadsheet one has permission to modify any part of it this is not the case of ms office this combined with the lack of auditing above can make it easy for someone to commit fraud because they are loosely structured it is easy for someone to introduce an error either accidentally or intentionally by entering information in the wrong place or expressing dependencies among cells such as in a formula incorrectly 25 34 35 the results of a formula example a1 b1 applies only to a single cell that is the cell the formula is actually located in in this case perhaps c1 even though it can extract data from many other cells and even real time dates and actual times this means that to cause a similar calculation on an array of cells an almost identical formula but residing in its own output cell must be repeated for each row of the input array this differs from a formula in a conventional computer program which typically makes one calculation that it applies to all the input in turn with current spreadsheets this forced repetition of near identical formulas can have detrimental consequences from a quality assurance standpoint and is often the cause of many spreadsheet errors some spreadsheets have array formulas to address this issue trying to manage the sheer volume of spreadsheets that may exist in an organization without proper security audit trails unintentional introduction of errors and other items listed above can become overwhelming while there are built in and third party tools for desktop spreadsheet applications that address some of these shortcomings awareness and use of these is generally low a good example of this is that 55 of capital market professionals don t know how their spreadsheets are audited only 6 invest in a third party solution 36 edit spreadsheet risk see financial modeling accounting spreadsheet risk is the risk associated with deriving a materially incorrect value from excel or a similar spreadsheet application that will be utilised in making a related usually numerically based decision examples include the valuation of an asset the determination of financial accounts the calculation of medicinal doses or the size of load bearing beam for structural engineering the risk may arise from inputting erroneous or fraudulent data values from mistakes or incorrect changes within the logic of the spreadsheet or the omission of relevant updates e g out of date exchange rates some single instance errors have exceeded us 1 billion 37 38 because spreadsheet risk is principally linked to the actions or inaction of individuals it is defined as a sub category of operational risk edit see also attribute value
