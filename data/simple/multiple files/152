not to be confused with analytics information extraction or data analysis data mining the advanced analysis step of the knowledge discovery in databases process or kdd 1 an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science 2 3 4 is the computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence machine learning statistics and database systems 2 the overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use 2 aside from the raw analysis step it involves database and data management aspects data preprocessing model and inference considerations interestingness metrics complexity considerations post processing of discovered structures visualization and online updating 2 the term is a buzzword and is frequently misused to mean any form of large scale data or information processing collection extraction warehousing analysis and statistics but is also generalized to any kind of computer decision support system including artificial intelligence machine learning and business intelligence in the proper use of the word the key term is discovery commonly defined as detecting something new even the popular book data mining practical machine learning tools and techniques with java 5 which covers mostly machine learning material was originally to be named just practical machine learning and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons 6 often the more general terms large scale data analysis or analytics or when referring to actual methods artificial intelligence and machine learning are more appropriate the actual data mining task is the automatic or semi automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns such as groups of data records cluster analysis unusual records anomaly detection and dependencies association rule mining this usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices these patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data and may be used in further analysis or for example in machine learning and predictive analytics for example the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system neither the data collection data preparation nor result interpretation and reporting are part of the data mining step but do belong to the overall kdd process as additional steps the related terms data dredging data fishing and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are or may be too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered these methods can however be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations contents 1 etymology 2 background 2 1

see also 10 references 11 further reading 12 external links edit etymology in the 1960s statisticians used terms like data fishing or data dredging to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an a priori hypothesis the term data mining appeared around 1990 in the database community at the beginning of the century there was a phrase database mining trademarked by hnc a san diego based company now merged into fico to pitch their data mining workstation 7 researchers consequently turned to data mining other terms used include data archaeology information harvesting information discovery knowledge extraction etc gregory piatetsky shapiro coined the term knowledge discovery in databases for the first workshop on the same topic 1989 and this term became more popular in ai and machine learning community however the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities 8 currently data mining and knowledge discovery are used interchangeably edit background the manual extraction of patterns from data has occurred for centuries early methods of identifying patterns in data include bayes theorem 1700s and regression analysis 1800s the proliferation ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology has dramatically increased data collection storage and manipulation ability as data sets have grown in size and complexity direct hands on data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect automated data processing aided by other discoveries in computer science such as neural networks cluster analysis genetic algorithms 1950s decision trees 1960s and support vector machines 1990s data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns 9 in large data sets it bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence which usually provide the mathematical background to database management by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently allowing such methods to be applied to ever larger data sets edit research and evolution the premier professional body in the field is the association for computing machinery s acm special interest group sig on knowledge discovery and data mining sigkdd since 1989 this acm sig has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings 10 and since 1999 it has published a biannual academic journal titled sigkdd explorations 11 computer science conferences on data mining include cikm conference acm conference on information and knowledge management dmin conference international conference on data mining dmkd conference research issues on data mining and knowledge discovery ecdm conference european conference on data mining ecml pkdd conference european conference on machine learning and principles and practice of knowledge discovery in databases edm conference international

international conference on data mining siam sstd symposium symposium on spatial and temporal databases wsdm conference acm conference on web search and data mining data mining topics are also present on many data management database conferences such as the icde conference sigmod conference and international conference on very large data bases edit process the knowledge discovery in databases kdd process is commonly defined with the stages 1 selection 2 pre processing 3 transformation 4 data mining 5 interpretation evaluation 1 it exists however in many variations on this theme such as the cross industry standard process for data mining crisp dm which defines six phases 1 business understanding 2 data understanding 3 data preparation 4 modeling 5 evaluation 6 deployment or a simplified process such as 1 pre processing 2 data mining and 3 results validation polls conducted in 2002 2004 and 2007 show that the crisp dm methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners 12 13 14 the only other data mining standard named in these polls was semma however 3 4 times as many people reported using crisp dm several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models 15 16 and azevedo and santos conducted a comparison of crisp dm and semma in 2008 17 edit pre processing before data mining algorithms can be used a target data set must be assembled as data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit a common source for data is a data mart or data warehouse pre processing is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before data mining the target set is then cleaned data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data edit data mining data mining involves six common classes of tasks 1 anomaly detection outlier change deviation detection the identification of unusual data records that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation association rule learning dependency modeling searches for relationships between variables for example a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits using association rule learning the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes this is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis clustering is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another similar without using known structures in the data classification is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data for example an e mail program might attempt to classify an e mail as legitimate or as spam regression attempts to find a function which models the data with the least error summarization providing a more compact representation of the data set including visualization and report generation edit results validation this non classification tasks in data mining it only covers machine learning is missing information about section this concern has been noted on the talk page where whether or not to include such information may be discussed september 2011 the final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid it is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set this is called overfitting to overcome this the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained the learned patterns are applied to this test set and the resulting output is compared to the desired output for example a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish spam from legitimate emails would be trained on a training set of sample e mails once trained the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e mails on which it had not been trained the accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e mails they correctly classify a number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm such as roc curves if the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards then it is necessary to re evaluate and change the pre processing and data mining steps if the learned patterns do meet the desired standards then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge edit standards there have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process for example the 1999 european cross industry standard process for data mining crisp dm 1 0 and the 2004 java data mining standard jdm 1 0 development on successors to these processes crisp dm 2 0 and jdm 2 0 was active in 2006 but has stalled since jdm 2 0 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft for exchanging the extracted models in particular for use in predictive analytics 160 the key standard is the predictive model markup language pmml which is an xml based language developed by the data mining group dmg and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications as the name suggests it only covers prediction models a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications however extensions to cover for example subspace clustering have been proposed independently of the dmg 18 edit notable uses see also category applied data mining edit games since the early 1960s with the availability of oracles for certain combinatorial games also called tablebases e g for 3x3 chess with any beginning configuration small board dots and boxes small board hex and certain endgames in chess dots and boxes and hex a new area for data mining has been opened this is the extraction of human usable strategies from these oracles current pattern recognition approaches do not seem to fully acquire the high level of abstraction required to be applied successfully instead extensive experimentation with the tablebases combined with an intensive study of tablebase answers to well designed problems and with knowledge of prior art i e pre tablebase knowledge is used to yield insightful patterns berlekamp in dots and boxes etc and john nunn in chess endgames are notable examples of researchers doing this work though they were not and are not involved in tablebase generation edit business data mining in customer relationship management applications can contribute significantly to the bottom line citation needed rather than randomly contacting a prospect or customer through a call center or sending mail a company can concentrate its efforts on prospects that are predicted to have a high likelihood of responding to an offer more sophisticated methods may be used to optimize resources across campaigns so that one may predict to which channel and to which offer an individual is most likely to respond across all potential offers additionally sophisticated applications could be used to automate mailing once the results from data mining potential prospect customer and channel offer are determined this sophisticated application can either automatically send an e mail or a regular mail finally in cases where many people will take an action without an offer uplift modeling can be used to determine which people have the greatest increase in response if given an offer uplift modeling thereby enables marketers to focus mailings and offers on persuadable people and not to send offers to people who will buy the product without an offer data clustering can also be used to automatically discover the segments or groups within a customer data set businesses employing data mining may see a return on investment but also they recognize that the number of predictive models can quickly become very large rather than using one model to predict how many customers will churn a business could build a separate model for each region and customer type then instead of sending an offer to all people that are likely to churn it may only want to send offers to loyal customers finally the business may want to determine which customers are going to be profitable over a certain window in time and only send the offers to those that are likely to be profitable in order to maintain this quantity of models they need to manage model versions and move on to automated data mining data mining can also be helpful to human resources hr departments in identifying the characteristics of their most successful employees information obtained such as universities attended by highly successful employees can help hr focus recruiting efforts accordingly additionally strategic enterprise management applications help a company translate corporate level goals such as profit and margin share targets into operational decisions such as production plans and workforce levels 19 another example of data mining often called the market basket analysis relates to its use in retail sales if a clothing store records the purchases of customers a data mining system could identify those customers who favor silk shirts over cotton ones although some explanations of relationships may be difficult taking advantage of it is easier the example deals with association rules within transaction based data not all data are transaction based and logical or inexact rules may also be present within a database market basket analysis has also been used to identify the purchase patterns of the alpha consumer alpha consumers are people that play a key role in connecting with the concept behind a product then adopting that product and finally validating it for the rest of society analyzing the data collected on this type of user has allowed companies to predict future buying trends and forecast supply demands citation needed data mining is a highly effective tool in the catalog marketing industry citation needed catalogers have a rich database of history of their customer transactions for millions of customers dating back a number of years data mining tools can identify patterns among customers and help identify the most likely customers to respond to upcoming mailing campaigns data mining for business applications is a component that needs to be integrated into a complex modeling and decision making process reactive business intelligence rbi advocates a holistic approach that integrates data mining modeling and interactive visualization into an end to end discovery and continuous innovation process powered by human and automated learning 20 in the area of decision making the rbi approach has been used to mine knowledge that is progressively acquired from the decision maker and then self tune the decision method accordingly 21 an example of data mining related to an integrated circuit ic production line is described in the paper mining ic test data to optimize vlsi testing 22 in this paper the application of data mining and decision analysis to the problem of die level functional testing is described experiments mentioned demonstrate the ability to apply a system of mining historical die test data to create a probabilistic model of patterns of die failure these patterns are then utilized to decide in real time which die to test next and when to stop testing this system has been shown based on experiments with historical test data to have the potential to improve profits on mature ic products edit science and engineering in recent years data mining has been used widely in the areas of science and engineering such as bioinformatics genetics medicine education and electrical power engineering in the study of human genetics sequence mining helps address the important goal of understanding the mapping relationship between the inter individual variations in human dna sequence and the variability in disease susceptibility in simple terms it aims to find out how the changes in an individual s dna sequence affects the risks of developing common diseases such as cancer which is of great importance to improving methods of diagnosing preventing and treating these diseases the data mining method that is used to perform this task is known as multifactor dimensionality reduction 23 in the area of electrical power engineering data mining methods have been widely used for condition monitoring of high voltage electrical equipment the purpose of condition monitoring is to obtain valuable information on for example the status of the insulation or other important safety related parameters data clustering techniques such as the self organizing map som have been applied to vibration monitoring and analysis of transformer on load tap changers oltcs using vibration monitoring it can be observed that each tap change operation generates a signal that contains information about the condition of the tap changer contacts and the drive mechanisms obviously different tap positions will generate different signals however there was considerable variability amongst normal condition signals for exactly the same tap position som has been applied to detect abnormal conditions and to hypothesize about the nature of the abnormalities 24 data mining methods have also been applied to dissolved gas analysis dga in power transformers dga as a diagnostics for power transformers has been available for many years methods such as som has been applied to analyze generated data and to determine trends which are not obvious to the standard dga ratio methods such as duval triangle 24 another example of data mining in science and engineering is found in educational research where data mining has been used to study the factors leading students to choose to engage in behaviors which reduce their learning 25 and to understand factors influencing university student retention 26 a similar example of social application of data mining is its use in expertise finding systems whereby descriptors of human expertise are extracted normalized and classified so as to facilitate the finding of experts particularly in scientific and technical fields in this way data mining can facilitate institutional memory other examples of application of data mining methods are biomedical data facilitated by domain ontologies 27 mining clinical trial data 28 and traffic analysis using som 29 in adverse drug reaction surveillance the uppsala monitoring centre has since 1998 used data mining methods to routinely screen for reporting patterns indicative of emerging drug safety issues in the who global database of 4 6 160 million suspected adverse drug reaction incidents 30 recently similar methodology has been developed to mine large collections of electronic health records for temporal patterns associating drug prescriptions to medical diagnoses 31 data mining has been applied software artifacts within the realm of software engineering mining software repositories edit human rights data mining of government records particularly records of the justice system i e courts prisons enables the discovery of systemic human rights violations in connection to generation and publication of invalid or fraudulent legal records by various government agencies 32 33 edit medical data mining in 2011 the case of sorrell v ims health inc decided by the supreme court of the united states ruled that pharmacies may share information with outside companies this practice was authorized under the 1st amendment of the constitution protecting the freedom of speech 34 edit spatial data mining spatial data mining is the application of data mining methods to spatial data the end objective of spatial data mining is to find patterns in data with respect to geography so far data mining and geographic information systems gis have existed as two separate technologies each with its own methods traditions and approaches to visualization and data analysis particularly most contemporary gis have only very basic spatial analysis functionality the immense explosion in geographically referenced data occasioned by developments in it digital mapping remote sensing and the global diffusion of gis emphasizes the importance of developing data driven inductive approaches to geographical analysis and modeling data mining offers great potential benefits for gis based applied decision making recently the task of integrating these two technologies has become of critical importance especially as various public and private sector organizations possessing huge databases with thematic and geographically referenced data begin to realize the huge potential of the information contained therein among those organizations are offices requiring analysis or dissemination of geo referenced statistical data public health services searching for explanations of disease clustering environmental agencies assessing the impact of changing land use patterns on climate change geo marketing companies doing customer segmentation based on spatial location challenges in spatial mining geospatial data repositories tend to be very large moreover existing gis datasets are often splintered into feature and attribute components that are conventionally archived in hybrid data management systems algorithmic requirements differ substantially for relational attribute data management and for topological feature data management 35 related to this is the range and diversity of geographic data formats which present unique challenges the digital geographic data revolution is creating new types of data formats beyond the traditional vector and raster formats geographic data repositories increasingly include ill structured data such as imagery and geo referenced multi media 36 there are several critical research challenges in geographic knowledge discovery and data mining miller and han 37 offer the following list of emerging research topics in the field developing and supporting geographic data warehouses gdw s spatial properties are often reduced to simple aspatial attributes in mainstream data warehouses creating an integrated gdw requires solving issues of spatial and temporal data interoperability including differences in semantics referencing systems geometry accuracy and position better spatio temporal representations in geographic knowledge discovery current geographic knowledge discovery gkd methods generally use very simple representations of geographic objects and spatial relationships geographic data mining methods should recognize more complex geographic objects i e lines and polygons and relationships i e non euclidean distances direction connectivity and interaction through attributed geographic space such as terrain furthermore the time dimension needs to be more fully integrated into these geographic representations and relationships geographic knowledge discovery using diverse data types gkd methods should be developed that can handle diverse data types beyond the traditional raster and vector models including imagery and geo referenced multimedia as well as dynamic data types video streams animation edit sensor data mining wireless sensor networks can be used for facilitating the collection of data for spatial data mining for a variety of applications such as air pollution monitoring 38 a characteristic of such networks is that nearby sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values this kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires the techniques for in network data aggregation and mining by measuring the spatial correlation between data sampled by different sensors a wide class of specialized algorithms can be developed to develop more efficient spatial data mining algorithms 39 edit visual data mining in the process of turning from analogical into digital large data sets have been generated collected and stored discovering statistical patterns trends and information which is hidden in data in order to build predictive patterns studies suggest visual data mining is faster and much more intuitive than is traditional data mining 40 41 edit music data mining data mining techniques and in particular co occurrence analysis has been used to discover relevant similarities among music corpora radio lists cd databases for the purpose of classifying music into genres in a more objective manner 42 edit surveillance data mining has been used to stop terrorist programs under the u s government including the total information awareness tia program secure flight formerly known as computer assisted passenger prescreening system capps ii analysis dissemination visualization insight semantic enhancement advise 43 and the multi state anti terrorism information exchange matrix 44 these programs have been discontinued due to controversy over whether they violate the 4th amendment to the united states constitution although many programs that were formed under them continue to be funded by different organizations or under different names 45 in the context of combating terrorism two particularly plausible methods of data mining are pattern mining and subject based data mining edit pattern mining pattern mining is a data mining method that involves finding existing patterns in data in this context patterns often means association rules the original motivation for searching association rules came from the desire to analyze supermarket transaction data that is to examine customer behavior in terms of the purchased products for example an association rule beer potato chips 80 states that four out of five customers that bought beer also bought potato chips in the context of pattern mining as a tool to identify terrorist activity the national research council provides the following definition pattern based data mining looks for patterns including anomalous data patterns that might be associated with terrorist activity 160 these patterns might be regarded as small signals in a large ocean of noise 46 47 48 pattern mining includes new areas such a music information retrieval mir where patterns seen both in the temporal and non temporal domains are imported to classical knowledge discovery search methods edit subject based data mining subject based data mining is a data mining method involving the search for associations between individuals in data in the context of combating terrorism the national research council provides the following definition subject based data mining uses an initiating individual or other datum that is considered based on other information to be of high interest and the goal is to determine what other persons or financial transactions or movements etc are related to that initiating datum 47 edit knowledge grid knowledge discovery on the grid generally refers to conducting knowledge discovery in an open environment using grid computing concepts allowing users to integrate data from various online data sources as well make use of remote resources for executing their data mining tasks the earliest example was the discovery net 49 50 developed at imperial college london which won the most innovative data intensive application award at the acm sc02 supercomputing 2002 conference and exhibition based on a demonstration of a fully interactive distributed knowledge discovery application for a bioinformatics application other examples include work conducted by researchers at the university of calabria who developed a knowledge grid architecture for distributed knowledge discovery based on grid computing 51 52 edit reliability validity data mining can be misused and can also unintentionally produce results which appear significant but which do not actually predict future behavior and cannot be reproduced on a new sample of data see data snooping data dredging edit privacy concerns and ethics some people believe that data mining itself is ethically neutral 53 while the term data mining has no ethical implications it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to peoples behavior ethical and otherwise to be precise data mining is a statistical method that is applied to a set of information i e a data set associating these data sets with people is an extreme narrowing of the types of data that are available examples could range from a set of crash test data for passenger vehicles to the performance of a group of stocks these types of data sets make up a great proportion of the information available to be acted on by data mining methods and rarely have ethical concerns associated with them however the ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding privacy legality and ethics 54 in particular data mining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes such as in the total information awareness program or in advise has raised privacy concerns 55 56 data mining requires data preparation which can uncover information or patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations a common way for this to occur is through data aggregation data aggregation involves combining data together possibly from various sources in a way that facilitates analysis but that also might make identification of private individual level data deducible or otherwise apparent 57 this is not data mining per se but a result of the preparation of data before and for the purposes of the analysis the threat to an individual s privacy comes into play when the data once compiled cause the data miner or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set to be able to identify specific individuals especially when the data were originally anonymous it is recommended that an individual is made aware of the following before data are collected 57 the purpose of the data collection and any known data mining projects how the data will be used who will be able to mine the data and use the data and their derivatives the status of security surrounding access to the data how collected data can be updated in america privacy concerns have been addressed to some extent by the us congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the hipaa requires individuals to give their informed consent regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses according to an article in biotech business week i n practice hipaa may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena says the aahc more importantly the rule s goal of protection through informed consent is undermined by the complexity of consent forms that are required of patients and participants which approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals 58 this underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices data may also be modified so as to become anonymous so that individuals may not readily be identified 57 however even de identified anonymized data sets can potentially contain enough information to allow identification of individuals as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by aol 59 edit software see also category data mining and machine learning
