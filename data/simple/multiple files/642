analysis is a popular suite of machine learning software written in java developed at the university of waikato new zealand weka is free software available under the gnu general public license contents 1 description 2 arff file 3 history 4 see also 5 references 6 external links edit description the weka logo the weka is a bird endemic to new zealand the weka workbench 1 contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to this functionality the original non java version of weka was a tcl tk front end to mostly third party modeling algorithms implemented in other programming languages plus data preprocessing utilities in c and a makefile based system for running machine learning experiments this original version was primarily designed as a tool for analyzing data from agricultural domains 2 3 but the more recent fully java based version weka 3 for which development started in 1997 is now used in many different application areas in particular for educational purposes and research advantages of weka include free availability under the gnu general public license portability since it is fully implemented in the java programming language and thus runs on almost any modern computing platform a comprehensive collection of data preprocessing and modeling techniques ease of use due to its graphical user interfaces weka supports several standard data mining tasks more specifically data preprocessing clustering classification regression visualization and feature selection all of weka s techniques are predicated on the assumption that the data is available as a single flat file or relation where each data point is described by a fixed number of attributes normally numeric or nominal attributes but some other attribute types are also supported weka provides access to sql databases using java database connectivity and can process the result returned by a database query it is not capable of multi relational data mining but there is separate software for converting a collection of linked database tables into a single table that is suitable for processing using weka 4 another important area that is currently not covered by the algorithms included in the weka distribution is sequence modeling weka s main user interface is the explorer but essentially the same functionality can be accessed through the component based knowledge flow interface and from the command line there is also the experimenter which allows the systematic comparison of the predictive performance of weka s machine learning algorithms on a collection of datasets the explorer interface features several panels providing access to the main components of the workbench the preprocess panel has facilities for importing data from a database a csv file etc and for preprocessing this data using a so called filtering algorithm these filters can be used to transform the data e g turning numeric attributes into discrete ones and make it possible to delete instances and attributes according to specific criteria the classify panel enables the user to apply classification and regression algorithms indiscriminately called classifiers in weka to the resulting dataset to estimate the accuracy of the resulting predictive model and to visualize erroneous predictions roc curves etc or the model itself if the model is amenable to visualization like e g a decision tree the associate panel provides access to association rule learners that attempt to identify all important interrelationships between attributes in the data the cluster panel gives access to the clustering techniques in weka e g the simple k means algorithm there is also an implementation of the expectation maximization algorithm for learning a mixture of normal distributions the select attributes panel provides algorithms for identifying the most predictive attributes in a dataset the visualize panel shows a scatter plot matrix where individual scatter plots can be selected and enlarged and analyzed further using various selection operators edit arff file attribute relationship file format arff is the text format file used by weka to store data in a database this kind of file is structured as follows weather relational database relation weather attribute outlook sunny overcast rainy attribute temperature real attribute humidity real attribute windy true false attribute play yes no the arff file contains two sections the header and the data section the first line of the header tells us the relation name then there is the list of the attributes attribute each attribute is associated with a unique name and a type the latter describes the kind of data contained in the variable and what values it can have the variables types are numeric nominal string and date the class attribute is by default the last one of the list in the header section there can also be some comment lines identified with a at the beginning which can describe the database content or give the reader information about the author after that there is the data itself data each line stores the attribute of a single entry separated by a comma 5 edit history in 1993 the university of waikato in new zealand started development of the original version of weka which became a mixture of tcl tk c and makefiles in 1997 the decision was made to redevelop weka from scratch in java including implementations of modeling algorithms 6 in 2005 weka received the sigkdd data mining and knowledge discovery service award 7 8 in 2006 pentaho corporation acquired an exclusive licence to use weka for business intelligence it forms the data mining and predictive analytics component of the pentaho business intelligence suite all time ranking on sourceforge net as of 2011 08 26 243 with 2 487 213 downloads edit see also free software portal rapidminer formerly
