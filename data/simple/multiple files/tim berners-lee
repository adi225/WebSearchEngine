berners lee worked as an independent contractor at cern from june to december 1980 while there he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers 15 to demonstrate he built a prototype system named enquire 16 after leaving cern in late 1980 he went to work at john poole s image computer systems ltd in bournemouth england 17 he ran the company s technical side for three years 18 the project he worked on was a real time remote procedure call which gave him experience in computer networking 17 in 1984 he returned to cern as a fellow 16 in 1989 cern was the largest internet node in europe and berners lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the internet i just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the transmission control protocol and domain name system ideas and ta da the world wide web 19 creating the web was really an act of desperation because the situation without it was very difficult when i was working at cern later most of the technology involved in the web like the hypertext like the internet multifont text objects had all been designed already i just had to put them together it was a step of generalising going to a higher level of abstraction thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system 20 berners lee wrote his initial proposal in march 1989 and in 1990 with the help of robert cailliau with whom he shared the 1995 acm software system award produced a revision which was accepted by his manager mike sendall 21 he used similar ideas to those underlying the enquire system to create the world wide web for which he designed and built the first web browser this also functioned as an editor worldwideweb running on the nextstep operating system and the first web server cern httpd short for hypertext transfer protocol daemon mike sendall buys a next cube for evaluation and gives it to tim berners lee tim s prototype implementation on nextstep is made in the space of a few months thanks to the qualities of the nextstep software development system this prototype offers wysiwyg browsing authoring current web browsers used in surfing the internet are mere passive windows depriving the user of the possibility to contribute during some sessions in the cern cafeteria tim and i try to find a catching name for the system i was determined that the name should not yet again be taken from greek mythology tim proposes world wide web i like this very much except that it is difficult to pronounce in french by robert cailliau 2 november 1995 22 the first website built was at cern within the border of france 23 and was first put online on 6 august 1991 info cern ch was the address of the world s first ever web site and web server running on a next computer at cern the first web page address was http info cern ch hypertext www theproject html which centred on information regarding the www project visitors could learn more about hypertext technical details for creating their own webpage and even an explanation on how to search the web for information there are no screenshots of this original page and in any case changes were made daily to the information available on the page as the www project developed you may find a later copy 1992 on the world wide web consortium website
