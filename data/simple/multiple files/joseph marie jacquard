jacquard s surname was not technically jacquard it was charles in his grandfather s generation several branches of the charles family lived in lyon s couzon au mont d or suburb on lyon s north side along the sa ne river to distinguish the various branches they were given nicknames joseph s branch was dubbed the jacquard charles thus joseph s grandfather was barth lemy charles dit called jacquard 1 2 joseph marie charles dit jacquard was born in lyon france on 7 july 1752 he was one of nine children of jean charles dit jacquard a master weaver of lyon and his wife antoinette rive however only joseph and his sister cl mence born 7 november 1747 survived to adulthood although his father was a man of property joseph received no formal schooling and remained illiterate until he was 13 he was finally taught by his brother in law jean marie barret who ran a printing and bookselling business barret also introduced joseph to learned societies and scholars 3 his mother died in 1762 and when his father died in 1772 joseph inherited his father s house looms and workshop as well as a vineyard and quarry in couzon au mont d or joseph then dabbled in real estate in 1778 he listed his occupations as master weaver and silk merchant 3 jacquard s occupation at this time is problematic because by 1780 most silk weavers did not work independently instead they worked for wages from silk merchants and jacquard was not registered as a silk merchant in lyon 4 there is some confusion about jacquard s early work history british economist sir john bowring met jacquard who told bowring that at one time he had been a maker of straw hats 5 eymard claimed that before becoming involved in the weaving of silk jacquard was a type founder a maker of printers type a soldier a bleacher blanchisseur of straw hats and a lime burner a maker of lime for mortar 6 barlow claims that before marrying jacquard had worked for a bookbinder a type founder and a maker of cutlery after marrying jacquard tried cutlery making type founding and weaving 7 however barlow does not cite any sources for that information ballot stated that jacquard initially helped his father operate his loom but the work proved too arduous so jacquard was placed first with a bookbinder and then with a maker of printers type 8 on 26 july 1778 joseph married claudine boichon she was a middle class widow from lyon who owned property and had a substantial dowry however joseph soon fell deeply into debt and was brought to court barlow claims that after jacquard s father died jacquard started a figure weaving business but failed and lost all his wealth however barlow cites no sources to support his claim 7 to settle his debts he was obliged to sell his inheritance and to appropriate his wife s dowry fortunately his wife retained a house in oullins on lyon s south side along the rhone river where the couple resided on 19 april 1779 the couple had their only child a son jean marie 3 beyond his name and his date of birth nothing is known about jacquard s son charles ballot stated that after the rebellion of lyon in 1793 was suppressed jacquard and his son escaped from the city by joining the revolutionary army they fought together in the rhine campaign of 1795 serving in the rhone and loire battalion under general jean charles pichegru jacquard s son was killed outside of heidelberg however ballot repeated rumors and was a sloppy historian for example he stated that jacquard s wife claudette boichon was the daughter of antoine h lon boichon a master swordsmith whereas claudette was a widow who had been married to a mr boichon before she married jacquard 9 by 1800 joseph began to dabble in inventing a treadle loom in 1800 a loom to weave fishing nets in 1803 and starting in 1804 the jacquard loom which would weave patterned silk automatically however none of his inventions operated well and thus were unsuccessful 4 in 1801 jacquard exhibited his invention at the industrial exhibition in paris and in 1803 he was summoned to paris and attached to the conservatoire des arts et metiers a loom by jacques de vaucanson on display there suggested various improvements in his own which he gradually perfected to its final state although his invention was fiercely opposed by the silk weavers who feared that its introduction owing to the saving of labour would deprive them of their livelihood its advantages secured its general adoption and by 1812 there were 11 000 jacquard looms in use in france this claim has been challenged initially few jacquard looms were sold because of problems with the punched card mechanism only after 1815 after jean antoine breton had solved the problems with the punched card mechanism did sales of looms increase 10 11 12 the loom was declared public property in 1806 and jacquard was rewarded with a pension and a royalty on each machine jacquard died at oullins rh ne 7 august 1834 13 six years later a statue was erected to him in lyon on the site where his 1801 exhibit loom was destroyed edit jacquard loom main article jacquard loom jacquard loom on display museum of science and industry in manchester england the jacquard loom is a mechanical loom that has holes punched in pasteboard each row of which corresponds to one row of the design multiple rows of holes are punched on each card and the many cards that compose the design of the textile are strung together in order it is based on earlier inventions by the frenchmen basile bouchon 1725 jean baptiste falcon 1728 and jacques vaucanson 1740 14 in order to discuss the jacquard loom some basic knowledge of weaving is necessary in order to make a strip of cloth parallel threads the warp are stretched across a rectangular frame to make a plain piece of cloth every other warp thread is raised slightly a thread the weft thread is then passed at a right angle to the warp through the space the shed between the lower and the upper warp threads the raised warp threads are then lowered and the previously lower warp threads are raised and the weft thread is then passed through the shed in the opposite direction the process can then be repeated indefinitely the most famous image in the early history of computing 15 this portrait of jacquard was woven in silk on a jacquard loom and required 24 000 punched cards to create 1839 it was only produced to order charles babbage owned one of these portraits it inspired him in using perforated cards in his analytical engine 16 it is in the collection of the science museum in london england 4 however by raising different warp threads during weaving it is possible to make fabrics of different textures or to vary the texture or even the color of the cloth in order to create patterns or designs when elaborate patterns or designs were to be woven manually selecting the warp threads that were to be raised became a slow complicated procedure that was subject to error jacquard s loom was intended to automate this process jacquard was not the first man to try to automate the process of weaving in 1725 basile bouchon invented an attachment for draw looms which used a broad strip of punched paper to select the warp threads that would be raised during weaving 17 specifically bouchon s innovation involved a row of hooks the curved portion of each hook snagged a string that could raise one of the warp threads whereas the straight portion of each hook pressed against the punched paper which was draped around a perforated cylinder whenever the hook pressed against the solid paper pushing the cylinder forward would raise the corresponding warp thread whereas whenever the hook met a hole in the paper pushing the cylinder forward would allow the hook to slip inside the cylinder and the corresponding warp thread would not be raised bouchon s loom was unsuccessful because it could handle only a modest number of warp threads 18 19 by 1737 a master silk weaver of lyon jean falcon had increased the number of warp threads that the loom could handle automatically he developed an attachment for looms in which bouchon s paper strip was replaced by a chain of punched cards which could deflect multiple rows of hooks simultaneously like bouchon falcon used a cylinder actually a four sided perforated tube to hold each card in place while it was pressed against the rows of hooks 20 his loom was modestly successful about 40 such looms had been sold by 1762 21 in 1741 jacques de vaucanson a french inventor who designed and built automated mechanical toys was appointed inspector of silk factories 22 between 1747 and 1750 23 he tried to automate bouchon s mechanism in vaucanson s mechanism the hooks that were to lift the warp threads were selected by long pins or needles which were pressed against a sheet of punched paper that was draped around a perforated cylinder specifically each hook passed at a right angle through an eyelet of a needle when the cylinder was pressed against the array of needles some of the needles pressing against solid paper would move forward which in turn would tilt the corresponding hooks the hooks that were tilted would not be raised so the warp threads that were snagged by those hooks would remain in place however the hooks that were not tilted would be raised and the warp threads that were snagged by those hooks would also be raised by placing his mechanism above the loom vaucanson eliminated the complicated system of weights and cords tail cords simple pulley box etc that had been used to select which warp threads were to be raised during weaving vaucanson also added a ratchet mechanism to advance the punched paper each time that the cylinder was pushed against the row of hooks 24 25 26 27 however vaucanson s loom was not successful its mechanism was not successful probably because like bouchon s mechanism it could not control enough warp threads and hence it could not weave patterns that were sufficiently elaborate to justify the cost of the mechanism 23 in order to stimulate the french textile industry which was competing with britain s industrialized textile industry napoleon bonaparte placed large orders for lyon s silk starting in 1802 12 in 1804 28 at the urging of lyon silk merchant gabriel detilleu jacquard studied vaucanson s loom which was stored at the conservatoire des arts et m tiers in paris 4 by 1805 jacquard had eliminated the paper strip from vaucanson s mechanism and returned to using falcon s chain of punched cards 29 the potential of jacquard s loom was immediately recognized on april 12 1805 emperor napoleon and empress josephine visited lyon and during their tour they viewed jacquard s new loom on april 15 1805 the emperor granted the patent for jacquard s loom to the city of lyon in return jacquard received a lifelong pension of 3 000 francs furthermore he received a royalty of 50 francs for each loom that was bought and used during the period from 1805 through 1811 12
