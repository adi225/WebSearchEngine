uplift modelling also known as incremental modelling true lift modelling or net modelling is a predictive modelling technique that directly models the incremental impact of a treatment such as a direct marketing action on an individual s behaviour uplift modelling has applications in customer relationship management for up sell cross sell and retention modelling it has also been applied to

not only measure the effectiveness of a marketing action but also to build a predictive model that predicts the incremental response to the marketing action it is a data mining technique that has been applied predominantly in the financial services telecommunications and retail direct marketing industries to up sell cross sell churn and retention activities edit measuring uplift the uplift of a marketing campaign is usually defined as the difference in response rate between a treated group and a randomized control group this allows a marketing team to isolate the effect of a marketing action and measure the effectiveness or otherwise of that individual marketing action honest marketing teams will only take credit for the incremental effect of their campaign the table below shows the details of a campaign showing the number of responses and calculated response rate for a hypothetical marketing campaign this campaign would be defined as having a response rate uplift of 5 it has created 50 000 incremental responses 100 000 50 000 group number of customers responses response rate treated 1 000 000 100 000 10 control 1 000 000 50 000 5 edit traditional response modelling traditional response modelling typically takes a group of treated customers and attempts to build a predictive model that separates the likely responders from the non responders through the use of one of a number of predictive modelling techniques typically this would use decision trees or regression analysis this model would only use the treated customers to build the model edit uplift modelling in contrast uplift modelling uses both the treated and control customers to build a predictive model that focuses on the incremental response to understand this type of model it is proposed that there is a fundamental segmentation that separates customers into the following groups the persuadables 160 customers who only respond to the marketing action because they were targeted the sure things 160 customers who would have responded whether they were targeted or not the lost causes 160 customers who will not respond irrespective of whether or not they are targeted the do not disturbs or sleeping dogs 160 customers who are less likely to respond because they were targeted the only segment that provides true incremental responses is the persuadables uplift modelling provides a scoring technique that can separate customers into the groups described above traditional response modelling often targets the sure things being unable to distinguish them from the persuadables edit return on investment because uplift modelling focuses on incremental responses only it provides very strong return on investment cases when applied to traditional demand generation and retention activities for example by only targeting the persuadable customers in an outbound marketing campaign the contact costs and hence the return per unit spend can be dramatically improved edit removal of negative effects one of the most effective uses of uplift modelling is in the removal of negative effects from retention campaigns both in the telecommunications and financial services industries often retention campaigns can trigger customers to cancel a contract or policy uplift modelling allows these customers the do not disturbs to be removed from the campaign edit application to a b and multivariate testing it is rarely the case that there is a single treatment and control group often the treatment can be a variety of simple variations of a message or a multi stage contact strategy that is classed as a single treatment in the case of a b or multivariate testing uplift modelling can help in understanding whether the variations in tests provide any significant uplift compared to other targeting criteria such as behavioural or demographic indicators edit history of uplift modelling the first appearance of true response modelling appears to be in the work of radcliffe and surry
