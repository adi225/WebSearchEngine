semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding searcher intent and the contextual meaning of terms as they appear in the searchable dataspace whether on the web or within a closed system to generate more relevant results author seth grimes lists 11 approaches that join semantics to search and hildebrand et al provide an overview that lists semantic search systems and identifies other uses of semantics in the search process 1 semantic search systems consider various points including context of search location intent variation of words synonyms generalized and specialized queries concept matching and natural language queries to provide relevant search results 2 major web search engines like google and bing incorporate some elements of semantic search guha et al distinguish two major forms of search navigational and research 3 in navigational search the user is using the search engine as a navigation tool to navigate to a particular intended document semantic search is not applicable to navigational searches in research search the user provides the search engine with a phrase which is intended to denote an object about which the user is trying to gather research information there is no particular document which the user knows about that s he is trying to get to rather the user is trying to locate a number of documents which together will give him her the information s he is trying to find semantic search lends itself well with this approach that is closely related with exploratory search rather than using ranking algorithms such as google s pagerank to predict relevancy semantic search uses semantics or the science of meaning in language to produce highly relevant search results in most cases the goal is to deliver the information queried by a user rather than have a user sort through a list of loosely related keyword results however google itself has subsequently also announced its own semantic search project 4 other authors primarily regard semantic search as a set of techniques for retrieving knowledge from richly structured data sources like ontologies as found on the semantic web such technologies enable the formal articulation of domain knowledge at a high level of expressiveness and could enable the user to specify his intent in more detail at query time 5 contents 1 disambiguation 2 commonly used searching

must occur when a term is ambiguous meaning it can have several meanings for example if one considers the lemma bark which can be understood as the sound of a dog the skin of a tree or a three masted sailing ship the disambiguation process is started thanks to which the most probable meaning is chosen from all those possible such processes make use of other information present in a semantic analysis system and takes into account the meanings of other words present in the sentence and in the rest of the text the determination of every meaning in substance influences the disambiguation of the others until a situation of maximum plausibility and coherence is reached for the sentence all the fundamental information for the disambiguation process that is all the knowledge used by the system is represented in the form of a semantic network organized on a conceptual basis in a structure of this type every lexical concept coincides therefore with a semantic network node and is linked to others by specific semantic relationships in a hierarchical and hereditary structure in this way each concept is enriched with the characteristics and meaning of the nearby nodes every node of the network called synset groups a set of synonyms which represent the same lexical concept called synsets and can contain single lemmata seat vacation work quick quickly more etc compounds non stop abat jour policeman collocations credit card university degree treasury stock go forward etc the semantic relationships links which identify the semantic relationships between the synsets are the order principals for the organization of the semantic network concepts edit commonly used searching methodologies m kel describes five mainly used methodologies 6 rdf path traversal traversing the net
