in mathematics logic and computer science type theory is any of several formal systems that can serve as alternatives to naive set theory or the study of such formalisms in general in programming language theory a branch of computer science type theory can refer to the design analysis and study of type systems although some computer scientists limit the term s meaning to the study of abstract formalisms such as typed calculi bertrand russell invented the first type theory in response to his discovery that gottlob frege s version of naive set theory was afflicted with russell s paradox this theory of types features prominently in whitehead and russell s principia mathematica it avoids russell s paradox by first creating a hierarchy of types then assigning each mathematical and possibly other entity to a type objects of a given type are built exclusively from objects of preceding types those lower in the hierarchy thus preventing loops alonzo church inventor of the lambda calculus developed a higher order logic commonly called church s theory of types 1 in order to avoid the kleene rosser paradox afflicting the original pure lambda calculus church s type theory is a variant of the lambda calculus in which expressions also called formulas or terms are classified into types and the types of expressions restrict the ways in which they can be combined in other words it is a typed lambda calculus the article church s type theory in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy is devoted to this subject today many other such calculi are in use including per martin l f s intuitionistic type theory jean yves girard s system f and the calculus of constructions in typed lambda calculi types play a role similar to that of sets in set theory contents 1 history 1 1 1900

section 9 external links edit history edit 1900 1927 edit origin of russell s theory of types in a letter to gottlob frege 1902 russell announced his discovery of the paradox in frege s begriffsschrift 2 frege promptly responded acknowledging the problem and proposing a solution in a technical discussion of levels to quote frege incidentally it seems to me that the expression a predicate is predicated of itself is not exact a predicate is as a rule a first level function and this function requires an object as argument and cannot have itself as argument subject therefore i would prefer to say a concept is predicated of its own extension 3 he goes about showing how this might work but seems to pull back from it as a consequence of what has become known as russell s paradox both frege and russell had to quickly amend works that they had at the printers in an appendix b that russell tacked on to his the principles of mathematics 1903 one finds his tentative theory of types the matter plagued russell for about five years 4 willard quine 5 presents a historical synopsis of the origin of the theory of types and the ramified theory of types after considering abandoning the theory of types 1905 russell proposed in turn three theories the zigzag theory theory of limitation of size the no class theory 1905 1906 and then readopting the theory of types 1908ff quine observes that russell s introduction of the notion of apparent variable had the following result the distinction between all and any all is expressed by the bound apparent variable of universal quantification which ranges over a type and any is expressed by the free real variable which refers schematically to any unspecified thing irrespective of type quine dismisses this notion of bound variable as pointless apart from a certain aspect of the theory of types 6 edit the 1908 ramified theory of types quine explains the ramified theory as follows it has been so called because the type of a function depends both on the types of its arguments and on the types of the apparent variables contained in it or in its expresion in case these exceed the types of the arguments 6 stephen kleene in his 1952 introduction to metamathematics describes the ramified theory of types this way the primary objects or individuals i e the given things not being subjected to logical analysis are assigned to one type say type 0 the properties of individuals to type 1 properties of properties of individuals to type 2 etc and no properties are admitted which do not fall into one of these logical types e g this puts the properties predicable and impredicable outside the pale of logic a more detailed account would describe the admitted types for other objects as relations and classes then to exclude impredicative definitions within a type the types above type 0 are further separated into orders thus for type 1 properties defined without mentioning any totality belong to order 0 and properties defined using the totality of properties of a given order belong to the next higher order but this separation into orders makes it impossible to construct the familiar analysis which we saw above contains impredicative definitions to escape this outcome russell postulated his axiom of reducibility which asserts that to any property belonging to an order above the lowest there is a coextensive property i e one possessed by exactly the same objects of order 0 if only definable properties are considered to exist then the axiom means that to every impredicative definition within a given type there is an equivalent predicative one kleene 1952 44 45 edit the axiom of reducibility and the notion of matrix but because the stipulations of the ramified theory would prove to quote quine onerous russell in his 1908 mathematical logic as based on the theory of types 7 also would propose his axiom of reducibility by 1910 whitehead and russell in their principia mathematica would further augment this axiom with the notion of a matrix a fully extensional specification of a function from its matrix a function could be derived by the process of generalization and vice versa i e the two processes are reversible i generalization from a matrix to a function by using apparent variables and ii the reverse process of reduction of type by courses of values substitution of arguments for the apparent variable by this method impredicativity could be avoided 8 edit truth tables eventually emil post 1921 would lay waste to russell s cumbersome 9 theory of types with his truth functions and their truth tables in his introduction to his 1921 post places the blame on russell s notion of apparent variable whereas the complete theory of whitehead and russell 1910 1912 1913 requires for the enunciation of its propositions real and apparent variables which represent both individuals and propositional functions of different kinds and as a result necessitates the cumbersome theory of types this subtheory uses only real variables and these real variables represent but one kind of entity which the authors have chosen to call elementary propositions at about the same time ludwig wittgenstein made short work of the theory of types in his 1922 work tractatus logico philosophicus in which he points out the following in parts 3 331 3 333 3 331 from this observation we get a further view into russell s theory of types russell s error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak of the meanings of his signs 3 332 no proposition can say anything about itself because the propositional sign cannot be contained in itself that is the whole theory of types 3 333 a function cannot be its own argument because the functional sign already contains the prototype of its own argument and it cannot contain itself wittgenstein proposed the truth table method as well in his 4 3 through 5 101 wittgenstein adopts an unbounded sheffer stroke as his fundamental logical entity and then lists all 16 functions of two variables 5 101 the notion of matrix as truth table appears as late as the 1940 1950 s in the work of tarski e g his 1946 indexes matrix see truth table 10 edit russell s doubts russell in his 1920 introduction to mathematical philosophy devotes an entire chapter to the axiom of infinity and logical types wherein he states his concerns now the theory of types emphatically does not belong to the finished and certain part of our subject much of this theory is still inchoate confused and obscure but the need of some doctrine of types is less doubtful than the precise form the doctrine should take and in connection with the axiom of infinity it is particularly easy to see the necessity of some such doctrine 11 russell abandons the axiom of reducibility in the second edition of principia mathematica 1927 he acknowledges wittgenstein s argument 12 at the outset of his introduction he declares there can be no doubt that there is no need of the distinction between real and apparent variables 13 now he fully embraces the matrix notion and declares a function can only appear in a matrix through its values but demurs in a footnote it takes the place not quite adequately of the axiom of reducibility 14 furthermore he introduces a new abbreviated generalized notion of matrix that of a logical matrix one that contains no constants thus p q is a logical matrix 15 thus russell has virtually abandoned the axiom of reducibility 16 but in his last paragraphs he states that from our present primitive propositions he cannot derive dedekindian relations and well ordered relations and observes that if there is a new axiom to replace the axiom of reducibility it remains to be discovered 17 edit theory of simple types in the 1920s leon chwistek 18 and frank p ramsey 19 noticed that if one is willing to give up the vicious circle principle the hierarchy of levels of types in the ramified theory of types see the history section for more on this can be collapsed the resulting restricted logic is called the theory of simple types 20 or perhaps more commonly simple type theory 21 detailed formulations of simple type theory were published in the late 1920s and early 1930s by r carnap f ramsey w v o quine and a tarski in 1940 alonzo church re formulated it as simply typed lambda calculus 22 and examined by g del in 1944 a survey of these developments is found in collins 2012 23 edit 1940s present this section requires expansion september 2009 edit g del 1944 kurt g del in his 1944 russell s mathematical logic gave the following definition of the theory of simple types in a footnote by the theory of simple types i mean the doctrine which says that the objects of thought or in another interpretation the symbolic expressions are divided into types namely individuals properties of individuals relations between individuals properties of such relations etc with a similar hierarchy for extensions and that sentences of the form a has the property b bears the relation r to c etc are meaningless if a b c r are not of types fitting together mixed types such as classes containing individuals and classes as elements and therefore also transfinite types such as the class of all classes of finite types are excluded that the theory of simple types suffices for avoiding also the epistemological paradoxes is shown by a closer analysis of these cf ramsey 1926 and tarski 1935 p 399 24 he concluded the 1 theory of simple types and 2 axiomatic set theory permit the derivation of modern mathematics and at the same time avoid all known paradoxes g del 1944 126 furthermore the theory of simple types is the system of the first principia principia mathematica in an appropriate interpretation m any symptoms show only too clearly however that the primitive concepts need further elucidation g del 1944 126 edit formulations of type theory edit mendelson s st the following system is mendelson s 1997 289 293 st st is equivalent with russell s ramified theory plus the axiom of reducibility the domain of quantification is partitioned into an ascending hierarchy of types with all individuals assigned a type quantified variables range over only one type hence the underlying logic is first order logic st is simple relative to the type theory of principia mathematica primarily because all members of the domain and codomain of any relation must be of the same type there is a lowest type whose individuals have no members and are members of the second lowest type individuals of the lowest type correspond to the urelements of certain set theories each type has a next higher type analogous to the notion of successor in peano arithmetic while st is silent as to whether there is a maximal type a transfinite number of types poses no difficulty these facts reminiscent of the peano axioms make it convenient and conventional to assign a natural number to each type starting with 0 for the lowest type but type theory does not require a prior definition of the naturals the symbols peculiar to st are primed variables and infix in any given formula unprimed variables all have the same type while primed variables range over the next higher type the atomic formulas of st are of two forms identity and the infix symbol suggests the intended interpretation set membership all variables appearing in the definition of identity and in the axioms extensionality and comprehension range over individuals of one of two consecutive types only unprimed variables ranging over the lower type can appear to the left of whereas to its right only primed variables ranging over the higher type can appear the first order formulation of st rules out quantifying over types hence each pair of consecutive types requires its own axiom of extensionality and of comprehension which is possible if extensionality and comprehension below are taken as axiom schemata ranging over types identity defined by extensionality an axiom schema let denote any first order formula containing the free variable comprehension an axiom schema remark any collection of elements of the same type may form an object of the next higher type comprehension is schematic with respect to as well as to types infinity there exists a nonempty binary relation over the individuals of the lowest type that is irreflexive transitive and strongly connected and with codomain contained in domain remark infinity is the only true axiom of st and is entirely mathematical in nature it asserts that is a strict total order with a codomain contained in its domain if 0 is assigned to the lowest type the type of is 3 infinity can be satisfied only if the co domain of is infinite thus forcing the existence of an infinite set if relations are defined in terms of ordered pairs this axiom requires a prior definition of ordered pair the kuratowski definition adapted to st will do the literature does not explain why the usual axiom of infinity there exists an inductive set of zfc of other set theories could not be married to st st reveals how type theory can be made very similar to axiomatic set theory moreover the more elaborate ontology of st grounded in what is now called the iterative conception of set makes for axiom schemata that are far simpler than those of conventional set theories such as zfc with simpler ontologies set theories whose point of departure is type theory but whose axioms ontology and terminology differ from the above include new foundations and scott potter set theory edit formulations based on equality this section requires expansion september 2009 church s type theory has been extensively studied by two of church s students leon henkin and peter b andrews since st is a higher order logic and in higher order logics one can define propositional connectives in terms of logical equivalence and quantifiers in 1963 henkin developed a formulation of st based on equality but in which he restricted attention to propositional types this was simplified later that year by andrews in his theory q 0 25 in this respect st can be seen as a particular kind of a higher order logic classified by p t johnstone in sketches of an elephant as having a lambda signature that is a higher order signature that contains no relations and uses only products and arrows function types as type constructors furthermore as johnstone put it st is logic free in the sense that it contains no logical connectives or quantifiers in its formulae 26 edit extensions edit type polymorphism main article type polymorphism polymorphism is a programming language feature that allows values of different data types to be handled using a uniform interface the concept of parametric polymorphism applies to both data types and functions a function that can evaluate to or be applied to values of different types is known as a polymorphic function a data type that can appear to be of a generalized type e g a list with elements of arbitrary type is designated polymorphic data type like the generalized type from which such specializations are made edit dependent types main article dependent types a dependent type is a type that depends on a value dependent types play a central role in intuitionistic type theory and in the design of functional programming languages like ats agda and epigram an example is the type of n tuples of real numbers this is a dependent type because the type depends on the value n edit practical impact edit computing main article type system the most obvious application of type theory is in constructing type checking algorithms in the semantic analysis phase of compilers for programming languages definitions of type system vary but the following one due to benjamin c pierce roughly corresponds to the current consensus in the programming language theory community a type system is a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute 27 in other words a type system divides program values into sets called types this is called a type assignment and makes certain program behaviors illegal on the basis of the types that are thus assigned for example a type system may classify the value hello as a string and the value 5 as a number and prohibit the programmer from adding hello to 5 based on that type assignment in this type system the program hello 5 would be illegal hence any program permitted by the type system would be provably free from the erroneous behavior of adding strings and numbers edit linguistics type theory is also widely in use in formal theories of semantics of natural languages especially montague grammar and its descendants the most common construction takes the basic types and for individuals and truth values respectively and defines the set of types recursively as follows if and are types then so is nothing except the basic types and what can be constructed from them by means of the previous clause are types a complex type is the type of functions from entities of type to entities of type thus one has types like which are interpreted as elements of the set of functions from entities to truth values i e indicator functions of sets of entities an expression of type is a function from sets of entities to truth values i e a indicator function of a set of sets this latter type is standardly taken to be the type of natural language quantifiers like everybody or nobody montague 1973 barwise and cooper 1981 edit social sciences gregory bateson introduced a theory of logical types into the social sciences his notions of double bind and logical levels are based on russell s theory of types this section requires expansion may 2008 edit connections to constructive logic main article curry howard correspondence this section requires expansion may 2008 edit relation to category theory although the initial motivation for category theory was far removed from foundationalism the two fields turned out to have deep connections as john lane bell writes in fact categories can themselves be viewed as type theories of a certain kind this fact alone indicates that type theory is much more closely related to category theory than it is to set theory in brief a category can be viewed as a type theory by regarding its objects as types or sorts i e roughly speaking a category may be thought of a type theory shorn of its syntax a number significant results follow in this way 28 cartesian closed categories correspond to the typed calculus lambek 1970 c monoids categories with products and exponentials and a single nonterminal object correspond to the untyped calculus observed independently by lambek and dana scott around 1980 locally cartesian closed categories correspond to martin l f type theories seely 1984 the interplay known as categorical logic has been a subject of active research since then see the monograph of jacobs 1999 for instance edit see also data type for concrete types of data in programming domain theory type
