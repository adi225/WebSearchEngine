directory or link directory is a directory on the world wide web it specializes in linking to other web sites and categorizing those links 1 a web directory is not a search engine and does not display lists of web pages based on keywords instead it lists web sites by category and subcategory most web directory entries are also not found by web crawlers but by humans 1 the categorization is usually based on the whole web site rather than one page or a set of keywords and sites are often limited to inclusion in only a few categories web directories often allow site owners to submit their site for inclusion and have editors review submissions for fitness rss directories are similar to web directories but contain collections of rss feeds instead of links to web sites contents 1 scope of listing 2 human edited directories 3 directories and search engine optimization 4 bid for position directories 5 see also 6 references edit scope of listing most of the directories are general in scope and list websites across a wide range of categories regions and languages but some niche directories focus on restricted regions single languages or specialist sectors one type of niche directory with a large number of sites in existence is the shopping directory shopping directories specialize in the listing of retail e commerce sites examples of well known general web directories are yahoo directory and the open directory project odp odp is significant due to its extensive categorization and large number of listings and its free availability for use by other directories and search engines 2 however a debate over the quality of directories and databases still continues as search engines use odp s content without real integration and some experiment using clustering there have been many attempts to make directory development easier such as using automated submission of related links by script or any number of available php portals and programs recently social software techniques have spawned new efforts of categorization with amazon com adding tagging to their product pages directories have various features in listing often depend upon the price paid for inclusion free submission 160 there is no charge for the review and listing of the site reciprocal link 160 a link back to the directory must be added somewhere on the submitted site in order to get listed in the directory no reciprocal link 160 a web directory where you will submit your links for free and no need to add link back to your website paid submission 160 a one time or recurring fee is charged for reviewing listing the submitted link no follow 160 there is a rel nofollow attribute associated with the link meaning search engines will give no weight to the link featured listing 160 the link is given a premium position in a category or multiple categories or other sections of the directory such as the homepage sometimes called sponsored listing bid for position 160 where sites are ordered based on bids affiliate links 160 where the directory earns commission for referred customers from the listed websites edit human edited directories a human edited directory is created and maintained by editors who add links based on the policies particular to that directory human edited directories are often targeted by seos on the basis that links from reputable sources will improve rankings in the major search engines some directories may prevent search engines from rating a displayed link by using redirects nofollow attributes or other techniques many human edited directories including the open directory project salehoo and world wide web virtual library are edited by volunteers who are often experts in particular categories these directories are sometimes criticized due to long delays in approving submissions or for rigid organizational structures and disputes among volunteer editors in response to these criticisms some volunteer edited directories have adopted wiki technology to allow broader community participation in editing the directory at the risk of introducing lower quality less objective entries another direction taken by some web directories is the paid for inclusion model this method enables the directory to offer timely inclusion for submissions and generally fewer listings as a result of the paid model they often offer additional listing options to further enhance listings including features listings and additional links to inner pages of the listed web site these options typically have an additional fee associated but offer significant help and visibility to sites and or their inside pages today submission of websites to web directories is considered a common seo search engine optimization technique to get back links for the submitted web site one distinctive feature of directory submission is that it cannot be fully automated like search engine submissions manual directory submission is a tedious and time consuming job and is often outsourced by the webmasters edit directories and search engine optimization there has been quite a bit of confusion as to whether links in directories can benefit a site in terms of search engine rankings one of the reasons is directories charge for the review of a submitted site and that has often been equated with buying links for seo purposes which people like matt cutts at google have said can be problematic directories can be helpful so long as there is a proper editorial policy where not all links are accepted and there is clear editing when it comes to anchor text and site descriptions paying for position in a directory can be more problematic bid for position directories or directories that sell site wide links can be more of an issue even featured links can be considered paid links by search engines like google getting listing in a directory that has a good editorial policy so that there are high quality links with good titles and descriptions is still thought to be a good way to get links to a website it is just important to be thoughtful of those directories or practices that have been reported to be harmful 3 edit bid for position directories bid for position directories or also known as bidding web directories are paid for inclusion web directories where the listings of websites in the directory are ordered according to their bid amount they are special in that the more a person pays the higher up the list of websites in the directory they go with the higher listing the website becomes more visible and increases the chances that visitors who browse the directory will click on the listing edit see also article directory list of web directories sobi2 webring directory scripts edit references a b wendy boswell what is a web directory
