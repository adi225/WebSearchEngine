used to refer to the laboratory which employs just under 2 400 full time employees 1 500 part time employees and hosts some 10 000 visiting scientists and engineers representing 608 universities and research facilities and 113 nationalities cern s main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high energy physics research as a result numerous experiments have been constructed at cern following international collaborations it is also the birthplace of the world wide web the main site at meyrin has a large computer centre containing powerful data processing facilities primarily for experimental data analysis because of the need to make these facilities available to researchers elsewhere it has historically been a major wide area networking hub

europe 1 the acronym cern originally stood in french for conseil europ en pour la recherche nucl aire european council for nuclear research which was a provisional council for setting up the laboratory established by 12 european governments in 1952 the acronym was retained for the new laboratory after the provisional council was dissolved even though the name changed to the current organisation europ enne pour la recherche nucl aire european organization for nuclear research in 1954 2 according to lew kowarski a former director of cern when the name was changed the acronym could have become the awkward oern and heisenberg said that the acronym could still be cern even if the name is not citation needed soon after the laboratory s establishment its work went beyond the study of the atomic nucleus into higher energy physics which is concerned mainly with the study of interactions between particles therefore the laboratory operated by cern is commonly referred to as the european laboratory for particle physics laboratoire europ en pour la physique des particules which better describes the research being performed at cern edit scientific achievements several important achievements in particle physics have been made during experiments at cern they include 1973 the discovery of neutral currents in the gargamelle bubble chamber 3 1983 the discovery of w and z bosons in the ua1 and ua2 experiments 4 1989 the determination of the number of light neutrino families at the large electron positron collider lep operating on the z boson peak 1995 the first creation of antihydrogen atoms in the ps210 experiment 5 1999 the discovery of direct cp violation in the na48 experiment 6 2010 the isolation of 38 atoms of antihydrogen 7 2011 maintaining antihydrogen for over 15 minutes 8 2012 a boson with mass around 125 gev c 2 consistent with long sought higgs boson 9 the 1984 nobel prize in physics was awarded to carlo rubbia and simon van der meer for the developments that led to the discoveries of the w and z bosons the 1992 nobel prize in physics was awarded to cern staff researcher georges charpak for his invention and development of particle detectors in particular the multiwire proportional chamber edit computer science see also history of the world wide web this next computer used by british scientist sir tim berners lee at cern became the first web server this cisco systems router at cern was probably one of the first ip routers deployed in europe citation needed the world wide web began as a cern project called enquire initiated by tim berners lee in 1989 and robert cailliau in 1990 10 berners lee and cailliau were jointly honoured by the association for computing machinery in 1995 for their contributions to the development of the world wide web based on the concept of hypertext the project was aimed at facilitating sharing information among researchers the first website went on line in 1991 on 30 160 april 1993 cern announced that the world wide web would be free to anyone a copy 11 of the original first webpage created by berners lee is still published on the world wide web consortium s website as a historical document prior to the web s development cern had been a pioneer in the introduction of internet technology beginning in the early 1980s a short history of this period can be found at cern ch 12 more recently cern has become a centre for the development of grid computing hosting projects including the enabling grids for e science egee and lhc computing grid it also hosts the cern internet exchange point cixp one of the two main internet exchange points in switzerland edit faster than light neutrino anomaly main article faster than light neutrino anomaly on 22 september 2011 the opera collaboration reported the detection of 17 gev and 28 gev muon neutrinos sent 730 kilometers 454 miles from cern near geneva switzerland to the gran sasso national laboratory in italy traveling apparently faster than light by a factor of 2 48 10 5 approximately 1 in 40 000 a statistic with 6 0 sigma significance 13 however in march 2012 it was reported by a new team of scientists for cern icarus that the previous experiment was most likely flawed and will be retested by scientists of both the opera and icarus teams 14 on 16 march cern came up with press release saying the results were flawed due to incorrectly connected gps synchronization cable 15 edit particle accelerators edit current complex map of the cern accelerator complex map of the large hadron collider together with the super proton synchrotron at cern cern operates a network of six accelerators and a decelerator each machine in the chain increases the energy of particle beams before delivering them to experiments or to the next more powerful accelerator currently active machines are two linear accelerators generate low energy particles linac2 accelerates protons to 50 160 mev for injection into the proton synchrotron booster psb and linac3 provides heavy ions at 4 2 160 mev u for injection into the low energy ion ring leir 16 the proton synchrotron booster increases the energy of particles generated by the proton linear accelerator before they are transferred to the other accelerators the low energy ion ring leir accelerates the ions from the ion linear accelerator before transferring them to the proton synchrotron ps this accelerator was commissioned in 2005 after having been reconfigured from the previous low energy antiproton ring lear the 28 gev proton synchrotron ps built in 1959 and still operating as a feeder to the more powerful sps the super proton synchrotron sps a circular accelerator with a diameter of 2 kilometres built in a tunnel which started operation in 1976 it was designed to deliver an energy of 300 160 gev and was gradually upgraded to 450 160 gev as well as having its own beamlines for fixed target experiments currently compass and na62 it has been operated as a proton antiproton collider the sp p s collider and for accelerating high energy electrons and positrons which were injected into the large electron positron collider lep since 2008 it has been used to inject protons and heavy ions into the large hadron collider lhc the on line isotope mass separator isolde which is used to study unstable nuclei the radioactive ions are produced by the impact of protons at an energy of 1 0 1 4 160 gev from the proton synchrotron booster it was first commissioned in 1967 and was rebuilt with major upgrades in 1974 and 1992 rex isolde increases the charge states of ions coming from the isolde targets and accelerates them to a maximum energy of 3 160 mev u the antiproton decelerator ad which reduces the velocity of antiprotons to about 10 of the speed of light for research into antimatter the compact linear collider test facility which studies feasibility issues for the future normal conducting linear collider project edit the large hadron collider main article large hadron collider most of the activities at cern are currently directed towards operating the new large hadron collider lhc and the experiments for it the lhc represents a large scale worldwide scientific cooperation project construction of the cms detector for lhc at cern the lhc tunnel is located 100 metres underground in the region between the geneva international airport and the nearby jura mountains it uses the 27 160 km circumference circular tunnel previously occupied by lep which was closed down in november 2000 cern s existing ps sps accelerator complexes will be used to pre accelerate protons which will then be injected into the lhc seven experiments cms atlas lhcb moedal 17 totem lhc forward and alice will run on the collider each of them will study particle collisions from a different point of view and with different technologies construction for these experiments required an extraordinary engineering effort just as an example a special crane had to be rented from belgium in order to lower pieces of the cms detector into its underground cavern since each piece weighed nearly 2 000 tons the first of the approximately 5 000 magnets necessary for construction was lowered down a special shaft at 13 00 160 gmt on 7 march 2005 this accelerator has begun to generate vast quantities of data which cern streams to laboratories around the world for distributed processing making use of a specialised grid infrastructure the lhc computing grid in april 2005 a trial successfully streamed 600 160 mb s to seven different sites across the world if all the data generated by the lhc is to be analysed then scientists must achieve 1 800 160 mb s before 2008 the initial particle beams were injected into the lhc august 2008 18 the first attempt to circulate a beam through the entire lhc was at 8 28 160 gmt on 10 september 2008 19 but the system failed because of a faulty magnet connection and it was stopped for repairs on 19 september 2008 the lhc resumed operation on friday 20 november 2009 by successfully circulating two beams each with an energy of 3 5 160 trillion electron volts the challenge that the engineers then faced was to try to line up the two beams so that they smashed into each other this is like firing two needles across the atlantic and getting them to hit each other according to the lhc s main engineer steve myers director for accelerators and technology at the swiss laboratory at 1200 bst on tuesday 30 march 2010 the lhc successfully smashed two proton particle beams travelling with 3 5 tev trillion electron volts of energy resulting in a 7 tev event however this is just the start of the road toward the expected discovery of the higgs boson this is mainly because the amount of data produced is so huge it could take up to 24 months to completely analyse it when the 7 tev experimental period ended the lhc revved up to 8 tev 4 tev acceleration in both directions in march 2012 and will begin particle collisions at that rate in early april 2012 at the end of 2012 the lhc will be shut down for maintenance for up to two years to strengthen the huge magnets inside the accelerator it will then attempt to create 14 tev events in july 2012 cern scientists claimed to have discovered a new sub atomic particle that could be the much sought after higgs boson believed to be essential for formation of the universe

of nine atoms of antihydrogen it was closed in 1996 and superseded by the antiproton decelerator edit sites cern s main site from switzerland looking towards france interior of office building 40 at the meyrin site building 40 hosts many offices for scientists working for cms and atlas the smaller accelerators are on the main meyrin site also known as the west area which was originally built in switzerland alongside the french border but has been extended to span the border since 1965 the french side is under swiss jurisdiction and there is no obvious border within the site apart from a line of marker stones there are six entrances to the meyrin site citation needed a in switzerland for all cern personnel at specific times b in switzerland for all cern personnel at all times often referred to as the main entrance c in switzerland for all cern personnel at specific times d in switzerland for goods reception at specific times e in france for french resident cern personnel at specific times controlled by customs personnel named porte charles de gaulle in recognition of his role in the creation of cern 21 tunnel entrance in france for equipment transfer to and from cern sites in france by personnel with a specific permit this is the only permitted route for such transfers under the cern treaty no taxes are payable when such transfers are made controlled by customs personnel the sps and lep lhc tunnels are almost entirely outside the main site and are mostly buried under french farmland and invisible from the surface however they have surface sites at various points around them either as the location of buildings associated with experiments or other facilities needed to operate the colliders such as cryogenic plants and access shafts the experiments are located at the same underground level as the tunnels at these sites three of these experimental sites are in france with atlas in switzerland although some of the ancillary cryogenic and access sites are in switzerland the largest of the experimental sites is the pr vessin site also known as the north area which is the target station for non collider experiments on the sps accelerator other sites are the ones which were used for the ua1 ua2 and the lep experiments the latter which will be used for lhc experiments outside of the lep and lhc experiments most are officially named and numbered after the site where they were located for example na32 was an experiment looking at the production of charmed particles and located at the pr vessin north area site while wa22 used the big european bubble chamber bebc at the meyrin west area site to examine neutrino interactions the ua1 and ua2 experiments were considered to be in the underground area i e situated underground at sites on the sps
