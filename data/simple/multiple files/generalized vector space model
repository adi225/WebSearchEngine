this article may be confusing or unclear to readers please help us clarify the article suggestions may be found on the talk page january 2010 the generalized vector space model is a generalization of the vector space model used in information retrieval wong et al 1 presented an analysis of the problems that the pairwise orthogonality assumption of the vector space model vsm creates from here they extended the vsm to the generalized vector space model gvsm edit definitions gvsm introduces term to term correlations which deprecate the pairwise orthogonality assumption more specifically they considered a new space where each term vector t i was expressed as a linear combination of 2 n vectors m r where r 1 2 n for a document d k and a query q the similarity function now becomes where t i and t j are now vectors of a 2 n dimensional space term correlation can be implemented in several ways as an example wong et al use as input to their algorithm the term occurrence frequency matrix obtained from automatic indexing and the output is term correlation between any pair of index terms edit semantic information on gvsm there are at least two basic directions for embedding term to term relatedness other than exact keyword matching into a retrieval model compute semantic correlations between terms compute frequency co occurrence statistics from large corpora recently tsatsaronis 2 focused on the first approach they measure semantic relatedness sr using a thesaurus o like wordnet it considers the path length captured by compactness scm and the path depth captured by semantic path elaboration spe they estimate the inner product by where s i and s j are senses of terms t i and t j respectively maximizing edit references wong s k m wojciech ziarko patrick c n wong 1985 generalized vector spaces model in information retrieval sigir acm http doi acm org 10 1145 253495 253506 tsatsaronis george vicky panagiotopoulou 2009 a generalized vector space model for text retrieval based on semantic relatedness http www aclweb org anthology e e09 e09 3009 pdf
