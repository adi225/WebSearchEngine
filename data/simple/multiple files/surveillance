the behavior activities or other changing information usually of people for the purpose of influencing managing directing or protecting 2 surveillance is therefore an ambiguous practice sometimes creating positive effects at other times negative it is sometimes done in a surreptitious manner it most usually involves observation of individuals or groups by government organizations though there are some exceptions such as disease surveillance which monitors the progress of a disease in a community without for that matter directly observing or monitoring individuals the word surveillance is the french word for watching over sur means from above and veiller means to watch the inverse reciprocal of surveillance is sousveillance to watch from below 3 the word surveillance may be applied to observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment such as cctv cameras or interception of electronically transmitted information such as internet traffic or phone calls it may also refer to simple relatively no or low technology methods such as human intelligence agents and postal interception surveillance is very useful to governments and law enforcement to maintain social control recognize and monitor threats and prevent investigate criminal activity with the advent of programs such as the total information awareness program and advise technologies such as high speed surveillance computers and biometrics software and laws such as the communications assistance for law enforcement act governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of their subjects 4 however many civil rights and privacy groups such as the electronic frontier foundation and american civil liberties union have expressed concern that by allowing continual increases in government surveillance of citizens we will end up in a mass surveillance society with extremely limited or non existent political and or personal freedoms fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as hepting v at amp t 4 5 contents 1 types of surveillance 1 1 computer surveillance 1 2 telephones 1 3 surveillance cameras 1 4 social network analysis 1 5 biometric surveillance 1 6

information awareness office a u s agency which developed technologies for mass surveillance the vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the internet 6 in the united states for example under the communications assistance for law enforcement act all phone calls and broadband internet traffic emails web traffic instant messaging etc are required to be available for unimpeded real time monitoring by federal law enforcement agencies 7 8 9 there is far too much data on the internet for human investigators to manually search through all of it so automated internet surveillance computers sift through the vast amount of intercepted internet traffic and identify and report to human investigators traffic considered interesting by using certain trigger words or phrases visiting certain types of web sites or communicating via email or chat with suspicious individuals or groups 10 billions of dollars per year are spent by agencies such as the information awareness office nsa and the fbi to develop purchase implement and operate systems such as carnivore narusinsight and echelon to intercept and analyze all of this data and extract only the information which is useful to law enforcement and intelligence agencies 11 computers can be a surveillance target because of the personal data stored on them if someone is able to install software such as the fbi s magic lantern and cipav on a computer system they can easily gain unauthorized access to this data such software could be installed physically or remotely 12 another form of computer surveillance known as tempest involves reading electromagnetic emanations from computing devices in order to extract data from them at distances of hundreds of meters 13 14 15 the nsa runs a database known as pinwale which stores and indexes large numbers of emails of both american citizens and foreigners 16 17 edit telephones main article lawful interception the official and unofficial tapping of telephone lines is widespread in the united states for instance the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea requires that all telephone and voip communications be available for real time wiretapping by federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies 7 8 9 two major telecommunications companies in the u s at amp t inc and verizon have contracts with the fbi requiring them to keep their phone call records easily searchable and accessible for federal agencies in return for 1 8 million dollars per year 18 between 2003 and 2005 the fbi sent out more than 140 000 national security letters ordering phone companies to hand over information about their customers calling and internet histories about half of these letters requested information on u s citizens 19 human agents are not required to monitor most calls speech to text software creates machine readable text from intercepted audio which is then processed by automated call analysis programs such as those developed by agencies such as the information awareness office or companies such as verint and narus which search for certain words or phrases to decide whether to dedicate a human agent to the call 20 law enforcement and intelligence services in the united kingdom and the united states possess technology to remotely activate the microphones in cell phones by accessing phones diagnostic or maintenance features in order to listen to conversations that take place near the person who holds the phone 21 22 23 24 25 26 mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data the geographical location of a mobile phone and thus the person carrying it can be determined easily even when the phone is not being used using a technique known multilateration to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several cell towers near the owner of the phone 27 28 the legality of such techniques has been questioned in the united states in particular whether a court warrant is required 29 records for one carrier alone sprint showed that in a given year federal law enforcement agencies requested customer location data 8 million times 30 edit surveillance cameras main article closed circuit television citizens under surveillance in cairns queensland surveillance cameras such as these are installed by the millions in many countries and are nowadays monitored by automated computer programs instead of humans surveillance cameras are video cameras used for the purpose of observing an area they are often connected to a recording device or ip network and may be watched by a security guard or law enforcement officer cameras and recording equipment used to be relatively expensive and required human personnel to monitor camera footage but analysis of footage has been made easier by automated software that organizes digital video footage into a searchable database and by video analysis software such as virat and humanid the amount of footage is also drastically reduced by motion sensors which only record when motion is detected with cheaper production techniques surveillance cameras are simple and inexpensive enough to be used in home security systems and for everyday surveillance in the united states the department of homeland security awards billions of dollars per year in homeland security grants for local state and federal agencies to install modern video surveillance equipment for example the city of chicago illinois recently used a 5 1 million homeland security grant to install an additional 250 surveillance cameras and connect them to a centralized monitoring center along with its preexisting network of over 2000 cameras in a program known as operation virtual shield speaking in 2009 chicago mayor richard daley announced that chicago would have a surveillance camera on every street corner by the year 2016 31 32 as part of china s golden shield project several u s corporations including ibm general electric and honeywell have been working closely with the chinese government to install millions of surveillance cameras throughout china along with advanced video analytics and facial recognition software which will identify and track individuals everywhere they go they will be connected to a centralized database and monitoring station which will upon completion of the project contain a picture of the face of every person in china over 1 3 billion people 33 lin jiang huai the head of china s information security technology office which is in charge of the project credits the surveillance systems in the united states and the u k as the inspiration for what he is doing with the golden shield project 33 a payload surveillance camera manufactured by controp and distributed to the u s government by adi technologies the defense advanced research projects agency darpa is funding a research project called combat zones that see that will link up cameras across a city to a centralized monitoring station identify and track individuals and vehicles as they move through the city and report suspicious activity such as waving arms looking side to side standing in a group etc 34 at super bowl xxxv in january 2001 police in tampa florida used identix s facial recognition software faceit to scan the crowd for potential criminals and terrorists in attendance at the event 35 it found 19 people with pending arrest warrants 36 governments often citation needed initially claim that cameras are meant to be used for traffic control but many of them end up using them for general surveillance for example washington d c had 5 000 traffic cameras installed under this premise and then after they were all in place networked them all together and then granted access to the metropolitan police department so they could perform day to day monitoring 37 the development of centralized networks of cctv cameras watching public areas linked to computer databases of people s pictures and identity biometric data able to track people s movements throughout the city and identify whom they have been with has been argued by some to present a risk to civil liberties 38 trapwire is an example of such a network edit social network analysis one common form of surveillance is to create maps of social networks based on data from social networking sites such as facebook myspace twitter as well as from traffic analysis information from phone call records such as those in the nsa call database 39 and others these social network maps are then data mined to extract useful information such as personal interests friendships amp affiliations wants beliefs thoughts and activities 40 41 42 43 many u s government agencies such as the defense advanced research projects agency darpa the national security agency nsa and the department of homeland security dhs are investing heavily in research involving social network analysis 44 45 the intelligence community believes that the biggest threat to u s power comes from decentralized leaderless geographically dispersed groups of terrorists subversives extremists and dissidents these types of threats are most easily countered by finding important nodes in the network and removing them to do this requires a detailed map of the network 42 43 46 47 jason ethier of northeastern university in his study of modern social network analysis said the following of the scalable social network analysis program developed by the information awareness office the purpose of the ssna algorithms program is to extend techniques of social network analysis to assist with distinguishing potential terrorist cells from legitimate groups of people in order to be successful ssna will require information on the social interactions of the majority of people around the globe since the defense department cannot easily distinguish between peaceful citizens and terrorists it will be necessary for them to gather data on innocent civilians as well as on potential terrorists jason ethier 42 at amp t developed a programming language called hancock which is able to sift through enormous databases of phone call and internet traffic records such as the nsa call database and extract communities of interest groups of people who call each other regularly or groups that regularly visit certain sites on the internet at amp t originally built the system to develop marketing leads 48 but the fbi has regularly requested such information from phone companies such as at amp t without a warrant 48 and after using the data stores all information received in its own databases regardless of whether or not the information was ever useful in an investigation 49 some people believe that the use of social networking sites is a form of participatory surveillance where users of these sites are essentially performing surveillance on themselves putting detailed personal information on public websites where it can be viewed by corporations and governments 40 about 20 of employers have reported using social networking sites to collect personal data on prospective or current employees 50 edit biometric surveillance fingerprints being scanned as part of the us visit program main article biometrics biometric surveillance is any technology that measures and analyze human physical and or behavioral characteristics for authentication identification or screening purposes 51 examples of physical characteristics include fingerprints dna and facial patterns examples of mostly behavioral characteristics include gait a person s manner of walking or voice facial recognition is the use of the unique configuration of a person s facial features to accurately identify them usually from surveillance video both the department of homeland security and darpa are heavily funding research into facial recognition systems 52 the information processing technology office ran a program known as human identification at a distance which developed technologies that are capable of identifying a person at up to 500 160 ft by their facial features another form of behavioral biometrics based on affective computing involves computers recognizing a person s emotional state based on an analysis of their facial expressions how fast they are talking the tone and pitch of their voice their posture and other behavioral traits this might be used for instance to see if a person is acting suspicious looking around furtively tense or angry facial expressions waving arms etc 53 a more recent development is dna fingerprinting which looks at some of the major markers in the body s dna to produce a match the fbi is spending 1 billion to build a new biometric database which will store dna facial recognition data iris retina eye data fingerprints palm prints and other biometric data of people living in the united states the computers running the database are contained in an underground facility about the size of two american football fields 54 55 56 the los angeles police department is installing automated facial recognition and license plate recognition devices in its squad cars and providing handheld face scanners which officers will use to identify people while on patrol 57 58 59 facial thermographs are in development which allow machines to identify certain emotions in people such as fear or stress by measuring the temperature generated by blood flow to different parts of their face 60 law enforcement officers believe that this has potential for them to identify when a suspect is nervous which might indicate that they are hiding something lying or worried about something 60 edit aerial surveillance micro air vehicle with attached surveillance camera aerial surveillance is the gathering of surveillance usually visual imagery or video from an airborne vehicle such as a unmanned aerial vehicle helicopter or spy plane military surveillance aircraft use a range of sensors e g radar to monitor the battlefield digital imaging technology miniaturized computers and numerous other technological advances over the past decade have contributed to rapid advances in aerial surveillance hardware such as micro aerial vehicles forward looking infrared and high resolution imagery capable of identifying objects at extremely long distances for instance the mq 9 reaper 61 a u s drone plane used for domestic operations by the department of homeland security carries cameras that are capable of identifying an object the size of a milk carton from altitudes of 60 000 feet and has forward looking infrared devices that can detect the heat from a human body at distances of up to 60 kilometers 62 in an earlier instance of commercial aerial surveillance the killington mountain ski resort hired eye in the sky aerial photography of its competitors parking lots to judge the success of its marketing initiatives as it developed starting in the 1950s 63 hart program concept drawing from official ipto darpa official website the united states department of homeland security is in the process of testing uavs to patrol the skies over the united states for the purposes of critical infrastructure protection border patrol transit monitoring and general surveillance of the u s population 64 miami dade police department ran tests with a vertical take off and landing uav from honeywell which is planned to be used in swat operations 65 houston s police department has been testing fixed wing uavs for use in traffic control 65 the united kingdom as well is working on plans to build up a fleet of surveillance uavs ranging from micro aerial vehicles to full size drones to be used by police forces throughout the u k 66 in addition to their surveillance capabilities mavs are capable of carrying tasers for crowd control or weapons for killing enemy combatants 67 programs such as the heterogenous aerial reconnaissance team program developed by darpa have automated much of the aerial surveillance process they have developed systems consisting of large teams drone planes that pilot themselves automatically decide who is suspicious and how to go about monitoring them coordinate their activities with other drones nearby and notify human operators if something suspicious is occurring this greatly increases the amount of area that can be continuously monitored while reducing the number of human operators required thus a swarm of automated self directing drones can automatically patrol a city and track suspicious individuals reporting their activities back to a centralized monitoring station 68 69 70 edit data mining and profiling data mining is the application of statistical techniques and programmatic algorithms to discover previously unnoticed relationships within the data data profiling in this context is the process of assembling information about a particular individual or group in order to generate a profile 160 that is a picture of their patterns and behavior data profiling can be an extremely powerful tool for psychological and social network analysis a skilled analyst can discover facts about a person that they might not even be consciously aware of themselves 71 economic such as credit card purchases and social such as telephone calls and emails transactions in modern society create large amounts of stored data and records in the past this data was documented in paper records leaving a paper trail or was simply not documented at all correlation of paper based records was a laborious process it required human intelligence operators to manually dig through documents which was time consuming and incomplete at best but today many of these records are electronic resulting in an electronic trail every use of a bank machine payment by credit card use of a phone card call from home checked out library book rented video or otherwise complete recorded transaction generates an electronic record public records such as birth court tax and other records are increasily being digitized and made available online in addition due to laws like calea web traffic and online purchases are also available for profiling electronic record keeping makes data easily collectable storable and accessible so that high volume efficient aggregation and analysis is possible at significantly lower costs information relating to many of these individual transactions is often easily available because it is generally not guarded in isolation since the information such as the title of a movie a person has rented might not seem sensitive however when many such transactions are aggregated they can be used to assemble a detailed profile revealing the actions habits beliefs locations frequented social connections and preferences of the individual this profile is then used by programs such as advise 72 and talon to determine whether the person is a military criminal or political threat in addition to its own aggregation and profiling tools the government is able to access information from third parties 160 for example banks credit companies or employers etc 160 by requesting access informally by compelling access through the use of subpoenas or other procedures 73 or by purchasing data from commercial data aggregators or data brokers the united states has spent 370 million on its 43 planned fusion centers which are national network of surveillance centers that are located in over 30 states the centers will collect and analyze vast amounts of data on u s citizens it will get this data by consolidating personal information from sources such as state driver s licensing agencies hospital records criminal records school records credit bureaus banks etc and placing this information in a centralized database that can be accessed from all of the centers as well as other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies 74 under united states v miller 1976 data held by third parties is generally not subject to fourth amendment warrant requirements edit corporate surveillance corporate surveillance is the monitoring of a person or group s behavior by a corporation the data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations but is also regularly shared with government agencies it can be used as a form of business intelligence which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and or services to be desirable by their customers or the data can be sold to other corporations so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose or it can be used for direct marketing purposes such as the targeted advertisements on google and yahoo where ads are targeted to the user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails 75 if they use free webmail services which is kept in a database 76 for instance google the world s most popular search engine stores identifying information for each web search an ip address and the search phrase used are stored in a database for up to 18 months 77 google also scans the content of emails of users of its gmail webmail service in order to create targeted advertising based on what people are talking about in their personal email correspondences 78 google is by far the largest internet advertising agency millions of sites place google s advertising banners and links on their websites in order to earn money from visitors who click on the ads each page containing google advertisements adds reads and modifies cookies on each visitor s computer 79 these cookies track the user across all of these sites and gather information about their web surfing habits keeping track of which sites they visit and what they do when they are on these sites this information along with the information from their email accounts and search engine histories is stored by google to use for building a profile of the user to deliver better targeted advertising 78 according to the american management association and the epolicy institute that undertake an annual quantitative survey about electronic monitoring and surveillance with approximately 300 u s companies more than one fourth of employers have fired workers for misusing e mail and nearly one third have fired employees for misusing the internet 80 more than 40 of the companies monitor e mail traffic of their workers and 66 of corporations monitor internet connections in addition most companies use software to block non work related websites such as sexual or pornographic sites game sites social networking sites entertainment sites shopping sites and sport sites the american management association and the epolicy institute also stress that companies tracking content keystrokes and time spent at the keyboard store and review computer files monitor the blogosphere to see what is being written about the company and monitor social networking sites 80 furthermore about 30 of the companies had also fired employees for non work related email and internet usage such as inappropriate or offensive language and viewing downloading or uploading inappropriate offensive content 80 81 the united states government often gains access to these databases either by producing a warrant for it or by simply asking the department of homeland security has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies such as google for augmenting the profiles of individuals whom it is monitoring 76 the fbi department of homeland security and other intelligence agencies have formed an information sharing partnership with over 34 000 corporations as part of their infragard program the u s federal government has gathered information from grocery store discount card programs which track customers shopping patterns and store them in databases in order to look for terrorists by analyzing shoppers buying patterns 82 edit human operatives organizations that have enemies who wish to gather information about the groups members or activities face the issue of infiltration 83 84 in addition to operatives infiltrating an organization the surveilling party may exert pressure on certain members of the target organization to act as informants i e to disclose the information they hold on the organization and its members 85 86 fielding operatives is very expensive and for governments with wide reaching electronic surveillance tools at their disposal the information recovered from operatives can often be obtained from less problematic forms of surveillance such as those mentioned above nevertheless human infiltrators are still common today for instance in 2007 documents surfaced showing that the fbi was planning to field a total of 15 000 undercover agents and informants in response to an anti terrorism directive sent out by george w bush in 2004 that ordered intelligence and law enforcement agencies to increase their humint capabilities 87 edit satellite imagery on may 25 2007 the u s director of national intelligence michael mcconnell authorized the national applications office nao of the department of homeland security to allow local state and domestic federal agencies to access imagery from military intelligence satellites and aircraft sensors which can now be used to observe the activities of u s citizens the satellites and aircraft sensors will be able to penetrate cloud cover detect chemical traces and identify objects in buildings and underground bunkers and will provide real time video at much higher resolutions than the still images produced by programs such as google earth 88 89 90 91 92 93 edit identification and credentials a card containing an identification number one of the simplest forms of identification is the carrying of credentials some nations have an identity card system to aid identification whilst many such as britain are considering it but face public opposition other documents such as passports driver s licenses library cards banking or credit cards are also used to verify identity if the form of the identity card is machine readable usually using an encoded magnetic stripe or identification number such as a social security number it corroborates the subject s identifying data in this case it may create an electronic trail when it is checked and scanned which can be used in profiling as mentioned above edit rfid and geolocation devices hand with planned insertion point for verichip device edit rfid tagging radio frequency identification rfid tagging is the use of very small electronic devices called rfid tags which are applied to or incorporated into a product animal or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves the tags can be read from several meters away they are extremely inexpensive costing a few cents per piece so they can be inserted into many types of everyday products without significantly increasing the price and can be used to track and identify these objects for a variety of purposes many companies are already tagging their workers who are monitored while on the job workers in u k went on general strike in protest of having themselves tagged they felt that it was dehumanizing to have all of their movements tracked with rfid chips 94 vague some critics have expressed fears that people will soon be tracked and scanned everywhere they go 95 rfid chip pulled from new credit card verichip is an rfid device produced by a company called applied digital solutions ads verichip is slightly larger than a grain of rice and is injected under the skin the injection reportedly feels similar to receiving a shot the chip is encased in glass and stores a verichip subscriber number which the scanner uses to access their personal information via the internet from verichip inc s database the global verichip subscriber registry thousands of people have already had them inserted 95 in mexico for example 160 workers at the attorney general s office were required to have the chip injected for identity verification and access control purposes 96 97 in a 2003 editorial cnet news com s chief political correspondent declan mccullagh speculated that soon every object that is purchased and perhaps id cards will have rfid devices in them which would respond with information about people as they walk past scanners what type of phone they have what type of shoes they have on which books they are carrying what credit cards or membership cards they have etc this information could be used for identification tracking or targeted marketing as of 2012 this has largely not come to pass 98 edit global positioning system diagram of gps satellites orbiting earth see also gps tracking in the u s police have planted hidden gps tracking devices in people s vehicles to monitor their movements without a warrant in early 2009 they were arguing in court that they have the right to do this 99 several cities are running pilot projects to require parolees to wear gps devices to track their movements when they get out of prison 100 edit mobile phones mobile phones are also commonly used to collect geolocation data the geographical location of a mobile phone and thus the person carrying it can be determined easily whether it is being used or not using a technique known multilateration to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several cell towers near the owner of the phone 27 28 edit surveillance devices see also united states v spy factory inc surveillance devices or bugs are hidden electronic devices which are used to capture record and or transmit data to a receiving party such as a law enforcement agency the u s has run numerous domestic intelligence such as cointelpro which have bugged the homes offices and vehicles of thousands of u s citizens usually political activists subversives and criminals 101 law enforcement and intelligence services in the u k and the united states possess technology to remotely activate the microphones in cell phones by accessing the phone s diagnostic maintenance features in order to listen to conversations that take place nearby the person who holds the phone 22 23 24 edit postal services as more people use faxes and e mail the significance of surveilling the postal system is decreasing in favor of internet and telephone surveillance but interception of post is still an available option for law enforcement and intelligence agencies in certain circumstances the u s central intelligence agency and federal bureau of investigation have performed twelve separate mail opening campaigns targeted towards u s citizens in one of these programs more than 215 000 communications were intercepted opened and photographed 102 103 edit controversy surrounding surveillance graffiti expressing concern about proliferation of video surveillance edit support some supporters of surveillance systems believe that these tools protect society from terrorists and criminals other supporters simply believe that there is nothing that can be done about it and that people must become accustomed to having no privacy as sun microsystems ceo scott mcnealy said you have zero privacy anyway get over it 104 105 another common argument is if you aren t doing something wrong then you don t have anything to fear which follows that if you are engaging in unlawful activities in which case you do not have a legitimate justification for your privacy however if you are following the law the surveillance would not affect you 106 edit opposition some critics state that the claim made by supporters should be modified to read as long as we do what we re told we have nothing to fear for instance a person who is part of a political group which opposes the policies of the national government might not want the government to know their names and what they have been reading so that the government cannot easily subvert their organization arrest or kill them other critics state that while a person might not have anything to hide right now the government might later implement policies that they do wish to oppose and that opposition might then be impossible due to mass surveillance enabling the government to identify and remove political threats further other critics point to the fact that most people do have things to hide for example if a person is looking for a new job they might not want their current employer to know this edit totalitarianism a traffic camera atop a high pole oversees a road in the canadian city of toronto programs such as the total information awareness program and laws such as the communications assistance for law enforcement act have led many groups to fear that society is moving towards a state of mass surveillance with severely limited personal social political freedoms where dissenting individuals or groups will be strategically removed in cointelpro like purges 4 5 107 kate martin of the center for national security studies said of the use of military spy satellites being used to monitor the activities of u s citizens they are laying the bricks one at a time for a police state 92 some point to the blurring of lines between public and private places and the privatization of places traditionally seen as public such as shopping malls and industrial parks as illustrating the increasing legality of collecting personal information 108 traveling through many public places such as government offices is hardly optional for most people yet consumers have little choice but to submit to companies surveillance practices 109 surveillance techniques are not created equal among the many biometric identification technologies for instance face recognition requires the least cooperation unlike automatic fingerprint reading which requires an individual to press a finger against a machine this technique is subtle and requires little to no consent 109 edit psychological social effects some critics such as michel foucault believe that in addition to its obvious function of identifying and capturing individuals who are committing undesirable acts surveillance also functions to create in everyone a feeling of always being watched so that they become self policing this allows the state to control the populace without having to resort to physical force which is expensive and otherwise problematic 110 edit privacy numerous civil rights groups and privacy groups oppose surveillance as a violation of people s right to privacy such groups include electronic privacy information center electronic frontier foundation american civil liberties union there have been several lawsuits such as hepting v at amp t and epic v department of justice by groups or individuals opposing certain surveillance activities legislative proceedings such as those that took place during the church committee which investigated domestic intelligence programs such as cointelpro have also weighed the pros and cons of surveillance edit counter surveillance inverse surveillance sousveillance countersurveillance is the practice of avoiding surveillance or making surveillance difficult developments in the late twentieth century have caused counter surveillance to dramatically grow in both scope and complexity such as the internet increasing prevalence of electronic security systems high altitude and possibly armed uavs and large corporate and government computer databases inverse surveillance is the practice of the reversal of surveillance on other individuals or groups e g citizens photographing police although this is more of a political reference as some groups specifically aim to harass police and retaliate for their own criminal pasts as well as ongoing criminal activity such as was the case with regard to rodney king s continual illegal activities this was confirmed upon his death when authorities recorded ongoing illegal drug and alcohol use well known examples are george holliday s recording of the rodney king beating and the organization copwatch which attempts to monitor police officers to prevent police brutality or for other nefarious uses as blackmailing it is well known that certain criminal rights groups seek to use counter methods in efforts to deter detection of criminal activities as was the case with rodney king s historical criminal record and the intentional set up to use counter surveillance as a form of entrapment to record police tactics to combat crimes counter surveillance can be also used in applications to prevent corporate spying or to track other criminals by certain criminal entities it can also be used to deter stalking methods used by various entities and organizations sousveillance is inverse surveillance involving the recording by private individuals rather than government or corporate entities 111 edit in popular culture edit in literature george orwell s novel 1984 portrays a
