sequence mining is a topic of data mining concerned with finding statistically relevant patterns between data examples where the values are delivered in a sequence 1 it is usually presumed that the values are discrete and thus time series mining is closely related but usually considered a different activity sequence mining is a special case of structured data mining there are several key traditional computational problems addressed within this field these include building efficient databases and indexes for sequence information extracting the frequently occurring patterns comparing sequences for similarity and recovering missing sequence members in general sequence mining problems can be classified as string mining which is typically based on string processing algorithms and itemset mining which is typically based on association rule learning contents 1 string mining 2 itemset mining 3 variants 4 application 5 see also 6 external links 6 1 implementations 7 references edit string mining string mining typically deals with a limited alphabet for items that appear in a sequence but the sequence itself may be typically very long examples of an alphabet can be those in the ascii character set used in natural language text nucleotide bases a g c and t in dna sequences or amino acids for protein sequences in biology applications analysis of the arrangement of the alphabet in strings can be used to examine gene and protein sequences to determine their properties knowing the sequence of letters of a dna a protein is not an ultimate goal in itself rather the major task is to understand the sequence in terms of its structure and biological function this is typically achieved first by identifying individual regions or structural units within each sequence and then assigning a function to each structural unit in many cases this requires comparing a given sequence with previously studied ones the comparison between the strings becomes complicated when insertions deletions and mutations occur in a string a survey and taxonomy of the key algorithms for sequence comparison for bioinformatics is presented in the paper string mining in bioinformatics 2 which include repeat related problems that deal with operations on single sequences and can be based on exact string matching or approximate string matching methods for finding dispersed fixed length and maximal length repeats finding tandem repeats and finding unique subsequences and missing un spelled subsequences alignment problems that deal with comparison between strings by first aligning one or more sequences examples of popular methods include blast for comparing a single sequence with multiple sequences in a database and clustalw for multiple alignments alignment algorithms can be based on either exact or approximate methods and can also be classified as global alignments semi global alignments and local alignment see sequence alignment edit itemset mining some problems in sequence mining lend themselves discovering frequent itemsets and the order they appear for example one is seeking rules of the form if a customer buys a car he or she is likely to buy insurance within 1 week or in the context of stock prices if nokia up and ericsson up it is likely that motorolla up and samsung up within 2 days traditionally itemset mining is used in marketing applications for discovering regularities between frequently co occurring items in large transactions for example by analysing transactions of customer shopping baskets in a supermarket one can produce a rule which reads if a customer buys onions and potatoes together he or she is likely to also buy hamburger meat in the same transaction a survey and taxonomy of the key algorithms for item set mining is presented in the paper frequent pattern mining current status and future directions 3 the two common techniques that are applied to sequence databases for frequent itemset mining are the influential apriori algorithm and the more recent fp growth technique edit variants the traditional sequential pattern mining is modified including some constraints and some behaviour aloysius george d binu 4 they have integrated three significant marketing scenarios for mining promotion oriented sequential patterns the promotion based market scenarios considered in their research are 1 product downturn 2 product revision and 3 product launch drl by considering these they developed a drl prefix span algorithm tailored from of the prefix span for mining all length drl patterns edit application with a great variation of products and user buying behaviors shelf on which products are being displayed is one of the most important resources in retail environment retailers can not only increase their profit but also decrease cost by proper management of shelf space allocation and products display to solve this problem aloysius george d binu 5 have proposed an approach to mine user buying patterns using prefixspan algorithm and place the products on shelves based on the order of mined purchasing patterns edit see also association rule learning data mining gsp algorithm process mining sequence analysis
