classic genres accepted in ancient greece poetry drama and prose poetry is further subdivided into epic lyric and drama the divisions are recognized as being set by aristotle and plato however they were not the only ones many genre theorists added to these accepted forms of poetry edit classical and romance genre theory the earliest recorded systems of genre in western history can be traced back to plato and aristotle g rard genette explains his interpretation of the history of genre in the architext he described plato as the creator of three imitational mimetic genres distinguished by mode of imitation rather than content these three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue the drama pure narrative the dithyramb and a mixture of the two the epic plato excluded lyric poetry as a non mimetic imitational mode genette further discussed how aristotle revised plato s system by first eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode he then uses two additional criteria to distinguish the system the first of the criteria is the object to be imitated whether superior or inferior the second criterion is the medium of presentation words gestures or verse essentially the three categories of mode object and medium can be visualized along an xyz axis excluding the criteria of medium aristotle s system distinguished four types of classical genres tragedy epic comedy and parody genette explained the integration of lyric poetry into the classical system by replacing the removed pure narrative mode lyric poetry once considered non mimetic was deemed to imitate feelings becoming the third architext a term coined by gennette of a new long enduring tripartite system lyrical epical the mixed narrative and dramatic the dialogue this new system that came to dominate all the literary theory of german romanticism genette 38 has seen numerous attempts at expansion and revision such attempts include friedrich schlegel s triad of subjective form the lyric objective form the dramatic and subjective objective form the epic however more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing complexity gennette reflected upon these various systems comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement its structure is somewhat superior to most of those that have come after fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse edit rhetorical situation j m barrie s works were notoriously hard to place in any single genre in 1968 lloyd bitzer claimed that discourse is determined by rhetorical situations in his article titled the rhetorical situation a rhetorical situation refers to the fact that every situation has the potential for a rhetorical response he looks to understand the nature behind the context that determines discourse bitzer states it is the situation which calls discourse into existence bitzer 2 thus the situation controls what type of rhetorical response takes place each situation has an appropriate response in which the rhetor can either act upon or not act upon bitzer he expresses the imperative nature of the situation in creating discourse because discourse only comes into being as a response to a particular situation discourse varies depending upon the meaning context that is created due to the situation and because of this it is embedded in the situation bitzer 4 according to bitzer rhetorical situations come into existence at which point they can either mature and go away or mature and continue to exist lolo describes rhetorical situations as containing three components exigence audience and constraints lolo highlights six characteristics needed from a rhetorical situation that are detrimental to creating discourse a situation calls a lolo to create discourse it invites a response to fit the situation the response meets the necessary requirements of the situation the exigence which creates the discourse is located in reality rhetorical situations exhibit simple or complex structures rhetorical situations after coming into creation either decline or persist lolo main argument is the concept that rhetoric is used to effect valuable changes in real lolo 14 in 1984 carolyn miller examined genre in terms of rhetorical situations she claimed that situations are social constructs that are the result not of perception but of definition miller 156 in other words we essentially define our situations miller seems to build from bitzer s argument regarding what makes something rhetorical which is the ability of change to occur opposite of bitzer s predestined and limited view of the creation of genres miller believes genres are created through social constructs she agreed with bitzer that past responses can indicate what is an appropriate response to the current situation but miller holds that rhetorically genre should be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish miller 151 since her view focuses on action it cannot ignore that humans depend on the context of the situation as well as motives that drive them to this action miller 152 essentially we create recurrence or similar responses through our construal of types miller 157 miller defines types as recognition of relevant similarities miller 156 7 types come about only after we have attempted to interpret the situation by way of social context which causes us to stick to tradition miller 152 miller does not want to deem recurrence as a constraint but rather she views it as insight into the human condition miller 156 the way to bring about a new type miller 157 is to allow for past routines to evolve into new routines thereby maintaining a cycle that is always open for change either way miller s view is in accordance with the fact that as humans we are creatures of habit that tightly hold on to a certain stock of knowledge miller 157 however change is considered innovation and by creating new types miller 157 we can still keep tradition miller 152 and innovation at the same time edit reciprocity of genre people often recognize genre based on the characteristics that the situation offers amy devitt states this when she says a genre is named because of its formal markers devitt 10 however she also says the formal markers can be defined because a genre has been named devitt 10 when we label something as a certain genre we also flag these same characteristics as contributing to what we already believe the genre to be these two quotes show how reciprocity functions within genre devitt displays the reciprocal nature of genre and situation according to the individual by using an example of a grocery store list a question posed by this example is is something a grocery list because it lists groceries or is it a grocery list because one person says it is a grocery list and we thus recognize all the items on the list as groceries though each possible answer to this raised question contradict one another they are both correct similarly individuals recognize the characteristics of the recurring rhetorical situations in the same way as they see them as affirmation of what they already know about the preexisting genre the rhetorical attributes of the genre act as both objects which define and are defined by genre in other words genre and rhetorical situations are reciprocals of one another devitt focused on activity system of genre and that the participants situation contexts and text are all mutually created no one aspect fully determines the other devitt edit antecedent genres written in 1975 kathleen hall jamieson s antecedent genre as rhetorical constraint declares that discourse is determined by the rhetorical situation as well as antecedent genres antecedent genres are genres of the past that are used as a basis to shape and form current rhetorical responses when placed in an unprecedented situation a rhetor can draw on antecedent genres of similar situations in order to guide their response however caution should be taken when drawing on antecedent genres because sometimes antecedent genres are capable of imposing powerful constraints jamieson 414 the intent of antecedent genres are to guide the rhetor toward a response consistent with situational demands and if the situational demands are not the same as when the antecedent genre was created the response to the situation might be inappropriate jamieson 414 through three examples of discourse the papal encyclical the early state of the union address and congressional replies she demonstrates how traces of antecedent genres can be found within each these examples clarify how a rhetor will tend to draw from past experiences that are similar to the present situation in order to guide them how to act or respond when they are placed in an unprecedented situation jamieson explains by use of these three examples that choices of antecedent genre may not always be appropriate to the present situation she discusses how antecedent genres place powerful constraints on the rhetor and may cause them to become bound by the manacles of the antecedent genre jamieson 414 these manacles she says may range in level of difficultly to escape jamieson urges one to be careful when drawing on the past to respond to the present because of the consequences that may follow ones choice of antecedent genre she reiterates the intended outcome through her statement of choice of an appropriate antecedent genre guides the rhetor toward a response consonant with situational demands jamieson 414 edit social construct bitzer s definition of exigence as an imperfection marked by urgency something waiting to be done bitzer 6 ties in with miller s idea of social action as the next step after an exigency is realized miller also points towards the theory that genres recur based on jamieson s observation that antecedent genres finding their way into new genres more importantly miller takes on the bigger picture of a rhetorical situation in which all of these steps happen situations are social constructs that are the result not of perception but of definition miller 156 from this it is understood that social constructs define situations and therefore exigence is also socially situated genre also understood in terms of social contexts provides greater meaning to each recurring situation it essentially allows for differentiation though past genres have a role in present and new genres through this differentiation genre is allowed to continue evolving just as social contexts continue to change with time bawarshi describes the way in which this happens as communicants and their social environments are constantly in the process of reproducing one another bawarshi 69 rhetoric essentially works the same way as seen in the example of writing bawarshi provides writing is not a social act simply because it takes place in some social context it is social because it is at work in shaping the very context within which it functions bawarshi 70 therefore through social constructs one can shape rhetorical works and in turn the works can shape the social context we create our contexts as we create our texts bawarshi 70 edit genre as social action the concept of genre is not limited to classifications and lists people interact within genres daily genre is determined based on the action it is used to accomplish by the individuals using that particular genre miller 152 the distance between the text or action of genre and its users does not have to be vast people respond to exigencies provided by genre every day exigence is a set of particular social patterns and expectations that provides a socially objectified motive for addressing the recurring situation of a particular genre miller 158 seeing genre as a social action provides the keys to understanding how to participate in the actions of a community miller 165 carolyn miller argues that a rhetorical sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish miller 151 the idea that rhetorical situations define genre means that participants in genre make decisions based on commonalities and repeat those instances genre is not only about the form of but also the mere repetitiveness of similarities the classroom setting exemplifies this when students wish to speak they raise their hands to signify that desire raising a hand is the correct response to speaking in turn in that particular social setting a person at lunch with a group of friends would not raise their hand to speak because the social situation is different miller concludes that social actions are the response to understanding how to participate in the actions of a community miller 156 carolyn miller builds on arguments made by other scholars while also contradicting bitzer s argument by giving her readers five features to understand genre miller 163 she believes that if something is rhetorical then there will be action not only will there be action but this action will also be repeated the repetition of action creates a regularized form of discourse miller would add that the result has more to do with the action accomplished by the situation miller recognizes that a person chooses to take a certain social action within a defined set of rules rules set in place by that user lastly a situation cannot dictate a response miller ends her article with the thought that genres are partly rhetorical education through her statement as a recurrent significant action a genre embodies an aspect of cultural rationality miller 165 here miller unknowingly encapsulates a future ideology about genre that genres are created by culture according to mnotho dlamini genre is basically a deep information in a particular context edit tyranny of genre the phrase tyranny of genre comes from genre theorist richard coe who wrote that the tyranny of genre is normally taken to signify how generic structures constrain individual creativity coe 188 if genre functions as a taxonomic classification system it could constrain individual creativity since the presence of many of the conventional features of a genre will allow a strong genre identification the presence of fewer features or the presence of features of other genres will result in a weak or ambiguous genre identification schauber 403 under the classification system concept of genre placing a text into a genre is vital since every text is read according to a genre which governs its interpretation schauber 401 the classification system concept results in a polarization of responses to texts that do not fit neatly into a genre or exhibit features of multiple genres the status of genres as discursive institutions does create constraints that may make a text that combines or mixes genres appear to be a cultural monstrosity such a text may be attacked or even made a scapegoat by some as well as be defended by others lacapra 220 under the more modern understanding of the concept of genre as social action la miller miller 152 a more situational approach to genre is enabled this situational approach frees genre from the classification system genre s tyranny of genre relying on the importance of the rhetorical situation in the concept of genre results in an exponential expansion of genre study which benefits literary analysis one literature professor writes the use of the contemporary revised genre idea as social action is a breath of fresh air and it has opened important doors in language and literature pedagogy bleich 130 instead of a codified classification as the pragmatic application of genre the new genre idea insists that human agents not only have the creative capacities to reproduce past action such as action embedded in genres but also can respond to changes in their environment and in turn change that environment to produce under determined and possibly unprecedented action such as by modifying genres killoran 72 edit stabilization homogenization and fixity never is there total stabilization in a recognized genre nor are there instances that indicate a complete lack of homogenization however because of the relative similarities between the terms stabilization and homogenization the amount of stabilization or homogenization a certain genre maintains is based on opinion necessary discourse is obviously always needed and is thus considered perfectly stabilized in rhetorical situation or antecedent genres that which is unprecedented mostly leads to stable and predictable responses outside the natural setting of a given form of discourse one may respond inappropriately due to an unrecognized alternate the unrecognized alternate is created by the lack of homogenization or differing expectations in the presented rhetorical situation jamieson fixity is uncontrolled by a given situation and is deliberately utilized by the affected before the rhetorical situation occurs fixity almost always directly effects stabilization and has little to no bearing on homogenization the choice of discourse will provide a certain value of fixity depending on the specific choice if a situation calls for more mediated responses the fixity of the situation is more prevalent and therefore is attributed with a stable demand of expectations stability nor fixity can be directly affected by the subject at hand the only option is affecting homogenization which in turn can positively or negatively affect stability directly choosing a fixed arena within genre inversely alters the homogenization of said chooser constituting as a new genre accompanied with modified genre subsets and a newly desired urgency the same ideological theory can be applied to how one serves different purposes creating either separate genres or modernized micro genres fairclough edit culture genre is embedded in culture but may clash with it at times there are occasions in which a cultural group may not be inclined to keep within the set structures of a genre anthony pare s studied inuit social workers in genre and identity individuals institutions and ideology in this study pare described the conflict between the genre of inuit social workers record keeping forms and the cultural values that prohibited them from fully being able to fulfill the expectations of this genre amy devitt further expands on the concept of culture in her 2004 essay a theory of genre by adding culture defines what situations and genres are likely or possible devitt 24 genre not only coexists with culture but also defines its very components genres abound in daily life and people often work within them unconsciously people often take for granted their prominence and ever present residence in society devitt touches on miller s idea of situation but expands on it and adds that the relationship with genre and situation is reciprocal an individual may find him or herself shaping the rhetorical situations which in turn affects the rhetorical responses that arise out of the situation because the social workers worked closely with different families they did not want to disclose many of the details that are standard in the genre of record keeping related to this field giving out such information would violate close cultural ties with the members of their community edit popular culture

the academic field genre regularly affects societal popular culture the mass media uses genre to classify forms of art such as music film television books etc favoritism plays an important part of distinguishing one genre from another fans of horror look differently upon comedy than fans of romance do genre has also been used to shape differences in cultural aspects of these popular subjects american films are distinctly different from french ones as country music is noticeably unlike irish folk music from walking in to the nearest movie rental store to searching for music via itunes genres are applicable in everyday life as organized classification systems even in places such as grocery stores or clothing stores genres are utilized to form an ordered flow to determine the differences between smaller classes within one particular subject pointing out the differences between fruit and dairy and punk to mod in modern culture sub genres often arise to prevent a feeling of homogenization and loss of identity as the rate of global communication continues to increase the creation of new pop culture sub genres per year does in near perfect tandem edit audiences although genres are not always precisely definable genre considerations are one of the most important factors in determining what a person will see or read the classification properties of genre can attract or repel potential users depending on the individual s understanding of a genre genre creates an expectation in that expectation is met or not many genres have built in audiences and corresponding publications that support them such as magazines and websites inversely audiences may call out for change in an antecedent genre and create an entirely new genre the term may be used in categorizing web pages like newspage and fanpage with both very different layout audience and intention rosso 2008 some search engines like viv simo try to group found web pages into automated categories in an attempt to show various genres the search hits might fit edit visual arts genre painting the term genre is much used in the history and criticism of visual art but in art history has meanings that overlap rather confusingly genre painting is a term for paintings where the main subject features human figures to whom no specific identity attaches in other words figures are not portraits characters from a story or allegorical personifications these are distinguished from staffage incidental figures in what is primarily a landscape or architectural painting genre painting may also be used as a wider term covering genre painting proper and other specialized types of paintings such as still life landscapes marine paintings and animal paintings the concept of the hierarchy of genres was a powerful one in artistic theory especially between the 17th and 19th centuries it was strongest in france where it was associated with the acad mie fran aise which held a central role in academic art the genres in hierarchical order are history painting including narrative religious mythological and allegorical subjects portrait painting genre painting or scenes of everyday life landscape landscapists were the common footmen in the army of art according to the dutch theorist samuel van hoogstraten and cityscape animal painting still life edit linguistics in philosophy of language figuring very prominently in the works of philosopher and literary scholar mikhail bakhtin bakhtin s basic observations were of speech genres the idea of heteroglossia modes of speaking or writing that people learn to mimic weave together and manipulate such as formal letter and grocery list or university lecture and personal anecdote in this sense genres are socially specified recognized and defined often informally by a particular culture or community the work of georg luk cs also touches on the nature of literary genres appearing separately but around the same time 1920s 1930s as bakhtin norman fairclough has a similar concept of genre that emphasizes the social context of the text genres are different ways of inter acting discoursally fairclough 2003 26 however this is just one way of conceiving genre charaudeau amp maingueneau determine four different analytic conceptualizations of genre a text s genre may be determined by its linguistic function formal traits textual organization relation of communicative situation to formal and organizational traits of the text charaudeau amp maingueneau 2002 278 280 edit literature main article literary genre in literature genre has been known as an intangible taxonomy this taxonomy implies a concept of containment or that an idea will be stable forever the earliest recorded systems of genre in western history can be traced back to plato and aristotle g rard genette a french literary theorist and author of the architext describes plato as creating three imitational genres dramatic dialogue pure narrative and epic a mixture of dialogue and narrative lyric poetry the fourth and final type of greek literature was excluded by plato as a non mimetic mode aristotle later revised plato s system by eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode and distinguishing by two additional criteria the object to be imitated as objects could be either superior or inferior and the medium of presentation such as words gestures or verse essentially the three categories of mode object and medium can be visualized along an xyz axis excluding the criteria of medium aristotle s system distinguished four types of classical genres tragedy superior dramatic dialogue epic superior mixed narrative comedy inferior dramatic dialogue and parody inferior mixed narrative genette continues by explaining the later integration of lyric poetry into the classical system during the romantic period replacing the now removed pure narrative mode lyric poetry once considered non mimetic was deemed to imitate feelings becoming the third leg of a new tripartite system lyrical epical and dramatic dialogue this system which came to dominate all the literary theory of german romanticism and therefore well beyond 38 has seen numerous attempts at expansion or revision however more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing scope and complexity
