implementation language c and c os cross platform multi platform license gnu general public license java community process usual filename extensions java class jar website for java developers java programming at wikibooks java is a general purpose concurrent class based object oriented computer programming language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible it is intended to let application developers write once run anywhere wora meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another java applications are typically compiled to bytecode class file that can run on any java virtual machine jvm regardless of computer architecture java is as of 2012 one of the most popular programming languages in use particularly for client server web applications with a reported 10 million users 10 11 java was originally developed by james gosling at sun microsystems which has since merged into oracle corporation and released in 1995 as a core component of sun microsystems java platform the language derives much of its syntax from c and c but it has fewer low level facilities than either of them the original and reference implementation java compilers virtual machines and class libraries were developed by sun from 1991 and first released in 1995 as of may 2007 in compliance with the specifications of the java community process sun relicensed most of its java technologies under the gnu general public license others have also developed alternative implementations of these sun technologies such as the

platform history duke the java mascot james gosling mike sheridan and patrick naughton initiated the java language project in june 1991 12 java was originally designed for interactive television but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time 13 the language was initially called oak after an oak tree that stood outside gosling s office it went by the name green later and was later renamed java from java coffee said to be consumed in large quantities by the language s creators 14 gosling aimed to implement a virtual machine and a language that had a familiar c c style of notation 15 sun microsystems released the first public implementation as java 1 0 in 1995 1 it promised write once run anywhere wora providing no cost run times on popular platforms fairly secure and featuring configurable security it allowed network and file access restrictions major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run java applets within web pages and java quickly became popular with the advent of java 2 released initially as j2se 1 2 in december 1998 1999 new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms for example j2ee targeted enterprise applications and the greatly stripped down version j2me for mobile applications mobile java j2se designated the standard edition in 2006 for marketing purposes sun renamed new j2 versions as java ee java me and java se respectively in 1997 sun microsystems approached the iso iec jtc1 standards body and later the ecma international to formalize java but it soon withdrew from the process 16 java remains a de facto standard controlled through the java community process 17 at one time sun made most of its java implementations available without charge despite their proprietary software status sun generated revenue from java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the java enterprise system sun distinguishes between its software development kit sdk and runtime environment jre a subset of the sdk the primary distinction involves the jre s lack of the compiler utility programs and header files on november 13 2006 sun released much of java as free and open source software foss under the terms of the gnu general public license gpl on may 8 2007 sun finished the process making all of java s core code available under free software open source distribution terms aside from a small portion of code to which sun did not hold the copyright 18 sun s vice president rich green said that sun s ideal role with regards to java was as an evangelist 19 following oracle corporation s acquisition of sun microsystems in 2009 2010 oracle has described itself as the steward of java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency 20 this did not hold oracle however from filing a lawsuit against google shortly after that for using java inside the android sdk see google section below java software runs on laptops to data centers game consoles to scientific supercomputers there are 930 million java runtime environment downloads each year and 3 billion mobile phones run java 21 on april 2 2010 james gosling resigned from oracle 22 principles james gosling the creator of java there were five primary goals in the creation of the java language 23 it should be simple object oriented and familiar it should be robust and secure it should be architecture neutral and portable it should execute with high performance it should be interpreted threaded and dynamic versions main article java

portability which means that computer programs written in the java language must run similarly on any hardware operating system platform this is achieved by compiling the java language code to an intermediate representation called java bytecode instead of directly to platform specific machine code java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code but they are intended to be interpreted by a virtual machine vm written specifically for the host hardware end users commonly use a java runtime environment jre installed on their own machine for standalone java applications or in a web browser for java applets standardized libraries provide a generic way to access host specific features such as graphics threading and networking a major benefit of using bytecode is porting however the overhead of interpretation means that interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than programs compiled to native executables would just in time jit compilers were introduced from an early stage that compile bytecodes to machine code during runtime implementations see also free java implementations oracle corporation is the current owner of the official implementation of the java se platform following their acquisition of sun microsystems on january 27 2010 this implementation is based on the original implementation of java by sun the oracle implementation is available for mac os x windows and solaris because java lacks any formal standardization recognized by ecma international iso iec ansi or other third party standards organization the oracle implementation is the de facto standard the oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions the java runtime environment jre which contains the parts of the java se platform required to run java programs and is intended for end users and the java development kit jdk which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the java compiler javadoc jar and a debugger openjdk is another notable java se implementation that is licensed under the gpl the implementation started when sun began releasing the java source code under the gpl as of java se 7 openjdk is the official java reference implementation the goal of java is to make all implementations of java compatible historically sun s trademark license for usage of the java brand insists that all implementations be compatible this resulted in a legal dispute with microsoft after sun claimed that the microsoft implementation did not support rmi or jni and had added platform specific features of their own sun sued in 1997 and in 2001 won a settlement of us 20 million as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from sun 24 as a result microsoft no longer ships windows with java platform independent java is essential to java ee and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation this environment enables portable server side applications wikiversity has learning materials about java platform enterprise edition java ee tutorial performance main article java performance programs written in java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in c 25 26 however java programs execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of just in time compilation in 1997 1998 for java 1 1 27 the addition of language features supporting better code analysis such as inner classes the stringbuffer class optional assertions etc and optimizations in the java virtual machine itself such as hotspot becoming the default for sun s jvm in 2000 as of december 2012 microbenchmarks show java 7 is approximately 44 slower than c 28 some platforms offer direct hardware support for java there are microcontrollers that can run java in hardware instead of a software java virtual machine and arm based processors can have hardware support for executing java bytecode through their jazelle option automatic memory management java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle the programmer determines when objects are created and the java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use once no references to an object remain the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer s code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use if methods for a nonexistent object are called a null pointer exception is thrown 29 30 one of the ideas behind java s automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management in some languages memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the stack or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the heap in the latter case the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer if the program does not deallocate an object a memory leak occurs if the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated the result is undefined and difficult to predict and the program is likely to become unstable and or crash this can be partially remedied by the use of smart pointers but these add overhead and complexity note that garbage collection does not prevent logical memory leaks i e those where the memory is still referenced but never used garbage collection may happen at any time ideally it will occur when a program is idle it is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object this can cause a program to stall momentarily explicit memory management is not possible in java java does not support c c style pointer arithmetic where object addresses and unsigned integers usually long integers can be used interchangeably this allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security as in c and some other object oriented languages variables of java s primitive data types are not objects values of primitive types are either stored directly in fields for objects or on the stack for methods rather than on the heap as commonly true for objects but see escape analysis this was a conscious decision by java s designers for performance reasons because of this java was not considered to be a pure object oriented programming language however as of java 5 0 autoboxing enables programmers to proceed as if primitive types were instances of their wrapper class java contains multiple types of garbage collectors by default hotspot uses the concurrent mark sweep collector also known as the cms garbage collector however there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap for 90 of applications in java the cms garbage collector is good enough 31 syntax main article java syntax the syntax of java is largely derived from c unlike c which combines the syntax for structured generic and object oriented programming java was built almost exclusively as an object oriented language all code is written inside a class and everything is an object with the exception of the primitive data types e g integers floating point numbers boolean values and characters which are not classes for performance reasons unlike c java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes this simplifies the language and aids in preventing potential errors and anti pattern design java uses similar commenting methods to c there are three different styles of comments a single line style marked with two slashes a multiple line style opened with and closed with and the javadoc commenting style opened with and closed with the javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the javadoc executable to compile documentation for the program example this is an example of a single line comment using two slashes this is an example of a multiple line comment using the slash and asterisk this type of comment can be used to hold a lot of information or deactivate code but it is very important to remember to close the comment this is an example of a javadoc comment javadoc can compile documentation from this

class helloworldapp public static void main string args system out println hello world display the string to compare this to other programming languages see the list of hello world program examples source files must be named after the public class they contain appending the suffix java for example helloworldapp java it must first be compiled into bytecode using a java compiler producing a file named helloworldapp class only then can it be executed or launched the java source file may only contain one public class but it can contain multiple classes with other than public access and any number of public inner classes a class that is not declared public may be stored in any java file the compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file the name of the class file is the name of the class with class appended for class file generation anonymous classes are treated as if their name were the concatenation of the name of their enclosing class a and an integer the keyword public denotes that a method can be called from code in other classes or that a class may be used by classes outside the class hierarchy the class hierarchy is related to the name of the directory in which the java file is located the keyword static in front of a method indicates a static method which is associated only with the class and not with any specific instance of that class only static methods can be invoked without a reference to an object static methods cannot access any class members that are not also static the keyword void indicates that the main method does not return any value to the caller if a java program is to exit with an error code it must call system exit explicitly the method name main is not a keyword in the java language it is simply the name of the method the java launcher calls to pass control to the program java classes that run in managed environments such as applets and enterprise javabean do not use or need a main method a java program may contain multiple classes that have main methods which means that the vm needs to be explicitly told which class to launch from the main method must accept an array of string objects by convention it is referenced as args although any other legal identifier name can be used since java 5 the main method can also use variable arguments in the form of public static void main string args allowing the main method to be invoked with an arbitrary number of string arguments the effect of this alternate declaration is semantically identical the args parameter is still an array of string objects but it allows an alternative syntax for creating and passing the array the java launcher launches java by loading a given class specified on the command line or as an attribute in a jar and starting its public static void main string method stand alone programs must declare this method explicitly the string args parameter is an array of string objects containing any arguments passed to the class the parameters to main are often passed by means of a command line printing is part of a java standard library the system class defines a public static field called out the out object is an instance of the printstream class and provides many methods for printing data to standard out including println string which also appends a new line to the passed string the string hello world is automatically converted to a string object by the compiler a more comprehensive example oddeven java import javax swing joptionpane public class oddeven input is the number that the user gives to the computer private int input a whole number int means integer this is the constructor method it gets called when an object of the oddeven type is being created public oddeven in most java programs constructors can initialize objects with default values or create other objects that this object might use to perform its functions in some java programs the constructor may simply be an empty function if nothing needs to be initialized prior to the functioning of the object in this program s case an empty constructor would suffice a constructor must exist however if the user doesn t put one in then the compiler will create an empty one this is the main method it gets called when this class is run through a java interpreter param args command line arguments unused public static void main final string args this line of code creates a new instance of this class called number also known as an object and initializes it by calling the constructor the next line of code calls the showdialog method which brings up a prompt to ask you for a number oddeven number new oddeven number showdialog public void showdialog try makes sure nothing goes wrong if something does the interpreter skips to catch to see what it should do try the code below brings up a joptionpane which is a dialog box the string returned by the showinputdialog method is converted into an integer making the program treat it as a number instead of a word after that this method calls a second method calculate that will display either even or odd this input integer parseint joptionpane showinputdialog please enter a number this calculate catch final numberformatexception e getting in the catch block means that there was a problem with the format of the number probably some letters were typed in instead of a number system err println error invalid input please type in a numerical value when this gets called it sends a message to the interpreter the interpreter usually shows it on the command prompt for windows users or the terminal for nix users assuming it s open private void calculate if this input 2 0 joptionpane showmessagedialog null even else joptionpane showmessagedialog null odd the import statement imports the joptionpane class from the javax swing package the oddeven class declares a single private field of type int named input every instance of the oddeven class has its own copy of the input field the private declaration means that no other class can access read or write the input field oddeven is a public constructor constructors have the same name as the enclosing class they are declared in and unlike a method have no return type a constructor is used to initialize an object that is a newly created instance of the class the calculate method is declared without the static keyword this means that the method is invoked using a specific instance of the oddeven class the reference used to invoke the method is passed as an undeclared parameter of type oddeven named this the method tests the expression input 160 2 0 using the if keyword to see if the remainder of dividing the input field belonging to the instance of the class by two is zero if this expression is true then it prints even if this expression is false it prints odd the input field can be equivalently accessed as this input which explicitly uses the undeclared this parameter oddeven number new oddeven declares a local object reference variable in the main method named number this variable can hold a reference to an object of type oddeven the declaration initializes number by first creating an instance of the oddeven class using the new keyword and the oddeven constructor and then assigning this instance to the variable the statement number showdialog calls the calculate method the instance of oddeven object referenced by the number local variable is used to invoke the method and passed as the undeclared this parameter to the calculate method input integer parseint joptionpane showinputdialog please enter a number is a statement that converts the type of string to the primitive data type int by using a utility function in the primitive wrapper

displayed in a web browser hello java import javax swing japplet import java awt graphics public class hello extends japplet public void paintcomponent final graphics g g drawstring hello world 65 95 the import statements direct the java compiler to include the javax swing japplet and java awt graphics classes in the compilation the import statement allows these classes to be referenced in the source code using the simple class name i e japplet instead of the fully qualified class name i e javax swing japplet the hello class extends subclasses the japplet java applet class the japplet class provides the framework for the host application to display and control the lifecycle of the applet the japplet class is a jcomponent java graphical component which provides the applet with the capability to display a graphical user interface gui and respond to user events the hello class overrides the paintcomponent graphics method additionally indicated with the annotation supported as of jdk 1 5 override inherited from the container superclass to provide the code to display the applet the paintcomponent method is passed a graphics object that contains the graphic context used to display the applet the paintcomponent method calls the graphic context drawstring string int int method to display the hello world string at a pixel offset of 65 95 from the upper left corner in the

element 33 although support for these elements by web browsers is inconsistent 34 however the applet tag is deprecated so the object tag is preferred where supported the host application typically a web browser instantiates the hello applet and creates an appletcontext for the applet once the applet has initialized itself it is added to the awt display hierarchy the paintcomponent method is called by the awt event dispatching thread whenever the display needs the applet to draw itself servlet main article java servlet java servlet technology provides web developers with a simple consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a web server and for accessing existing business systems servlets are server side java ee components that generate responses typically html pages to requests typically http requests from clients a servlet can almost be thought of as an applet that runs on the server side without a face hello java import java io import javax servlet public class hello extends genericservlet public void service final servletrequest request final servletresponse response throws servletexception ioexception response setcontenttype text html final printwriter pw response getwriter try pw println hello world finally pw close the import statements direct the java compiler to include all of the public classes and interfaces from the java io and javax servlet packages in the compilation the hello class extends the genericservlet class the genericservlet class provides the interface for the server to forward requests to the servlet and control the servlet s lifecycle the hello class overrides the service servletrequest servletresponse method defined by the servlet interface to provide the code for the service request handler the service method is passed a servletrequest object that contains the request from the client and a servletresponse object used to create the response returned to the client the service method declares that it throws the exceptions servletexception and ioexception if a problem prevents it from responding to the request the setcontenttype string method in the response object is called to set the mime content type of the returned data to text html the getwriter method in the response returns a printwriter object that is used to write the data that is sent to the client the println string method is called to write the hello world string to the response and then the close method is called to close the print writer which causes the data that has been written to the stream to be returned to the client javaserver pages main article javaserver pages javaserver pages jsp are server side java ee components that generate responses typically html pages to http requests from clients jsps embed java code in an html page by using the special delimiters lt and gt a jsp is compiled to a java servlet a java application in its own right the first time it is accessed after that the generated servlet creates the response swing application main article swing java swing is a graphical user interface library for the java se platform it is possible to specify a different look and feel through the pluggable look and feel system of swing clones of windows gtk and motif are supplied by sun apple also provides an aqua look and feel for mac os x where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking swing in java se 6 addresses this problem by using more native gui widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms this example swing application creates a single window with hello world inside hello java java se 5 import javax swing public class hello extends jframe public hello super hello super setdefaultcloseoperation windowconstants exit on close super add new jlabel hello world super pack super setvisible true public static void main final string args new hello the first import includes all of the public classes and interfaces from the javax swing package the hello class extends the jframe class the jframe class implements a window with a title bar and a close control the hello constructor initializes the frame by first calling the superclass constructor passing the parameter hello which is used as the window s title it then calls the setdefaultcloseoperation int method inherited from jframe to set the default operation when the close control on the title bar is selected to windowconstants exit on close this causes the jframe to be disposed of when the frame is closed as opposed to merely hidden which allows the java virtual machine to exit and the program to terminate next a jlabel is created for the string hello world and the add component method inherited from the container superclass is called to add the label to the frame the pack method inherited from the window superclass is called to size the window and lay out its contents the main method is called by the java virtual machine when the program starts it instantiates a new hello frame and causes it to be displayed by calling the setvisible boolean method inherited from the component superclass with the boolean parameter true once the frame is displayed exiting the main method does not cause the program to terminate because the awt event dispatching thread remains active until all of the swing top level windows have been disposed generics main article generics in java in 2004 generics were added to the java language as part of j2se 5 0 prior to the introduction of generics each variable declaration had to be of a specific type for container classes for example this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface usually object or a different container class has to be created for each contained class generics allow compile time type checking without having to create a large number of container classes each containing almost identical code in addition to enabling more efficient code certain runtime exceptions are converted to compile time exceptions a characteristic known as type safety criticism main article criticism of java criticisms directed at java include the implementation of generics 35 speed 36 37 the handling of unsigned numbers 38 the implementation of floating point arithmetic 39 and a history of security vulnerabilities in the primary java vm implementation hotspot 40 use by external companies android makes extensive use of java related technology google google

allows users to play high end pc and console games via the cloud and instantly demo games and applications from a webpage on any computer or internet connected device class libraries the java class library are the compiled bytecodes of source code developed by the jre implementor to support application development in java examples of these libraries are the core libraries which include collection libraries that implement data structures such as lists dictionaries trees sets queues and double ended queue or stacks xml processing parsing transforming validating libraries security internationalization and localization libraries the integration libraries which allow the application writer to communicate with external systems these libraries include the java database connectivity jdbc api for database access java naming and directory interface jndi for lookup and discovery rmi and corba for distributed application development jmx for managing and monitoring applications user interface libraries which include the heavyweight or native abstract window toolkit awt which provides gui components the means for laying out those components and the means for handling events from
