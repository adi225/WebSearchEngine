techcrunch characterized the service as a hybrid search engine 9 10 at the same time it produces its own content pages and thus is similar to mahalo kosmix and searchme 11 the name of the search engine has been called silly by frederic lardinois of read write web 12 weinberg said of the origin of the name really it just popped in my head one day and i just liked it it is certainly influenced derived from the game duck duck goose but other than that there is no relation e g 160 a metaphor 13 duckduckgo has been featured on techcrunch s elevator pitch friday 14 and it was a finalist in the boss mashable challenge 15 we didn t invest in it because we thought it would beat google we invested in it because there is a need for a private search engine we did it for the internet anarchists people that hang out on reddit and hacker news fred wilson 2012 techcrunch disrupt conference in new york 16 in july 2010 weinberg started a duckduckgo community website to allow the public to report problems discuss means of spreading the use of the search engine request features and discuss open sourcing the code 17 in september 2011 duckduckgo hired its first employee caine tighe 18 the next month union square ventures invested in ddg union square partner brad burnham stated we invested in duckduckgo because we became convinced that it was not only possible to change the basis of competition in search it was time to do it 19 linux mint signed an exclusive deal with duckduckgo in november and it is the default search engine for linux mint 12 20 in addition trisquel and the midori web browser use duckduckgo as their default search engine 21 by may 2012 the search engine was attracting 1 5 160 million searches a day weinberg reported that it had earned us 115 000 in

avaliable 25 in a lengthy profile in november 2012 the washington post indicated that searches on duckduckgo were up to 45 000 000 per month in october 2012 the article concluded weinberg s non ambitious goals make him a particularly odd and dangerous competitor online he can do almost everything that google or bing can t because it could damage their business models and if users figure out that they like the duckduckgo way better weinberg could damage the big boys without even really trying it s asymmetrical digital warfare and his backers at union square ventures say google is vulnerable 26 edit features duckduckgo s results are a compilation of many sources including yahoo search boss wikipedia wolfram alpha bing and its own web crawler the duckduckbot 2 27 28 it uses data from crowd sourced sites including wikipedia to populate zero click info boxes grey boxes above the results that display topic summaries and related topics 29 duckduckgo also offers the ability to show mostly shopping sites or mostly info non shopping websites via search buttons on its home page duckduckgo positions itself as a search engine that puts privacy first and as such it does not store ip addresses does not log user information and uses cookies only when needed weinberg states by default duckduckgo does not collect or share personal information that is our privacy policy in a nutshell 30 weinberg has refined the quality of his search engine results by deleting search results for companies he believes are content mills like demand media s ehow which publishes 4000 articles per day produced by paid freelance writers which weinberg says is low quality content designed specifically to rank highly in google s search index duckduckgo also filters pages with substantial advertising 31 in august 2010 duckduckgo introduced anonymous searching including an exit enclave for its search engine traffic using tor this allows anonymity by routing traffic through a series of encrypted relays weinberg stated i believe this fits right in line with our privacy policy using tor and ddg you can now be end to end anonymous with your searching and if you use our encrypted homepage you can be end to end encrypted as well 32 in 2011 duckduckgo introduced voice search for users of the google chrome voice search extension 33 duckduckgo also features what they call bang commands which give users the ability to redirect a search to specific websites 34 edit reception in a june 2011 article harry mccracken of time magazine commended duckduckgo comparing it to his favorite hamburger restaurant in n out burger it feels a lot like early google with a stripped down home page just as in n out doesn t have lattes or asian salads or sundaes or scrambled eggs ddg doesn t try to do news or blogs or books or images there s no auto completion or instant results it just offers core web search mostly the ten blue links approach that s still really useful no matter what its critics say as for the quality i m not saying that weinberg has figured out a way to return more relevant results than google s mighty search team but duck duck go is really good at bringing back useful sites it all feels meaty and straightforward and filler free 35 thom holwerda who reviewed the search engine for osnews praised its privacy features and shortcuts to site specific searches as well as criticizing google for track ing pretty much everything you do particularly because of the risk of such information being subject to a u s government subpoena 36 in 2012 in response to accusations that it was a monopoly google identified duckduckgo as a competitor weinberg was reportedly pleased and entertained by that acknowledgment 26 edit see also comparison of web search engines
