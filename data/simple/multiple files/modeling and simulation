this article provides insufficient context for those unfamiliar with the subject please help improve the article with a good introductory style october 2009 modeling and simulation m amp s is the use of models including emulators prototypes simulators and stimulators either statically or over time to develop data as a basis for making managerial or technical decisions the terms modeling and simulation are often used interchangeably 1 the use of modeling and simulation m amp s within engineering is well recognized simulation technology belongs to the tool set of engineers of all application domains and has been included in the body of knowledge of engineering management m amp s has already helped to reduce costs increase the quality of products and systems and document and archive lessons learned m amp s is a discipline on its own its many application domains often lead to the assumption that m amp s is pure application this is not the case and needs to be recognized by engineering management experts who want to use m amp s to ensure that the results of simulation are applicable to the real world the engineering manager must understand the assumptions conceptualizations and implementation constraints of this emerging field contents 1 interest in simulations 2 modeling and simulation as an emerging discipline 3 application domains 4 individual concepts 5 academic modeling and simulation programs 6 modeling and simulation body of knowledge 7 summary 8 see also 9 references 10 external links edit interest in simulations technically simulation is well accepted the 2006 national science foundation nsf report on simulation based engineering science 2 showed the potential of using simulation technology and methods to revolutionize the engineering science among the reasons for the steadily increasing interest in simulation applications are the following using simulations is generally cheaper and safer than conducting experiments with a prototype of the final product one of the biggest computers worldwide is currently designed in order to simulate the detonation of nuclear devices and their effects in order to support better preparedness in the event of a nuclear explosion similar efforts are conducted to simulate hurricanes and other natural catastrophes simulations can often be even more realistic than traditional experiments as they allow the free configuration of environment parameters found in the operational application field of the final product examples are supporting deep water operation of the us navy or the simulating the surface of neighbored planets in preparation of nasa missions simulations can often be conducted faster than real time this allows using them for efficient if then else analyses of different alternatives in particular when the necessary data to initialize the simulation can easily be obtained from operational data this use of simulation adds decision support simulation systems to the tool box of traditional decision support systems simulations allow setting up a coherent synthetic environment that allows for integration of simulated systems in the early analysis phase via mixed virtual systems with first prototypical components to a virtual test environment for the final system if managed correctly the environment can be migrated from the development and test domain to the training and education domain in follow on life cycle phases for the systems including the option to train and optimize a virtual twin of the real system under realistic constraints even before first components are being built edit modeling and simulation as an emerging discipline the emerging discipline of m amp s is based on developments in diverse computer science areas as well as influenced by developments in system theories systems engineering software engineering artificial intelligence and more this foundation is as diverse as that of engineering management and brings elements of art engineering and science together in a complex and unique way that requires domain experts to enable appropriate decisions when it comes application or development of m amp s technology in the context of this paper the diversity and application oriented nature of this new discipline some times results in the challenge that the supported application domains themselves already have vocabularies in place that are not necessarily aligned between disjunctive domains a comprehensive and concise representation of concepts terms and activities is needed that make up a professional body of knowledge for the m amp s discipline due to the broad variety of contributors this process is still ongoing 3 padilla et al recommend in do we need m amp s science to distinguish between m amp s science engineering and applications 4 m amp s science contributes to the theory of m amp s defining the academic foundations of the discipline m amp s engineering is rooted in theory but looks for applicable solution patterns the focus is general methods that can be applied in various problem domains m amp s applications solve real world problems by focusing on solutions using m amp s often the solution results from applying a method but many solutions are very problem domain specific and are derived from problem domain expertise and not from any general m amp s theory or method edit application domains there are many categorizations possible but the following taxonomy has been very successfully used in the defense domain and is currently applied to medical simulation and transportation simulation as well analyses support is conducted in support of planning and experimentation very often the search for an optimal solution that shall be implemented is driving these efforts what if analyses of alternatives fall into this category as well systems engineering support is applied for the procurement development and testing of systems this support can start in early phases and include topics like executable system architectures and it can support testing by providing a virtual environment in which tests are conducted training and education support provides simulators virtual training environments and serious games to train and educate people a special use of analyses support is applied to ongoing business operations traditionally decision support systems provide this functionality simulation systems improve their functionality by adding the dynamic element and allow to compute estimates and predictions including optimization and what if analyses edit individual concepts although the terms modeling and simulation are often used as synonyms within disciplines applying m amp s exclusively as a tool within the discipline of m amp s both are treated as individual and equally important concepts modeling is understood is the purposeful abstraction of reality resulting in the formal specification of a conceptualization and underlying assumptions and constraints m amp s is in particular interested in models that are used to support the implementation of an executable version on a computer the execution of a model over time is understood as the simulation while modeling targets the conceptualization simulation challenges mainly focus on implementation in other words modeling resides on the abstraction level whereas simulation resides on the implementation level conceptualization and implementation modeling and simulation are two activities that are mutually dependent but can nonetheless be conducted by separate individuals management and engineering knowledge and guidelines are needed to ensure that they are well connected like an engineering management professional in systems engineering needs to make sure that the systems design captured in a systems architecture is aligned with the systems development this task needs to be conducted with the same level of professionalism for the model that has to be implemented as well edit academic modeling and simulation programs modeling and simulation has only recently become an academic discipline of its own formerly those working in the field usually had a

information and capability competency that identifies the modeling and simulation m amp s community of practice and the m amp s profession industry and market 5 the m amp s bok index is a set of pointers providing handles so that subject information content can be denoted identified accessed and manipulated 6 the development of m amp s bok indices has been championed by simsummit edit summary in summary three activities have to be conducted and orchestrated to ensure success a model must be produced that captures formally the conceptualization a simulation must implement this model and management processes must ensure that model and simulation are interconnected and on the current state which means that normally the model needs to be updated in case the simulation is changed as well the military and defense domain in particular within the united states has been the main m amp s champion in form of funding as well as application of m amp s e g m amp s in modern military organizations is part of the acquisition procurement strategy specifically m amp s is used to conduct events and experiments that influence requirements and training for military systems as such m amp s is considered an integral part of systems engineering of military systems other application domains however are currently catching up m amp s in the fields of medicine transportation and other industries is poised to rapidly outstrip dod s use of m amp s in the years ahead if it hasn t already happened 7 edit see also computer simulation glossary of military modeling amp simulation i itsec
