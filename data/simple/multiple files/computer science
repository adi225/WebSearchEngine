computer science or computing science abbreviated cs or compsci is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications a computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems 1 its subfields can be divided into a variety of theoretical and practical disciplines some fields such as computational complexity theory which explores the fundamental properties of computational problems are highly abstract whilst fields such as computer graphics emphasize real world applications still other fields focus on the challenges in implementing computation for example programming language theory considers various approaches to the description of computation whilst the study of computer programming itself investigates various aspects of the use of programming language and complex systems human computer interaction considers the challenges in making computers and computations useful usable and universally accessible to humans computer science deals with the theoretical foundations of information and computation together with practical techniques for the implementation and application of these foundations contents 1

history main article history of computer science charles babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer ada lovelace is credited with writing the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer the earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity wilhelm schickard designed the first mechanical calculator in 1623 but did not complete its construction 2 blaise pascal designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator the pascaline in 1642 in 1694 gottfried wilhelm leibniz completed the step reckoner the first calculator that could perform all four arithmetic operations charles babbage designed a difference engine and then a general purpose analytical engine in victorian times 3 for which ada lovelace wrote a manual because of this work she is regarded today as the world s first programmer 4 around 1900 punched card machines were introduced during the 1940s as new and more powerful computing machines were developed the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors 5 as it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s 6 7 the world s first computer science degree program the cambridge diploma in computer science began at the university of cambridge computer laboratory in 1953 the first computer science degree program in the united states was formed at purdue university in 1962 8 since practical computers became available many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own right although many initially believed it was impossible that computers themselves could actually be a scientific field of study in the late fifties it gradually became accepted among the greater academic population 9 it is the now well known ibm brand that formed part of the computer science revolution during this time ibm short for international business machines released the ibm 704 and later the ibm 709 computers which were widely used during the exploration period of such devices still working with the ibm computer was frustrating if you had misplaced as much as one letter in one instruction the program would crash and you would have to start the whole process over again 9 during the late 1950s the computer science discipline was very much in its developmental stages and such issues were commonplace time has seen significant improvements in the usability and effectiveness of computing technology modern society has seen a significant shift in the users of computer technology from usage only by experts and professionals to a near ubiquitous user base initially computers were quite costly and some degree of human aid was needed for efficient use in part from professional computer operators as computer adoption became more widespread and affordable less human assistance was needed for common usage edit major achievements the german military used the enigma machine shown here during world war ii for communication they thought to be secret the large scale decryption of enigma traffic at bletchley park was an important factor that contributed to allied victory in wwii 10 despite its short history as a formal academic discipline computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society in fact along with electronics it is a founding science of the current epoch of human history called the information age and a driver of the information revolution seen as the third major leap in human technological progress after the industrial revolution 1750 1850 ce and the agricultural revolution 8000 5000 bce these contributions include the start of the digital revolution which includes the current information age and the internet 11 a formal definition of computation and computability and proof that there are computationally unsolvable and intractable problems 12 the concept of a programming language a tool for the precise expression of methodological information at various levels of abstraction 13 in cryptography breaking the enigma code was an important factor contributing to the allied victory in world war ii 10 scientific computing enabled practical evaluation of processes and situations of great complexity as well as experimentation entirely by software it also enabled advanced study of the mind and mapping of the human genome became possible with the human genome project 11 distributed computing projects such as folding home explore protein folding algorithmic trading has increased the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets by using artificial intelligence machine learning and other statistical and numerical techniques on a large scale 14 high frequency algorithmic trading can also exacerbate volatility 15 computer graphics and computer generated imagery have become almost ubiquitous in modern entertainment particularly in television cinema advertising animation and video games even films that feature no explicit cgi are usually filmed now on digital cameras or edited or postprocessed using a digital video editor citation needed simulation of various processes including computational fluid dynamics physical electrical and electronic systems and circuits as well as societies and social situations notably war games along with their habitats among many others modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are spice as well as software for physical realization of new or modified designs the latter includes essential design software for integrated circuits citation needed edit philosophy main article philosophy of computer science a number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science peter wegner argued that those paradigms are science technology and mathematics 16 peter denning s working group argued that they are theory abstraction modeling and design 17 amnon h eden described them as the rationalist paradigm which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics which is prevalent in theoretical computer science and mainly employs deductive reasoning the technocratic paradigm which might be found in engineering approaches most prominently in software engineering and the scientific paradigm which approaches computer related artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence 18 edit name of the field the term computer science appears in a 1959 article in communications of the acm 19 in which louis fein argues for the creation of a graduate school in computer sciences analogous to the creation of harvard business school in 1921 justifying the name by arguing that like management science it is applied and interdisciplinary in nature yet at the same time has all the characteristics of an academic discipline 20 his efforts and those of others such as numerical analyst george forsythe were rewarded universities went on to create such programs starting with purdue in 1962 21 despite its name a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves because of this several alternative names have been proposed 22 certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science to emphasize precisely that difference danish scientist peter naur suggested the term datalogy to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment while not necessarily involving computers the first scientific institution to use the term was the department of datalogy at the university of copenhagen founded in 1969 with peter naur being the first professor in datalogy the term is used mainly in the scandinavian countries also in the early days of computing a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the communications of the acm turingineer turologist flow charts man applied meta mathematician and applied epistemologist 23 three months later in the same journal comptologist was suggested followed next year by hypologist 24 the term computics has also been suggested 25 in europe terms derived from contracted translations of the expression automatic information e g informazione automatica in italian or information and mathematics are often used e g informatique french informatik german informatica italy inform tica spain portugal or informatika slavic languages are also used and have also been adopted in the uk as in the school of informatics of the university of edinburgh 26 a folkloric quotation often attributed to but almost certainly not first formulated by edsger dijkstra states that computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes note 1 the design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science for example the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems however there has been much cross fertilization of ideas between the various computer related disciplines computer science research also often intersects other disciplines such as philosophy cognitive science linguistics mathematics physics statistics and logic computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science 6 early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as kurt g del and alan turing and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic category theory domain theory and algebra the relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue which is further muddied by disputes over what the term software engineering means and how computer science is defined 27 david parnas taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals making the two separate but complementary disciplines 28 the academic political and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research edit areas of computer science as a discipline computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software 29 30 csab formerly called computing sciences accreditation board which is made up of representatives of the association for computing machinery acm and the ieee computer society ieee cs 31 identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science theory of computation algorithms and data structures programming methodology and languages and computer elements and architecture in addition to these four areas csab also identifies fields such as software engineering artificial intelligence computer networking and communication database systems parallel computation distributed computation computer human interaction computer graphics operating systems and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science 29 edit theoretical computer science main article theoretical computer science the broader field of theoretical computer science encompasses both the classical theory of computation and a wide range of other topics that focus on the more abstract logical and mathematical aspects of computing edit theory of computation main article theory of computation according to peter j denning the fundamental question underlying computer science is what can be efficiently automated 6 the study of the theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations in an effort to answer the first question computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation the second question is addressed by computational complexity theory which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems the famous p np problem one of the millennium prize problems 32 is an open problem in the theory of computation p np 160 gnitirw terces automata theory computability theory computational complexity theory cryptography quantum computing theory edit information and coding theory main articles information theory and coding theory information theory is related to the quantification of information this was developed by claude e shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data coding theory is the study of the properties of codes systems for converting information from one form to another and their fitness for a specific application codes are used for data compression cryptography error detection and correction and more recently also for network coding codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods edit algorithms and data structures analysis of algorithms algorithms data structures computational geometry edit programming language theory main article programming language theory programming language theory plt is a branch of computer science that deals with the design implementation analysis characterization and classification of programming languages and their individual features it falls within the discipline of computer science both depending on and affecting mathematics software engineering and linguistics it is an active research area with numerous dedicated academic journals type theory compiler design programming languages edit formal methods main article formal methods formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification development and verification of software and hardware systems the use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that as in other engineering disciplines performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design however the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high integrity and life critical systems where safety or security is of utmost importance formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals in particular logic calculi formal languages automata theory and program semantics but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification edit concurrent parallel and distributed systems main articles concurrency computer science and distributed computing concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously and potentially interacting with each other a number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including petri nets process calculi and the parallel random access machine model a distributed system extends the idea of concurrency onto multiple computers connected through a network computers within the same distributed system have their own private memory and information is often exchanged amongst themselves to achieve a common goal edit databases and information retrieval main articles database and database management systems a database is intended to organize store and retrieve large amounts of data easily digital databases are managed using database management systems to store create maintain and search data through database models and query languages edit applied computer science edit artificial intelligence main article artificial intelligence this branch of computer science aims to or is required to synthesise goal orientated processes such as problem solving decision making environmental adaptation learning and communication which are found in humans and animals from its origins in cybernetics and in the dartmouth conference 1956 artificial intelligence ai research has been necessarily cross disciplinary drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics symbolic logic semiotics electrical engineering philosophy of mind neurophysiology and social intelligence ai is associated in the popular mind with robotic development but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development which require computational understanding and modeling such as finance and economics data mining and the physical sciences the starting point in the late 1940s was alan turing s question can computers think and the question remains effectively unanswered although the turing test is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence but the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real world data machine learning computer vision image processing pattern recognition cognitive science data mining evolutionary computation information retrieval knowledge representation natural language processing robotics medical image computing edit computer architecture and engineering main articles computer architecture and computer engineering computer architecture or digital computer organization is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system it focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory the field often involves disciplines of computer engineering and electrical engineering selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional performance and cost goals digital logic microarchitecture multiprocessing operating systems computer networks databases computer security ubiquitous computing systems architecture compiler design programming languages edit computer graphics and visualization main article computer graphics computer science computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves syntheses and manipulations of image data the study is connected to many other fields in computer science including computer vision image processing and computational geometry and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and video games edit computer security and cryptography main articles computer security and cryptography computer security is a branch of computer technology whose objective includes protection of information from unauthorized access disruption or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users cryptography is the practice and study of hiding encryption and therefore deciphering decryption information modern cryptography is largely related to computer science for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity edit computational science computational science or scientific computing is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems in practical use it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation to problems in various scientific disciplines numerical analysis computational physics computational chemistry bioinformatics edit health informatics main article health informatics health informatics in computer science deals with computational techniques for solving problems in health care edit information science main article information science information retrieval knowledge representation natural language processing human computer interaction edit software engineering main article software engineering software engineering is the study of designing implementing and modifying software in order to ensure it is of high quality affordable maintainable and fast to build it is a systematic approach to software design involving the application of engineering practices to software software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software it doesn t just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software but its internal maintenance and arrangement both computer applications software engineers and computer systems software engineers are projected to be among the fastest growing occupations from 2008 and 2018 edit academia edit conferences conferences are strategic events of the academic research in computer science during those conferences researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet proceedings of these conferences are an important part of the computer

education some universities teach computer science as a theoretical study of computation and algorithmic reasoning these programs often feature the theory of computation analysis of algorithms formal methods concurrency theory databases computer graphics and systems analysis among others they typically also teach computer programming but treat it as a vessel for the support of other fields of computer science rather than a central focus of high level study the acm ieee cs joint curriculum task force computing curriculum 2005 and 2008 update 33 gives a guideline for university curriculum other colleges and universities as well as secondary schools and vocational programs that teach computer science emphasize the practice of advanced programming rather than the theory of algorithms and computation in their computer science curricula such curricula tend to focus on those skills that are important to workers entering the software industry the process aspects of computer programming are often referred to as software engineering while computer science professions increasingly drive the u s economy computer science education is absent in most american k 12 curricula a report entitled running on empty the failure to teach k 12 computer science in the digital age was released in october 2010 by association for computing machinery acm and computer science teachers association csta and revealed that only 14 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science the report also found that only nine states count high school computer science courses as a core academic subject in their graduation requirements in tandem with running on empty a new non partisan advocacy coalition computing in the core cinc was founded to influence federal and state policy such as the computer science education act which calls for grants to states to develop plans for improving computer science education and supporting computer science teachers within the united states a gender gap in computer science education has been observed as well research conducted by the wgbh educational foundation and the association for computing machinery acm revealed that more than twice as many high school boys considered computer science to be a very good or good college major than high school girls 34 in addition the high school advanced placement ap exam for computer science has displayed a disparity in gender compared to other ap subjects it has the lowest number of female participants with a composition of about 15 percent women 35 this gender gap in computer science is further witnessed at the college level where 31 percent of undergraduate computer science degrees are earned by women and only 8 percent of computer science faculty consists of women 36 according to an article published by the epistemic games group in august 2012 the number of women graduates in the computer science field has declined to 13 percent edit see also computer
