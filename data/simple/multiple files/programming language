programming language lists alphabetical categorical chronological generational v t e an example of a scripting language variant that has support for objects classes methods and inheritance scripting languages are particular kinds of programming languages usually dynamically typed and built to be easy to use a programming language is an artificial language designed to communicate instructions to a machine particularly a computer programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine and or to express algorithms precisely the earliest programming languages predate the invention of the computer and were used to direct the behavior of machines such as jacquard looms and player pianos citation needed thousands of different programming languages have been created mainly in the computer field with many being created every year most programming languages describe computation in an imperative style i e as a sequence of commands although some languages such as those that support functional programming or logic programming use alternative forms of description the description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax form and semantics meaning some languages are defined by a specification document for example the c programming language is specified by an iso standard while other languages such as perl 5 and

links edit definitions a programming language is a notation for writing programs which are specifications of a computation or algorithm 1 some but not all authors restrict the term programming language to those languages that can express all possible algorithms 1 2 traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include function and target a computer programming language is a language 3 used to write computer programs which involve a computer performing some kind of computation 4 or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers disk drives robots 5 and so on for example postscript programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display more generally a programming language may describe computation on some possibly abstract machine it is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a description possibly idealized of a machine or processor for that language 6 in most practical contexts a programming language involves a computer consequently programming languages are usually defined and studied this way 7 programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines abstractions programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution the practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the abstraction principle 8 this principle is sometimes formulated as recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions 9 expressive power the theory of computation classifies languages by the computations they are capable of expressing all turing complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms ansi iso sql and charity are examples of languages that are not turing complete yet often called programming languages 10 11 markup languages like xml html or troff which define structured data are not generally considered programming languages 12 13 14 programming languages may however share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined xslt for example is a turing complete xml dialect 15 16 17 moreover latex which is mostly used for structuring documents also contains a turing complete subset 18 19 the term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language 20 however the usage of both terms varies among authors including the exact scope of each one usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages 21 in this vein languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages for instance markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming 22 another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers which have finite hardware resources 23 john c reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution he also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages despite the fact they are commonly not turing complete and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats 24 edit elements all programming languages have some primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection these primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively edit syntax parse tree of python code with inset tokenization syntax highlighting is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code the language above is python main article syntax programming languages a programming language s surface form is known as its syntax most programming languages are purely textual they use sequences of text including words numbers and punctuation much like written natural languages on the other hand there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program the syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program the meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics either formal or hard coded in a reference implementation since most languages are textual this article discusses textual syntax programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions for lexical structure and backus naur form for grammatical structure below is a simple grammar based on lisp expression atom list atom number symbol number 0 9 symbol a z a z list expression this grammar specifies the following an expression is either an atom or a list an atom is either a number or a symbol a number is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign a symbol is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters excluding whitespace and a list is a matched pair of parentheses with zero or more expressions inside it the following are examples of well formed token sequences in this grammar 12345 a b c232 1 not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill formed per the language s rules and may depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation result in an error on translation or execution in some cases such programs may exhibit undefined behavior even when a program is well defined within a language it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it using natural language as an example it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false colorless green ideas sleep furiously is grammatically well formed but has no generally accepted meaning john is a married bachelor is grammatically well formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true the following c language fragment is syntactically correct but performs operations that are not semantically defined the operation p gt gt 4 has no meaning for a value having a complex type and p gt im is not defined because the value of p is the null pointer complex p null complex abs p sqrt p gt gt 4 p gt im if the type declaration on the first line were omitted the program would trigger an error on compilation as the variable p would not be defined but the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information the grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the chomsky hierarchy the syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a type 2 grammar i e they are context free grammars 25 some languages including perl and lisp contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution 26 in contrast to lisp s macro system and perl s begin blocks which may contain general computations c macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution 27 edit semantics the term semantics refers to the meaning of languages as opposed to their form syntax edit static semantics the static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms 1 for compiled languages static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time examples include checking that every identifier is declared before it is used in languages that require such declarations or that the labels on the arms of a case statement are distinct 28 many important restrictions of this type like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context e g not adding an integer to a function name or that subroutine calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments can be enforced by defining them as rules in a logic called a type system other forms of static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part of static semantics newer programming languages like java and c have definite assignment analysis a form of data flow analysis as part of their static semantics edit dynamic semantics main article semantics of programming languages once data has been specified the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data for example the semantics may define the strategy by which expressions are evaluated to values or the manner in which control structures conditionally execute statements the dynamic semantics also known as execution semantics of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior there are many ways of defining execution semantics natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice a significant amount of academic research went into formal semantics of programming languages which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia edit type system main articles data type type system and type safety a type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types how it can manipulate those types and how they interact the goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations any decidable type system involves a trade off while it rejects many incorrect programs it can also prohibit some correct albeit unusual programs in order to bypass this downside a number of languages have type loopholes usually unchecked casts that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types in most typed languages the type system is used only to type check programs but a number of languages usually functional ones infer types relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations the formal design and study of type systems is known as type theory edit typed versus untyped languages a language is typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable with the implication that it is not applicable to other types 29 for example the data represented by this text between the quotes is a string in most programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning most modern programming languages will therefore reject any program attempting to perform such an operation in some languages the meaningless operation will be detected when the program is compiled static type checking and rejected by the compiler while in others it will be detected when the program is run dynamic type checking resulting in a run time exception a special case of typed languages are the single type languages these are often scripting or markup languages such as rexx or sgml and have only one data type most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data in contrast an untyped language such as most assembly languages allows any operation to be performed on any data which are generally considered to be sequences of bits of various lengths 29 high level languages which are untyped include bcpl and some varieties of forth in practice while few languages are considered typed from the point of view of type theory verifying or rejecting all operations most modern languages offer a degree of typing 29 many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system see casting edit static versus dynamic typing in static typing all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed typically at compile time for example 1 and 2 2 are integer expressions they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates 29 statically typed languages can be either manifestly typed or type inferred in the first case the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions for example at variable declarations in the second case the compiler infers the types of expressions and declarations based on context most mainstream statically typed languages such as c c and java are manifestly typed complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages such as haskell and ml however many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference for example java and c both infer types in certain limited cases 30 dynamic typing also called latent typing determines the type safety of operations at run time in other words types are associated with run time values rather than textual expressions 29 as with type inferred languages dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions among other things this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution however type errors cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed potentially making debugging more difficult lisp perl python javascript and ruby are dynamically typed edit weak and strong typing weak typing allows a value of one type to be treated as another for example treating a string as a number 29 this can occasionally be useful but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at compile time and even at run time strong typing prevents the above an attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error 29 strongly typed languages are often termed type safe or safe an alternative definition for weakly typed refers to languages such as perl and javascript which permit a large number of implicit type conversions in javascript for example the expression 2 x implicitly converts x to a number and this conversion succeeds even if x is null undefined an array or a string of letters such implicit conversions are often useful but they can mask programming errors strong and static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts but usage in the literature differs some use the term strongly typed to mean strongly statically typed or even more confusingly to mean simply statically typed thus c has been called both strongly typed and weakly statically typed 31 32 it may seem odd to some professional programmers that c could be weakly statically typed however notice that the use of the generic pointer the void pointer does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast this is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in c without using an explicit cast such as int or char edit standard library and run time system main article standard library most programming languages have an associated core library sometimes known as the standard library especially if it is included as part of the published language standard which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms data structures and mechanisms for input and output a language s core library is often treated as part of the language by its users although the designers may have treated it as a separate entity many language specifications define a core that must be made available in all implementations and in the case of standardized languages this core library may be required the line between a language and its core library therefore differs from language to language indeed some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library for example in java a string literal is defined as an instance of the java lang string class similarly in smalltalk an anonymous function expression a block constructs an instance of the library s blockcontext class conversely scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs and which must be implemented as parts of a library edit design and implementation programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication having a syntactic form separate from its semantics and showing language families of related languages branching one from another 3 33 but as artificial constructs they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage a significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety since it has a precise and finite definition 34 by contrast natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities while constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has many programming languages have been designed from scratch altered to meet new needs and combined with other languages many have eventually fallen into disuse although there have been attempts to design one universal programming language that serves all purposes all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role 35 the need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of programmers programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity programs must balance speed size and simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers to supercomputers programs may be written once and not change for generations or they may undergo continual modification finally programmers may simply differ in their tastes they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language one common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of abstraction the earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer as new programming languages have developed features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer this lets them write more functionality per time unit 36 natural language processors have been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming however this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate edsger w dijkstra took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs and dismissed natural language programming as foolish 37 alan perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea 38 hybrid approaches have been taken in structured english and sql a language s designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming the most important of these artifacts are the language specification and implementation edit specification main article programming language specification the specification of a programming language is intended to provide a definition that the language users and the implementors can use to determine whether the behavior of a program is correct given its source code a programming language specification can take several forms including the following an explicit definition of the syntax static semantics and execution semantics of the language while syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar semantic definitions may be written in natural language e g as in the c language or a formal semantics e g as in standard ml 39 and scheme 40 specifications a description of the behavior of a translator for the language e g the c and fortran specifications the syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description which may be written in natural or a formal language a reference or model implementation sometimes written in the language being specified e g prolog or ansi rexx 41 the syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation edit implementation main article programming language implementation an implementation of a programming language provides a way to execute that program on one or more configurations of hardware and software there are broadly two approaches to programming language implementation compilation and interpretation it is generally possible to implement a language using either technique the output of a compiler may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter in some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting for instance some implementations of basic compile and then execute the source a line at a time programs that are executed directly on the hardware usually run several orders of magnitude faster than those that are interpreted in software citation needed one technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is just in time compilation here the virtual machine just before execution translates the blocks of bytecode which are going to be used to machine code for direct execution on the hardware edit usage thousands of different programming languages have been created mainly in the computing field 42 programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness when using a natural language to communicate with other people human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors and still expect their intent to be understood however figuratively speaking computers do exactly what they are told to do and cannot understand what code the programmer intended to write the combination of the language definition a program and the program s inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed within the domain of control of that program on the other hand ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using pseudocode which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language a programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data a programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation these concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available called primitives 43 programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment programs for a computer might be executed in a batch process without human interaction or a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter in this case the commands are simply programs whose execution is chained together when a language is used to give commands to a software application such as a shell it is called a scripting language citation needed edit measuring language usage main article measuring programming language popularity it is difficult to determine which programming languages are most widely used and what usage means varies by context one language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours a different one have more lines of code and a third utilize the most cpu time some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications for example cobol is still strong citation needed in the corporate data center often on large mainframes fortran in scientific and engineering applications and c in embedded applications and operating systems other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications various methods of measuring language popularity each subject to a different bias over what is measured have been proposed counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language 44 the number of books sold that teach or describe the language 45 estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches 46 counts of language references i e to the name of the language found using a web search engine combining and averaging information from various internet sites langpop com claims that 47 in 2008 the 10 most cited programming languages are in alphabetical order c c c java javascript perl php python ruby and sql edit taxonomies for more details on this topic see categorical list of programming languages there is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages a given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family the task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes for example java is both an object oriented language because it encourages object oriented organization and a concurrent language because it contains built in constructs for running multiple threads in parallel python is an object oriented scripting language in broad strokes programming languages divide into programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use traditionally programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences i e issuing commands these are generally called imperative programming languages a great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer which is the main feature of declarative programming 48 more refined paradigms include procedural programming object oriented programming functional programming and logic programming some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi paradigmatic an assembly language is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture by purpose programming languages might be considered general purpose system programming languages scripting languages domain specific languages or concurrent distributed languages or a combination of these 49 some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals 50 a programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm for instance most programming languages use english language keywords while a minority do not other languages may be classified as being deliberately esoteric or not edit history a selection of textbooks that teach programming in languages both popular and obscure these are only a few of the thousands of programming languages and dialects that have been designed in history main articles history of programming languages and programming language generations edit early developments the first programming languages predate the modern computer the 19th century saw the invention of programmable looms and player piano scrolls both of which implemented examples of domain specific languages by the beginning of the twentieth century punch cards encoded data and directed mechanical processing in the 1930s and 1940s the formalisms of alonzo church s lambda calculus and alan turing s turing machines provided mathematical abstractions for expressing algorithms the lambda calculus remains influential in language design 51 in the 1940s the first electrically powered digital computers were created grace hopper was one of the first programmers of the harvard mark i computer a pioneer in the field developed the first compiler around 1952 for a computer programming language notwithstanding the idea of programming language existed earlier the first high level programming language to be designed for a computer was plankalk l developed for the german z3 by konrad zuse between 1943 and 1945 however it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000 52 programmers of early 1950s computers notably univac i and ibm 701 used machine language programs that is the first generation language 1gl 1gl programming was quickly superseded by similarly machine specific but mnemonic second generation languages 2gl known as assembly languages or assembler later in the 1950s assembly language programming which had evolved to include the use of macro instructions was followed by the development of third generation programming languages 3gl such as fortran lisp and cobol 53 3gls are more abstract and are portable or at least implemented similarly on computers that do not support the same native machine code updated versions of all of these 3gls are still in general use and each has strongly influenced the development of later languages 54 at the end of the 1950s the language formalized as algol 60 was introduced and most later programming languages are in many respects descendants of algol 54 the format and use of the early programming languages was heavily influenced by the constraints of the interface 55 edit refinement the period from the 1960s to the late 1970s brought the development of the major language paradigms now in use though many aspects were refinements of ideas in the very first third generation programming languages apl introduced array programming and influenced functional programming 56 pl i npl was designed in the early 1960s to incorporate the best ideas from fortran and cobol in the 1960s simula was the first language designed to support object oriented programming in the mid 1970s smalltalk followed with the first purely object oriented language c was developed between 1969 and 1973 as a system programming language and remains popular 57 prolog designed in 1972 was the first logic programming language in 1978 ml built a polymorphic type system on top of lisp pioneering statically typed functional programming languages each of these languages spawned an entire family of descendants and most modern languages count at least one of them in their ancestry the 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of structured programming and whether programming languages should be designed to support it 58 edsger dijkstra in a famous 1968 letter published in the communications of the acm argued that goto statements should be eliminated from all higher level programming languages 59 the 1960s and 1970s also saw expansion of techniques that reduced the footprint of a program as well as improved productivity of the programmer and user the card deck for an early 4gl was a lot smaller for the same functionality expressed in a 3gl deck edit consolidation and growth the 1980s were years of relative consolidation c combined object oriented and systems programming the united states government standardized ada a systems programming language derived from pascal and intended for use by defense contractors in japan and elsewhere vast sums were spent investigating so called fifth generation languages that incorporated logic programming constructs 60 the functional languages community moved to standardize ml and lisp rather than inventing new paradigms all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decade one important trend in language design for programming large scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of modules or large scale organizational units of code modula 2 ada and ml all developed notable module systems in the 1980s although other languages such as pl i already had extensive support for modular programming module systems were often wedded to generic programming constructs 61 the rapid growth of the internet in the mid 1990s created opportunities for new languages perl originally a unix scripting tool first released in 1987 became common in dynamic websites java came to be used for server side programming and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of write once run anywhere ucsd pascal had been popular for a time in the early 1980s these developments were not fundamentally novel rather they were refinements to existing languages and paradigms and largely based on the c family of programming languages programming language evolution continues in both industry and research current directions include security and reliability verification new kinds of modularity mixins delegates aspects and database integration such as microsoft s linq the 4gls are examples of languages which are domain specific such as sql which manipulates and returns sets of data rather than the scalar values which are canonical to most programming languages perl for example with its here document can hold multiple 4gl programs as well as multiple javascript programs in part of its own perl code and use variable interpolation in the here document to support multi language programming 62 edit
