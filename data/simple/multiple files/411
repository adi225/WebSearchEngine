olap cube an olap cube is an array of data understood in terms of its 0 or more dimensions olap is an acronym for online analytical processing 1 olap is a computer based technique for analyzing business data in the search for business intelligence 2 contents 1 terminology 2 hierarchy 3 operations 4 mathematical definition 5 see also 6 references 7 external links edit terminology a cube can be considered a generalization of a two dimensional spreadsheet for example a company might wish to summarize financial data by product by time period by city to compare actual and budget expenses product time city and scenario actual and budget are the data s dimensions 3 cube is a shortcut for multidimensional dataset given that data can have an arbitrary number of dimensions the term hypercube is sometimes used especially for data with more than three dimensions each cell of the cube holds a number that represents some measure of the business such as sales profits expenses budget and forecast olap data is typically stored in a star schema or snowflake schema in a relational data warehouse or in a special purpose data management system measures are derived from the records in the fact table and dimensions are derived from the dimension tables edit hierarchy the elements of a dimension can be organized as a hierarchy 4 a set of parent child relationships typically where a parent member summarizes its children parent elements can further be aggregated as the children of another parent 5 for example may 2005 s parent is second quarter 2005 which is in turn the child of year 2005 similarly cities are the children of regions products roll into product groups and individual expense items into types of expenditure edit operations conceiving data as a cube with hierarchical dimensions leads to conceptually straightforward operations to facilitate analysis aligning the data content with a familiar visualization enhances analyst learning and productivity 5 the user initiated process of navigating by calling for page displays interactively through the specification of slices via rotations and drill down up is sometimes called slice and dice common operations include slice and dice drill down roll up and pivot olap slicing slice is the act of picking a rectangular subset of a cube by choosing a single value for one of its dimensions creating a new cube with one fewer dimension 5 the picture shows a slicing operation the sales figures of all sales regions and all product categories of the company in the year 2004 are sliced out of the data cube olap dicing dice the dice operation produces a subcube by allowing the analyst to pick specific values of multiple dimensions 6 the picture shows a dicing operation the new cube shows the sales figures of a limited number of product categories the time and region dimensions cover the same range as before olap drill up and drill down drill down up allows the user to navigate among levels of data ranging from the most summarized up to the most detailed down 5 the picture shows a drill down operation the analyst moves from the summary category outdoor schutzausr stung to see the sales figures for the individual products roll up a roll up involves summarizing the data along a dimension the summarization rule might be computing totals along a hierarchy or applying a set of formulas such as profit sales expenses 5 olap pivoting pivot allows an analyst to rotate the cube in space to see its various faces for example cities could be arranged vertically and products horizontally while viewing data for a particular quarter pivoting could replace products with time periods to see data across time for a single product 5 7 the picture shows a pivoting operation the whole cube is rotated giving another perspective on the data edit mathematical definition this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed july 2012 in database theory an olap cube is 8 an abstract representation of a projection of an rdbms relation given a relation of order n consider a projection that subtends x y and z as the key and w as the residual attribute characterizing this as a function f 160 x y z w the attributes x y and z correspond to the axes of the cube while the w value into which each x y z triple maps corresponds to the data element that populates each cell of the cube insofar as two dimensional output devices cannot readily characterize four dimensions it is more practical to project slices of the data cube we say project in the classic vector analytic sense of dimensional reduction not in the sql sense although the two are conceptually similar g 160 x y w which may suppress a primary key but still have some semantic significance perhaps a slice of the triadic functional representation for a given z value of interest the motivation 8 behind olap displays harks back to the cross tabbed report paradigm of 1980s dbms the resulting spreadsheet style display where values of x populate row 1 values of y populate column a and values of g 160 x y w populate the individual cells southeast of b2 so to speak b2 itself included edit see also computer science portal comparison of olap servers business intelligence data mining data mining extensions
