to create a cooperative computerized network for ohio libraries the group first met on july 5 1967 on the campus of ohio state university to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization 3 the group hired frederick g kilgour a former yale university medical school librarian to design the shared cataloging system 4 kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time the computer with the oldest the library his vision of an active rather than passive system where the library would go to the people was a rather revolutionary idea for 1967 the plan was to merge the catalogs of ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database in order to streamline operations control costs and increase efficiency in library management the goal of this network and database was to bring libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world s information in order to best serve researchers and scholars the first
