in artificial intelligence an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision making ability of a human expert 1 expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning about knowledge like an expert and not by following the procedure of a developer as is the case in conventional programming 2 3 4 the first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s 5 expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of ai software 6 7 8 9 10 11 an expert system has a unique structure different from traditional programs it is divided into two parts one fixed independent of the expert system the inference engine and one variable the knowledge base to run an expert system the engine reasons about the knowledge base like a human 12 in the 80s a third part appeared a dialog interface to communicate with users 13 this ability to conduct a conversation with users was later called conversational 14 15 contents 1 history 2 software architecture

in the stanford heuristic programming project including the father of expert systems with the dendral and mycin systems principal contributors to the technology were bruce buchanan edward shortliffe randall davis william vanmelle carli scott and others at stanford expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of ai software 6 7 8 9 10 11 research is also very active in france where researchers focused on the automation of reasoning and logic engines the french prolog computer language designed in 1972 marks a real advance over expert systems like dendral or mycin it is a shell 16 that is to say a software structure ready to receive any expert system and to run it prolog has an integrated inference engine using first order logic with rules and facts prolog is a tool for mass production of expert systems and was the first operational declarative language 17 later becoming the best selling ai language in the world 18 however prolog is not particularly user friendly and incorporates horn logic which is an order of logic away from human logic 19 20 21 in the 1980s expert systems proliferated as they were recognized as a practical tool for solving real world problems universities offered expert system courses and two thirds of the fortune 1000 companies applied the technology in daily business activities 5 22 interest was international with the fifth generation computer systems project in japan and increased research funding in europe growth in the field continued into the 1990s in 1981 the first ibm pc was introduced with ms dos operating system its low price started to multiply users and opened a new market for computing and expert systems in the 80 s the image of ai was very good and people believed it would succeed within a short time 15 the development of expert systems was aided by the development of the symbolic processing languages lisp and prolog to avoid re inventing the wheel expert system shells were created that had more specialized features for building large expert systems 23 many companies began to market expert systems shells from universities renamed generators because they added to the shell a tool for writing rules in plain language and thus theoretically allowed to write expert systems without a programming language nor any other software 16 the best known tools were guru usa inspired by mycin 17 18 personal consultant plus usa 19 20 nexpert object developed by neuron data company founded in california by three french 21 22 genesia developed by french public company electricit de france and marketed by steria 23 vp expert usa 24 but eventually the tools were only used in research projects they did not penetrate the business market showing that ai technology was not mature in 1986 a new expert system generator for pcs appeared on the market derived from the french academic research intelligence service 24 25 sold by gsi tecsi software company this software had a radical innovation it used propositional logic zeroth order logic to execute expert systems reasoning on a knowledge base written with everyday language rules producing explanations and detecting logic contradictions between the facts it was the first tool showing the ai defined by edward feigenbaum in his book about the japanese fifth generation project artificial intelligence and japan s computer challenge to the world 1983 the machines will have reasoning power they will automatically engineer vast amounts of knowledge to serve whatever purpose humans propose from medical diagnosis to product design from management decisions to education the reasoning animal has perhaps inevitably fashioned the reasoning machine the reasoning power of these machines matches or exceeds the reasoning power of the humans who instructed them and in some cases the reasoning power of any human performing such tasks intelligence service was in fact pandora 1985 26 a software system developed for their thesis by two academic students of jean louis lauri re 27 one of the most famous and prolific french ai researchers 28 unfortunately as this software was not developed by its own it developers gsi tecsi was unable to make it evolve sales became scarce and marketing stopped after a few years edit software architecture edit the rule base or knowledge base in expert system technology the knowledge base is expressed with natural language rules if then for examples 160 if it is living then it is mortal if his age known then his year of birth current year his age in years if the identity of the germ is not known with certainty and the germ is gram positive and the morphology of the organism is rod and the germ is aerobic then there is a strong probability 0 8 that the germ is of type enterobacteriacae 29 this formulation has the advantage of speaking in everyday language which is very rare in computer science a classic program is coded rules express the knowledge to be exploited by the expert system there exist other formulations of rules which are not in everyday language understandable only to computer scientists each rule style is adapted to an engine style edit the inference engine the inference engine is a computer program designed to produce a reasoning on rules in order to produce a reasoning it should be based on logic there are several kinds of logic propositional logic predicates of order 1 or more epistemic logic modal logic temporal logic fuzzy logic etc except for propositional logic all are complex and can only be understood by mathematicians logicians or computer scientists propositional logic is the basic human logic that is expressed in syllogisms the expert system that uses that logic is also called a zeroth order expert system with logic the engine is able to generate new information from the knowledge contained in the rule base and data to be processed the engine has two ways to run batch or conversational in batch the expert system has all the necessary data to process from the beginning for the user the program works as a classical program he provides data and receives results immediately reasoning is invisible the conversational method becomes necessary when the developer knows he cannot ask the user for all the necessary data at the start the problem being too complex the software must invent the way to solve the problem request the missing data from the user gradually approaching the goal as quickly as possible the result gives the impression of a dialogue led by an expert to guide a dialogue the engine may have several levels of sophistication forward chaining backward chaining and mixed chaining forward chaining is the questioning of an expert who has no idea of the solution and investigates progressively e g fault diagnosis in backward chaining the engine has an idea of the target e g is it okay or not or there is danger but what is the level it starts from the goal in hopes of finding the solution as soon as possible in mixed chaining the engine has an idea of the goal but it is not enough it deduces in forward chaining from previous user responses all that is possible before asking the next question so quite often he deduces the answer to the next question before asking it a strong interest in using logic is that this kind of software is able to give the user clear explanation of what it is doing the why and what it has deduced the how better yet thanks to logic the most sophisticated expert systems are able to detect contradictions 30 in user information or in the knowledge and can explain them clearly revealing at the same time the expert s knowledge and way of thinking edit advantages this section does not cite any references or sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed november 2011 this article may need to be rewritten entirely to comply with wikipedia s quality standards as section you can help the discussion page may contain suggestions december 2011 edit conversational expert systems offer many advantages for users when compared to traditional programs because they operate like a human brain 31 32 edit quick availability and opportunity to program itself as the rule base is in everyday language the engine is untouchable expert system can be written much faster than a conventional program by users or experts bypassing professional developers and avoiding the need to explain the subject edit ability to exploit a considerable amount of knowledge the expert system uses a rule base unlike conventional programs which means that the volume of knowledge to program is not a major concern whether the rule base has 10 rules or 10 000 the engine operation is the same edit reliability the reliability of an expert system is the same as the reliability of a database i e good higher than that of a classical program it also depends on the size of knowledge base edit scalability evolving an expert system is to add modify or delete rules since the rules are written in plain language it is easy to identify those to be removed or modified edit pedagogy the engines that are run by a true logic are able to explain to the user in plain language why they ask a question and how they arrived at each deduction in doing so they show knowledge of the expert contained in the expert system so user can learn this knowledge in its context moreover they can communicate their deductions step by step so the user has information about their problem even before the final answer of the expert system edit preservation and improvement of knowledge valuable knowledge can disappear with the death resignation or retirement of an expert recorded in an expert system it becomes eternal to develop an expert system is to interview an expert and make the system aware of their knowledge in doing so it reflects and enhances it edit new areas neglected by conventional computing automating a vast knowledge the developer may meet a classic problem combinatorial explosion commonly known as information overload that greatly complicates his work and results in a complex and time consuming program the reasoning expert system does not encounter that problem since the engine automatically loads combinatorics between rules this ability can address areas where combinatorics are enormous highly interactive or conversational applications fault diagnosis decision support in complex systems educational software logic simulation of machines or systems constantly changing software edit disadvantages this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may 2012 every expert system has a major flaw which explains its low success despite the principles that it is based upon having existed for 70 years knowledge collection and its interpretation into rules or knowledge engineering most developers have no automated method to perform this task instead they work manually increasing the likelihood of errors expert knowledge is generally not well understood for example rules may not exist be contradictory or be poorly written and unusable worse still most expert systems use a computational engine incapable of reasoning as a result an expert system will often work poorly and the project will be abandoned 33 correct development methodology can mitigate these problems there exists software capable of interviewing a true expert on a subject and automatically writing the rule base or knowledge base from the answers the expert system can then be simultaneously run before the true expert s eyes performing a consistency of rules check 34 35 36 experts and users can check the quality of the software before it is finished many expert systems are also penalized by the logic used most formal systems of logic operate on variable facts i e facts the value of which changes several times during one reasoning this is considered a property belonging to more powerful logic this is the case of the mycin and dendral expert systems and of for example fuzzy logic predicate logic prolog symbolic logic and mathematical logic propositional logic uses only invariant facts 37 in the human mind the facts used must remain invariable as long as the brain reasons with them this makes possible two ways of controlling the consistency of the knowledge detection of contradictions and production of explanations 38 39 that is why expert systems using variable facts which are more understandable to developers creating such systems and hence more common are less easy to develop less clear to users less reliable and why they don t produce explanations of their reasoning or contradiction detection edit application field expert systems address areas where combinatorics is enormous highly interactive or conversational applications ivr voice server chatterbot fault diagnosis medical diagnosis decision support in complex systems process control interactive user guide educational and tutorial software logic simulation of machines or systems knowledge management constantly changing software they can also be used in software engineering for rapid prototyping applications rad indeed the expert system quickly developed in front of the expert shows him if the future application should be programmed indeed any program contains expert knowledge and classic programming always begins with an expert interview a program written in the form of expert system receives all the specific benefits of expert system among others things it can be developed by anyone without computer training and without programming languages but this solution has a defect expert system runs slower than a traditional program because he consistently thinks when in fact a classic software just follows paths traced by the programmer edit examples of applications expert systems are designed to facilitate tasks in the fields of accounting the law medicine process control financial service production human resources among others typically the problem area is complex enough that a more simple traditional algorithm cannot provide a proper solution the foundation of a successful expert system depends on a series of technical procedures and development that may be designed by technicians and related experts as such expert systems do not typically provide a definitive answer but provide probabilistic recommendations an example of the application of expert systems in the financial field is expert systems for mortgages loan departments are interested in expert systems for mortgages because of the growing cost of labour which makes the handling and acceptance of relatively small loans less profitable they also see a possibility for standardized efficient handling of mortgage loan by applying expert systems appreciating that for the acceptance of mortgages there are hard and fast rules which do not always exist with other types of loans another common application in the financial area for expert systems are in trading recommendations in various marketplaces these markets involve numerous variables and human emotions which may be impossible to deterministically characterize thus expert systems based on the rules of thumb from experts and simulation data are used expert system of this type can range from ones providing regional retail recommendations like wishabi to ones used to assist monetary decisions by financial institutions and governments another 1970s and 1980s application of expert systems which we today would simply call ai was in computer games for example the computer baseball games earl weaver baseball and tony la russa baseball each had highly detailed simulations of the game strategies of those two baseball managers when a human played the game against the computer the computer queried the earl weaver or tony la russa expert system for a decision on what strategy to follow even those choices where some randomness was part of the natural system such as when to throw a surprise pitch out to try to trick a runner trying to steal a base were decided based on probabilities supplied by weaver or la russa today we would simply say that the game s ai provided the opposing manager s strategy a new application for expert systems is automated computer program generation funded by a us air force grant an expert system based application hprcarchitect that generates computer programs for mixed processor technology fpga gpu multicore systems without a need for technical specialists has recently been commercially introduced there is also a large body of contemporary research and development directed toward using expert systems for human behavior modeling and decision support systems the former is especially important in the area of intercultural relations and the latter in improving management operations in small businesses edit knowledge engineering main article knowledge engineering the building maintaining and development of expert systems is known as knowledge engineering 40 knowledge engineering is a discipline that involves integrating knowledge into computer systems in order to solve complex problems normally requiring a high level of human expertise 41 there are generally three individuals having an interaction in an expert system primary among these is the end user the individual who uses the system for its problem solving assistance in the construction and maintenance of the system there are two other roles the problem domain expert who builds the system and supplies the knowledge base and a knowledge engineer who assists the experts in determining the representation of their knowledge enters this knowledge into an explanation module and who defines the inference technique required to solve the problem usually the knowledge engineer will represent the problem solving activity in the form of rules when these rules are created from domain expertise the knowledge base stores the rules of the expert system edit
