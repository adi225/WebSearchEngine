pseudoscience technoscience science portal category v t e computational science also scientific computing or scientific computation is concerned with constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems 1 in practical use it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation from numerical analysis and theoretical computer science to problems in various scientific disciplines the field is different from theory and laboratory experiment which are the traditional forms of science and engineering the scientific computing approach is to gain understanding mainly through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers scientists and engineers develop computer programs application software that model systems being studied and run these programs with various sets of input parameters typically these models require massive amounts of calculations usually floating point and are often executed on supercomputers or distributed computing platforms numerical analysis is an important underpinning for techniques used in computational science contents 1 applications of

methods and algorithms algorithms and mathematical methods used in computational science are varied commonly applied methods include numerical analysis application of taylor series as convergent and asymptotic series computing derivatives by automatic differentiation ad computing derivatives by finite differences graph theoretic suites high order difference approximations via taylor series and richardson extrapolation methods of integration on a uniform mesh rectangle rule also called midpoint rule trapezoid rule simpson s rule runge kutta method for solving ordinary differential equations monte carlo methods molecular dynamics linear programming branch and cut branch and bound numerical linear algebra computing the lu factors by gaussian elimination cholesky factorizations discrete fourier transform and applications newton s method time stepping methods for dynamical systems programming languages and computer algebra systems commonly used for the more mathematical aspects of scientific computing applications include r programming language matlab mathematica 2 scilab gnu octave python programming language with scipy and pdl citation needed the more computationally intensive aspects of scientific computing will often utilize some variation of c or fortran and optimized algebra libraries such as blas or lapack computational science application programs often model real world changing conditions such as weather air flow around a plane automobile body distortions in a crash the motion of stars in a galaxy an explosive device etc such programs might create a logical mesh in computer memory where each item corresponds to an area in space and contains information about that space relevant to the model for example in weather models each item might be a square kilometer with land elevation current wind direction humidity temperature pressure etc the program would calculate the likely next state based on the current state in simulated time steps solving equations that describe how the system operates and then repeat the process to calculate the next state the term computational scientist is used to describe someone skilled in scientific computing this person is usually a scientist an engineer or an applied mathematician who applies high performance computers in different ways to advance the state of the art in their respective applied disciplines in physics chemistry or engineering scientific computing has increasingly also impacted on other areas including economics biology and medicine computational science is now commonly considered a third mode of science complementing and adding to experimentation observation and theory 3 the essence of computational science is numerical algorithm 4 and or computational mathematics 5 in fact substantial effort in computational sciences has been devoted to the development of algorithms the efficient implementation in programming languages and validation of computational results a collection of problems and solutions in computational science can be found in steeb hardy hardy and stoop 2004 6 edit reproducibility and open research computing the complexity of computational methods is a threat to the reproducibility of research jon claerbout has become prominent for pointing out that reproducible research requires archiving and documenting all raw data and all code used to obtain a result 7 8 9 nick barnes in the science code manifesto proposed five principles that should be followed when software is used in open science publication 10 tomi kauppinen et al established and defined linked open science an approach to interconnect scientific assets to enable transparent reproducible and transdisciplinary research 11 edit journals most scientific journals do not accept software papers because a description of a reasonably mature software usually does not meet the criterion of novelty outside computer science itself there are only few journals dedicated to scientific software established journals like elsevier s computer physics communications publish papers that are not open access though the described software usually is to fill this gap a new journal entitled open research computation was announced in 2010 12 it closed in 2012 without having published a single paper for a lack of submissions probably due to excessive quality requirements 13 a new initiative was launched in 2012 the journal of open research software 14 edit education scientific computation is most often studied through an applied mathematics or computer science program or within a standard mathematics sciences or engineering program at some institutions a specialization in scientific computation can be earned as a minor within another program which may be at varying levels however there are increasingly many bachelor s and master s programs in computational science some schools also offer the ph d in computational science
