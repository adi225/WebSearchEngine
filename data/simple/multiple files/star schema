in computing the star schema also called star join schema data cube or multi dimensional schema is the simplest style of data warehouse schema the star schema consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables the star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema and is more effective for handling simpler queries 1 contents 1 model 1 1 benefits 2 example 3 see also 4 references 5 external links edit model a star schema classifies the attributes of an event into facts measured numeric time data and descriptive dimension attributes product id customer name sale date that give the facts a context a fact record is the nexus between the specific dimension values and the recorded facts the facts are stored at a uniform level of detail the grain in the fact table dimension attributes are organized into affinity groups and stored in a minimal number of dimension tables a weather star schema that records weather data may have facts of temperature barometric pressure wind speed precipitation cloud cover etc and dimensions of location date time reporter etc star schemas are designed to optimize user ease of use and retrieval performance by minimizing the number of tables to join to materialize a transaction a star schema is called such as it comprises a constellation of stars generally several bright stars facts surrounded by dimmer ones dimensions the fact table holds the metric values recorded for a specific event because of the desire to hold atomic level data there generally are a very large number of records perhaps billions special care is taken to minimize the number and size of attributes in order to constrain the overall table size and maintain performance fact tables generally come in 3 flavors transaction facts about a specific event e g sale snapshot facts recorded at a point in time e g account details at month end and accumulating snapshot tables e g month to date sales for a product dimension tables usually have few records compared to fact tables but may have a very large number of attributes that describe the fact data often there can be dozens to hundreds of dimension attributes describing the various facets of a fact dimension attributes are organized into tables of loosely related attributes that share a known or unknown affinity attributes of color style size texture can describe a product and would be included in a product dimension table dimension tables include attributes that typically would be normalized into separate tables snowflake schema for example in the us a location can be identified by a zipcode that exists within a neighborhood city state region all of these attributes would be included in a location dimension table on an entity relationship er diagram fact tables have few distinct columns while dimension tables have a large number of columns however most of the storage is used by the fact table dimension tables are assigned a surrogate primary key of a simple integer that is assigned to the combination of low level attributes that form the natural key fact tables should also have a single surrogate primary key to allow for situations where there may be two or more facts having exactly the same set of dimension keys a star schema that has many dimensions is sometimes called a centipede schema 2 having dimensions of only a few attributes while simpler to maintain results in queries with many table joins and makes the star schema less easy to use edit benefits the primary benefit of a star schema is its simplicity for users to write and databases to process queries are written with simple inner joins between the facts and a small number of dimensions star joins are simpler than possible in snowflake schema where conditions need only to filter on the attributes desired and aggregations are fast the star schema is a way to implement multidimensional database mddb functionality using a mainstream relational database edit example star schema used by example query consider a database of sales perhaps from a store chain classified by date store and product the image of the schema to the right is a star schema version of the sample schema provided in the snowflake schema article fact sales is the fact table and there are three dimension tables dim date dim store and dim product each dimension table has a primary key on its id column relating to one of the columns viewed as rows in the example schema of the fact sales table s three column compound primary key date id store id product id the non primary key units sold column of the fact table in this example represents a measure or metric that can be used in calculations and analysis the non primary key columns of the dimension tables represent additional attributes of the dimensions such as the year of the dim date dimension for example the following query answers how many tv sets have been sold for each brand and country in 1997 select p brand s country sum f units sold from fact sales f inner join dim date d on f date id d id inner join dim store s on f store id s id inner join dim product p on f product id p id where d year 1997 and p product category tv group by p brand s country edit see also reverse star schema snowflake schema edit references dwh schemas 2009 http www dwhworld com dwh schemas ralph kimball and margy
