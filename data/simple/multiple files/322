knime stable release 2 7 december 06 2012 os windows linux macintosh license gnu general public license website http www knime org knime the konstanz information miner is an open source data analytics reporting and integration platform knime integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept a graphical user interface allows assembly of nodes for data preprocessing etl extraction transformation loading for modeling and data analysis and visualization since 2006 knime is used in pharmaceutical research 1 but is also used in other areas like crm customer data analysis business intelligence and financial data analysis contents 1 history 2 internals 3 license 4 see also 5 references 6 external links edit history the development of knime was started january 2004 by a team of software engineers at konstanz university as a proprietary product the original developer team headed by michael berthold came from a company in the silicon valley providing software for the pharmaceutical industry knime has been developed from day one using rigorous professional software engineering processes since it was clear from the beginning that it was to be used in large scale enterprises the initial goal was to create a modular highly scalable and open data processing platform which allowed for the easy integration of different data loading processing transformation analysis and visual exploration modules without the focus on any particular application area the platform was intended to be a collaboration and research platform and should also serve as an integration platform for various other data analysis projects in 2006 the first version of knime was released and several pharmaceutical companies started using knime and a number of life science software vendors began integrating their tools into knime 2 3 4 5 6 7 later that year after an article in the german magazine c t 8 users from a number of other areas 9 10 joined ship as of fall 2010 knime is in use by over 5 000 actual users i e not counting downloads but users regularly retrieving updates when they become available not only in the life sciences but also at banks publishers consulting firms and various other industries but also at a large number of research groups worldwide a screenshot of knime edit internals knime allows users to visually create data flows or pipelines selectively execute some or all analysis steps and later inspect the results models and interactive views knime is written in java and based on eclipse and makes use of its extension mechanism to add plugins providing additional functionality the core version already includes hundreds of modules for data integration file i o database nodes supporting all common database management systems data transformation filter converter combiner as well as the commonly used methods for data analysis and visualization with the free report designer extension knime workflows can be used as data sets to create report templates that can be exported to document formats like doc ppt xls pdf and others other capabilities of knime are knimes core architecture allows processing of large data volumes that are only limited by the available hard disk space most other open source data analysis tools are working in main memory and are therefore limited to the available ram e g knime allows analysis of 300 million customer addresses 20 million cell images and 10 million molecular structures additional plugins allows the integration of methods for text mining image mining as well as time series analysis knime integrates various other open source projects e g machine learning algorithms from weka the statistics package r as well as libsvm jfreechart imagej and the chemistry development kit knime is implemented in java but also allows for wrappers calling other code in addition to providing nodes that allow to run java python perl and other code fragments edit license as of version 2 1 knime is released under gplv3 with an exception that allows others to use the well defined node api to add proprietary extensions 11 this allows also commercial sw vendors to add wrappers calling their tools to knime edit see also weka machine learning algorithms that can be integrated in knime elki data mining framework with many clustering algorithms edit
