hollerith 1890 tabulating machine and sorter hollerith punched card the tabulating machine was an electromechanical machine designed to assist in summarizing information and later accounting invented by herman hollerith the machine was developed to help process data for the 1890 u s census it spawned a class of machines known as unit record equipment and the data processing industry the term super computing was first used by the new york world newspaper in 1931 to refer to a large custom built tabulator that ibm made for columbia university 1 contents 1 1890 census 2 following the 1890 census 3

available they were clearly obsolete due to rapid growth of the u s population from 1880 to 1890 primarily because of immigration it was estimated that the 1890 census would take approximately 13 years to complete an immense logistical problem since the u s constitution mandates a census every ten years to apportion taxation between the states and to determine congressional representation a faster method was necessary in the late 1880s herman hollerith inspired by conductors using holes punched in different positions on a railway ticket to record traveler details such as gender and approximate age invented the recording of data on a machine readable medium prior uses of machine readable media had been for lists of instructions not data to drive programmed machines such as jacquard looms and mechanized musical instruments after some initial trials with paper tape he settled on punched cards 2 hollerith used punched cards with round holes 12 rows and 24 columns his tabulator used electromechanical relays and solenoids to increment mechanical counters a set of spring loaded wires were suspended over the card reader the card sat over pools of mercury pools corresponding to the possible hole positions in the card when the wires were pressed onto the card punched holes allowed wires to dip into the mercury pools making an electrical contact 3 that could be used for counting sorting and setting off a bell to let the operator know the card had been read the tabulator had 40 counters each with a dial divided into 100 divisions with two indicator hands one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution this arrangement allowed a count up to 10 000 during a given tabulating run counters could be assigned a specific hole or using relay logic a of combination of holes e g to count married females 4 if the card was to be sorted a compartment lid of the sorting box would open for storage of the card the choice of compartment depending on the data in the card 5 hollerith s method was used for the 1890 census the cards were coded for age state of residence gender and other information clerks used keypunches to punch holes in the cards to enter information from the returns the census results were finished months ahead of schedule and far under budget 6 edit following the 1890 census the advantages of the technology were immediately apparent for accounting and tracking inventory hollerith started his own business in 1896 founding the tabulating machine company in that year he introduced the hollerith integrating tabulator which could add numbers coded on cards not just count the number of holes cards were still read manually using the pins and mercury pool reader 1900 saw the hollerith automatic feed tabulator used in that year s u s census a control panel was incorporated in the 1906 type 160 1 7 in 1911 four corporations including hollerith s firm merged to form the computing tabulating recording company ctr tabulators that could print and with removable control panels appeared in the 1920s in 1924 ctr was renamed international business machines ibm ibm continued to develop faster and more sophisticated tabulators culminating in the 1949 ibm 407 tabulating machines continued to be used well after the introduction of commercial electronic computers in the 1950s many applications using unit record tabulators were migrated to computers such as the ibm 1401 two programming languages fargo and rpg were created to aid this migration since tabulator control panels were based on the machine cycle both fargo and rpg emulated the notion of the machine cycle and training material showed the control panel vs programming language coding sheet relationships edit operation main article plugboard ibm type 285 8 tabulators in use at u s social security administration circa 1936 early ibm tabulating machine powers samas accounting machine in its basic form a tabulating machine would read one card at a time print portions fields of the card on fan fold paper possibly rearranged and add one or more numbers punched on the card to one or more counters called accumulators on early models the accumulator register dials would be read manually after a card run to get totals later models could print totals directly cards with a particular punch could be treated as master cards causing different behavior for example customer master cards could be merged with sorted cards recording individual items purchased when read by the tabulating machine to create invoices the billing address and customer number would be printed from the master card then individual items purchased and their price would be printed when the next master card was detected the total price would be printed from the accumulator and the page ejected to the top of the next page typically using a carriage control tape with successive stages or cycles of punched card processing fairly complex calculations could be made if one had a sufficient set of equipment in modern data processing terms one can think of each stage as an sql clause select filter columns then where filter cards or rows then maybe a group by for totals and counts then a sort by and then perhaps feed those back to another set of select and where cycles again if needed a human operator had to retrieve load and store the various card decks at each stage edit models and timeline hollerith s first tabulators were used for the u s 1890 census 9 the first ctr automatic feed tabulator operating at 150 cards minute was developed in 1906 10 the first ctr printing tabulator was developed in 1920 11 ibm 301 type iv accounting machine from the ibm archives the 301 better known as the type iv accounting machine was the first card controlled machine to incorporate class selection automatic subtraction and printing of a net positive or negative balance dating to 1928 this machine exemplifies the transition from tabulating to accounting machines the type iv could list 100 cards per minute h w egli bull tabulator model t30 1931 ibm 401 from the ibm archives the 401 introduced in 1933 was an early entry in a long series of ibm alphabetic tabulators and accounting machines it was developed by a team headed by j r peirce and incorporated significant functions and features invented by a w mills f j furman and e j rabenda the 401 added at a speed of 150 cards per minute and listed alphanumerical data at 80 cards per minute ibm 405 photo from the ibm archives introduced in 1934 the 405 alphabetical accounting machine was the basic bookkeeping and accounting machine marketed by ibm for many years important features were expanded adding capacity greater flexibility of counter grouping 12 direct printing of the entire alphabet direct subtraction 13 and printing of either debit or credit balance from any counter commonly called the 405 tabulator this machine remained the flagship of ibm s product line until after world war ii ibm 402 and 403 from 1948 were modernized successors to the 405 control panel for an ibm 402 accounting machine bull bs pr tabulating machine the 1952 bull gamma 3 could be attached to this tabulator or to a card read punch 14 ibm 407 introduced in 1949 it was later adapted to serve as an input output peripheral for a number of early electronic calculators and computers its printing mechanism was used with the ibm 1130 through the mid 1970s the ibm 407 accounting machine was withdrawn from marketing in 1976
