for suggestions september 2008 information overload nicknamed infobesity is a term popularized by alvin toffler in his bestselling 1970 book future shock it refers to the difficulty a person can have understanding an issue and making decisions that can be caused by the presence of too much information 1 the term itself is mentioned in a 1964 book by bertram gross the managing of organizations 2 information overload occurs when the amount of input to a system exceeds its processing capacity decision makers have fairly limited cognitive processing capacity consequently when information overload occurs it is likely that a reduction in decision quality will occur 3 the term and concept precede the internet and can be viewed from a library and information sciences perspective 4 or viewed as a psychology phenomenon 5 in psychology information overload relates to an overabundance of incoming information into the senses 5 toffler s explanation of it presents information overload as the information age s version of sensory overload a term that had been introduced in the 1950s 6 sensory overload was thought to cause disorientation and lack of responsiveness toffler posited information overload as having the same sorts of effects but on the higher cognitive functions writing when the individual is plunged into a fast and irregularly changing situation or a novelty loaded context his predictive accuracy plummets he can no longer make the reasonably correct assessments on which rational behavior is dependent 7 as the world moves into a new era of globalization an increasing number of people are connecting to the internet to conduct their own research 8 and are given the ability to produce as well as consume the data accessed on an increasing number of websites 9 10 users are now classified as active users 11 because more people in society are participating in the digital and information age 12 more and more people are considered to be active writers and viewers because of their participation 13 this flow has created a new life where we are now in danger of becoming dependent on this method of access to information 14 15 therefore we see an information overload from the access to so much information almost instantaneously without knowing the validity of the content and the risk of misinformation 16 17 according to sonora jha of seattle university journalists are using the web to conduct their research getting information regarding interviewing sources and press releases updating news online and thus it shows the gradual shifts in attitudes because of the rapid increase in use of the internet 18 lawrence lessig has described this as the read write nature of the internet 19 the resulting abundance of and desire for more and or higher quality information has come to be perceived in some circles paradoxically as the source of as much productivity loss as gain 20 information overload can lead to information anxiety which is the gap between the information we understand and the information that we think that we must understand as people consume increasing amounts of information in the form of news stories e mails blog posts facebook statuses tweets tumblr posts and other new sources of information they become their own editors gatekeepers and aggregators of information 21 one concern in this field is that massive amounts of information can be distracting and negatively impact productivity and decision making another concern is the contamination of useful information with information that might not be entirely accurate information pollution research done is often done with the view that io is a problem that can be understood in a rational way 20 contents 1 origin 2 history 2 1 early history 2 2 renaissance

references edit origin a quite early example of the term information overload can be found in an article by jacob jacoby donald speller and carol kohn berning who conducted an experiment on 192 housewives which was said to confirm the hypothesis that more information about brands would lead to poorer decision making 22 long before that the concept was introduced by diderot although it wasn t by the term information overload as long as the centuries continue to unfold the number of books will grow continually and one can predict that a time will come when it will be almost as difficult to learn anything from books as from the direct study of the whole universe it will be almost as convenient to search for some bit of truth concealed in nature as it will be to find it hidden away in an immense multitude of bound volumes denis diderot encyclop die 1755 edit history edit early history information overload has been documented throughout periods where advances in technology have increased a production of information 23 as early as the 3rd or 4th century bc people regarded information overload with disapproval 23 around this time in ecclesiastes 12 12 the passage revealed the writer s comment of making books there is no end and in 1st century ad seneca the elder commented that the abundance of books is distraction 23 similar complaints around the growth of books were also mentioned in china 24 edit renaissance around 1440 ad johannes gutenberg invented the printing press and this marked another period of information proliferation as a result of lowering production costs generation of printed materials ranging from pamphlets manuscripts to books were made available to the average person 23 25 scholars complained about the abundance of information for a variety of reasons such as the diminishing quality of text as printers rushed to print manuscripts and they also felt the supply of new information was distracting and difficult to manage 23 edit information age in the second half of the 20th century advances in computer and information technology led to the creation of the internet in the modern information age information overload is experienced as distracting and unmanageable information such as email spam email notifications instant messages tweets and facebook updates in the context of the work environment 26 social media has resulted in social information overload which can occur on sites like facebook 27 and technology is changing to serve our social culture proposals to deal with or solve io should also be examined by looking at the context of culture and the social interactions between people edit general causes the general causes of information overload include a rapidly increasing rate of new information being produced also known as journalism of assertion which is a continuous news culture where there is a premium put on how quickly news can be put out which leads to a competitive advantage in news reporting but this affects the quality of the news stories 28 the ease of duplication and transmission of data across the internet an increase in the available channels of incoming information e g telephone e mail instant messaging rss large amounts of historical information to dig through contradictions and inaccuracies in available information a low signal to noise ratio a lack of a method for comparing and processing different kinds of information the pieces of information are unrelated or do not have any overall structure to reveal their relationships e mail remains a major source of information overload as people struggle to keep up with the rate of incoming messages as well as filtering out unsolicited commercial messages spam users also have to contend with the growing use of email attachments in the form of lengthy reports presentations and media files a december 2007 new york times blog post described e mail as a 650 billion drag on the economy 29 and the new york times reported in april 2008 that e mail has become the bane of some people s professional lives due to information overload yet none of the current wave of high profile internet startups focused on email really eliminates the problem of e mail overload because none helps us prepare replies 30 in january 2011 eve tahmincioglu a writer for msnbc wrote an article titled dealing with a bloated inbox compiling statistics with expert commentary she reported that there were 294 billion emails sent each day in 2010 up 50 billion from 2009 quoted in the article workplace productivity expert marsha egan stated that people need to differentiate between working on e mail and sorting through it this meant that rather than responding to every email right away users should delete unnecessary emails and sort the others into action or reference folders first egan then went on to say we are more wired than ever before and as a result need to be more mindful of managing email or it will end up managing us 31 the daily telegraph quoted nicholas carr former executive editor of the harvard business review and the author of the shallows what the internet is doing to our brains as saying that email exploits a basic human instinct to search for new information causing people to become addicted to mindlessly pressing levers in the hope of receiving a pellet of social or intellectual nourishment his concern is shared by eric schmidt chief executive of google who stated that instantaneous devices and the abundance of information people are exposed to through e mail and other technology based sources could be having an impact on the thought process obstructing deep thinking understanding impedes the formation of memories and makes learning more difficult this condition of cognitive overload results in diminished information retaining ability and failing to connect remembrances to experiences stored in the long term memory leaving thoughts thin and scattered 32 this is also manifest in the education process 33 technology investors reflect similar concerns 34 in addition to e mail the world wide web has provided access to billions of pages of information in many offices workers are given unrestricted access to the web allowing them to manage their own research the use of search engines helps users to find information quickly however information published online may not always be reliable due to the lack of authority approval or a compulsory accuracy check before publication this results in people having to cross check what they read before using it for decision making which takes up more time edit responses edit response of business and government this section does not cite any references or sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed january 2008 many academics corporate decision makers and federal policy makers recognize the magnitude and growing impact of this phenomenon in june 2008 a group of interested researchers from a diverse set of corporations smaller companies academic institutions and consultancies created the information overload research group iorg a non profit interest group dedicated to raising awareness sharing research results and promoting the creation of solutions around information overload 35 recent research suggests that an attention economy of sorts will naturally emerge from information overload 36 allowing internet users greater control over their online experience with particular regard to communication mediums such as e mail and instant messaging this could involve some sort of cost being attached to e mail messages for example managers charging a small fee for every e mail received e g 5 00 which the sender must pay from their budget the aim of such charging is to force the sender to consider the necessity of the interruption however such a suggestion undermines the entire basis of the popularity of e mail namely that e mails are free economics often assumes that people are rational in that they have the knowledge of their preferences and an ability to look for the best possible ways to maximize his preferences people are seen as selfish and focus on what pleases them looking at various parts on their own results in the negligence of the other parts that work alongside it that create the effect of io lincoln suggests possible ways to look at io in a more holistic approach by recognizing the many possible factors that play a role in io and how they work together to achieve io 20 edit dealing with information overload there are various methods that can be used to alleviate io it is difficult to say if there is a solution that can solve the issue altogether but many methods have been suggested however there is a large amount of advice available as well as methods to help alleviate io but they are subjective in that they can serve different personal opinions and preferences johnson advises discipline and for the elimination of push or notifications he explains that notifications pull people s attentions away from their work and into social networks and e mails he also advises that people stop using their iphones as alarm clocks which means that the phone is the first thing that people will see when they wake up leading to people checking their e mail right away 37 the use of internet applications and add ons such as the inbox pause add on for gmail 38 this add on doesn t reduce the amount of e mails that people get but it pauses the inbox burkeman in his article talks about the feeling of being in control is the way to deal with information overload which might involve self deception he advises to fight irrationality with irrationality by using add ons that allow you to pause your inbox or produce other results reducing large amounts of information is key dealing with io from a social network site such as facebook a study done by humboldt university 39 showed some strategies that students take to try and alleviate io while using facebook some of these strategies included prioritizing updates from friends who were physically farther away in other countries hiding updates from less prioritized friends deleting people from their friends list narrowing the amount of personal information shared and deactivating the facebook account attention philanthropy is considered to be a gift of notice 40 that is focused on shining a light on work that s worth supporting yet falls outside the notice of the usual sources of funding or acclaim it places an importance on money but more important than the money is the exposure and the attention for good initiatives in the midst of all the initiatives that are created there is an emphasis placed on the little guy attention philanthropy does face some difficulties for example certain initiatives can turn into popularity contests where feel good ideas are supported that is not to say that these initiatives are bad but that a popularity contest between initiatives don t guarantee the effectiveness of the initiative the desired outcome of attention philanthropy is to increase the flow of world changing projects and people into the system and connect the mainstream to the leading waves of innovation and speeding the uptake of good ideas throughout society edit media media like the internet are conducting research to promote awareness of information overload in 41 kyunghye kim mia liza a lustria darrell burke and nahyun kwon conducted a study regarding people who have encountered information overload while searching for health information about cancer and what the impact on them was the conclusion drawn from the research discusses how health information should be distributed and that information campaigns should be held to prevent irrelevant or incorrect information being circulated on the internet other than that there are many books published to encourage awareness of information overload and to train the reader to process information more consciously and effectively books like surviving information overload by kevin a miller managing information overload by lynn lively 42 and the principle of relevance by stefania lucchetti deal effectively with the topic 43 clay johnson technologist the author of the book the information diet uses a metaphor for information overload by comparing the information we consume to a diet the idea is that people tend to consume the information that they find to be interesting which he says is similar to people eating desert first the use of social networks blogs and online videos has accentuated this because people share what they find interesting with all their friends online causing it to spread there is a need to create cheap popular information and this is how the media has defined itself today by producing information like this he compares it to the food industry which industrialized and created incentives for producing a large amount of cheap popular calories 37 edit the problem of organization some cognitive scientists and graphic designers have emphasized the distinction between raw information and information in a form we can use in thinking in this view information overload may be better viewed as organization underload that is they suggest that the problem is not so much the volume of information but the fact that we can t discern how to use it well in the raw or biased form it is presented to us authors who have taken this tack include graphic artist and architect richard saul wurman the man who coined the phrase information architect and statistician and cognitive scientist edward tufte wurman uses the term information anxiety to describe our attitude toward the volume of information in general and our limitations in processing it tufte primarily focuses on quantitative information and explores ways to organize large complex datasets visually to facilitate clear thinking edit related terms a similar term information pollution was coined by jakob nielsen when the term interruption overload has begun to appear in newspapers such as the
