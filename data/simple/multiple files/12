forward through commercials additionally as more seasons of pre recorded box sets are offered for sale of television programs fewer people watch the shows on tv however the fact that these sets are sold means the company will receive additional profits from the sales of these sets to counter this effect a variety of strategies have been employed many advertisers have opted for product placement on tv shows like survivor other strategies include integrating advertising with internet connected epgs advertising on companion devices like smartphones and tablets during the show and creating tv apps additionally some like brands have opted for social television sponsorship citation needed edit advertising education advertising education has become widely popular with bachelor master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis citation needed a surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes such as the advance of online social networking a unique model for teaching advertising is the student run advertising agency where advertising students create campaigns for real companies 50 organizations such as american advertising federation and adu network partner established companies with students to create these campaigns edit criticisms main article criticism of advertising while advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth it is not without social costs unsolicited commercial e mail and other forms of spam have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services as well as being a financial burden on internet service providers 51 advertising is increasingly invading public spaces such as schools which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation 52 53 in addition advertising frequently uses psychological pressure for example appealing to feelings of inadequacy on the intended consumer which may be harmful many even feel that often advertisements exploit the desires of a consumer by making a particular product more appealing by manipulating the consumers needs and wants edit regulation main article advertising regulation there have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising some examples are the ban on television tobacco advertising imposed in many countries and the total ban of advertising to children under 12 imposed by the swedish government in 1991 though that regulation continues in effect for broadcasts originating within the country it has been weakened by the european court of justice which had found that sweden was obliged to accept foreign programming including those from neighboring countries or via satellite greece s regulations are of a similar nature banning advertisements for children s toys between 7 am and 10 pm and a total ban on advertisement for war toys 54 in europe and elsewhere there is a vigorous debate on whether or how much advertising to children should be regulated this debate was exacerbated by a report released by the kaiser family foundation in february 2004 which suggested fast food advertising that targets children was an important factor in the epidemic of childhood obesity in the united states in new zealand south africa pakistan afghanistan canada and many european countries the advertising industry operates a system of self regulation advertisers advertising agencies and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold the general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is legal decent honest and truthful some self regulatory organizations are funded by the industry but remain independent with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the advertising standards authority in the uk in the uk most forms of outdoor advertising such as the display of billboards is regulated by the uk town and county planning system currently the display of an advertisement without consent from the planning authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of 2 500 per offence all of the major outdoor billboard companies in the uk have convictions of this nature in the us many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public realm 55 as long ago as the 1960s in the us there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside 56 cities such as s o paulo have introduced an outright ban 57 with london also having specific legislation to control unlawful displays many advertisers employ a wide variety of linguistic devices to bypass regulatory laws e g in france printing english words in bold and french translations in fine print to deal with the article 120 of the 1994 toubon law limiting the use of english 58 the advertisement of controversial products such as cigarettes and condoms are subject to government regulation in many countries for instance the tobacco industry is required by law in most countries to display warnings cautioning consumers about the health hazards of their products linguistic variation is often used by advertisers as a creative device to reduce the impact of such requirements edit advertising research main article advertising research advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising it entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies advertising research includes pre testing also known as copy testing and post testing of ads and or campaigns pre testing is done before an ad airs to gauge how well it will perform and post testing is done after an ad airs to determine the in market impact of the ad or campaign on the consumer continuous ad tracking and the communicus system are competing examples of post testing advertising research types citation needed edit semiotics main article advertising research today s culture is made up of meanings between consumers and marketers these meanings depict signs and symbols that are encoded in everyday objects 59 semiotics is the study of signs and how they are interpreted advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within brand names logos package designs print advertisements and television advertisements the purpose of semiotics is to study and interpret the message being conveyed in advertisements logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels known as the surface level and the underlying level the surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for their product these signs can be images words fonts colors or slogan the underlying level is made up of hidden meanings the combination of images words colors and slogan must be interpreted by the audience or consumer 60 the key to advertising analysis is the signifier and the signified the signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept 61 a product has a signifier and a signified the signifier is the color brand name logo design and technology the signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative the denotative meaning is the meaning of the product a television s denotative meaning would be that it is high definition the connotative meaning is the product s deep and hidden meaning a connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top of the line 62 apple is an excellent example of using semiotics in their advertising campaign apple s commercials used a black silhouette of a person that was the age of apple s target market they placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing however the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white ipod through white headphones through advertising the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an ipod the white color signifies almost all of apple s products 63 the semiotics of gender plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted when considering gender roles in advertising individuals are influenced by three categories certain characteristics of stumuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message if the product is perceived as feminine or masculine second the characteristics of individuals can affect attention and elaboration of the message traditional or non traditional gender role orientation lastly situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message 64 there are two types of marketing communication claims objective and subjective 65 objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service feature for instance the camera has auto focus features subjective claims convey emotional subjective impressions of intangible aspects of a product or service they are non physical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived as they have no physical reality for instance the brochure has a beautiful design 66 males tend to respond better to objective marketing communications claims while females tend to respond better to subjective marketing communications claims 67 in advertisements men are represented as independent they are shown in more occupations than women women are represented mainly as housewives and mothers men are more likely to be shown advertising cars or business products while women advertise domestic products men are more likely to be shown outdoors or in business settings women are depicted in domestic settings men are more often portrayed as authorities as far as ads go with age men seem to gain wisdom and authority on the other hand women seem to disappear with age voiceovers are commonly used in advertising most voiceovers are men figures of up to 94 have been reported there have been more female voiceovers in recent years but mainly for food household products and feminine care products 68 edit gender effects in the processing of advertising according to a 1977 study by david statt females process information comprehensively while males process information through heuristic devices such as procedures methods or strategies for solving problems which could have an effect on how they interpret advertising 69 according to this study men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message where females engage in more creative associative imagery laced interpretation more recently research by martin 2003 reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads and the affective tone of the advertising when feeling sad males prefer happy ads to boost their mood in contrast females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy the television programs in which the ads are embedded are shown to influence a consumer s mood state 70 edit see also business and economics portal ad server advertising to children bibliography of
