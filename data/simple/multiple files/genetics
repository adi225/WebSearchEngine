genetics from ancient greek genetikos genitive and that from genesis origin 1 2 3 a discipline of biology is the science of genes heredity and variation in living organisms 4 5 genetics deals with the molecular structure and function of genes gene behavior in context of a cell or organism e g dominance and epigenetics patterns of inheritance from parent to offspring and gene distribution variation and change in populations such as through genome wide association studies given that genes are universal to living organisms genetics can be applied to the study of all living systems from viruses and bacteria through plants and domestic animals to humans as in medical genetics the fact that living things inherit traits from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding however the modern science of genetics which attempts to understand the process of inheritance only began with the work of gregor mendel in the mid 19th century 6 although he did not know the physical basis for heredity mendel observed that organisms inherit traits by way of discrete units of inheritance which are now called genes genes correspond to regions within dna a molecule composed of a chain of four different types of nucleotides the sequence of these nucleotides is the genetic information organisms inherit dna naturally occurs in a double stranded form with nucleotides on each strand complementary to each other each strand can act as a template for creating a new partner strand this is the physical method for making copies of genes that can be inherited the sequence of nucleotides in a gene is translated by cells to produce a chain of amino acids creating proteins the order of amino acids in a protein corresponds to the order of nucleotides in the gene this relationship between nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence is known as the genetic code the amino acids in a protein determine how it folds into a three dimensional shape this structure is in turn responsible for the protein s function proteins carry out almost all the functions needed for cells to live a change to the dna in a gene can change a protein s amino acids changing its shape and function this can have a dramatic effect in the cell and on the organism as a whole although genetics plays a large role in the appearance and behavior of organisms it is the combination of genetics with what an organism experiences that determines the ultimate outcome for example while genes play a role in determining an organism s size the nutrition and health it experiences after inception also have a large effect contents 1 history 1 1 mendelian and classical genetics 1 2 molecular genetics 2 features of inheritance 2 1 discrete inheritance and mendel s laws

nucleotides matching each other in the center to form what look like rungs on a twisted ladder although the science of genetics began with the applied and theoretical work of gregor mendel in the mid 19th century other theories of inheritance preceded mendel a popular theory during mendel s time was the concept of blending inheritance the idea that individuals inherit a smooth blend of traits from their parents mendel s work provided examples where traits were definitely not blended after hybridization showing that traits are produced by combinations of distinct genes rather than a continuous blend blending of traits in the progeny is now explained by the action of multiple genes with quantitative effects another theory that had some support at that time was the inheritance of acquired characteristics the belief that individuals inherit traits strengthened by their parents this theory commonly associated with jean baptiste lamarck is now known to be wrong the experiences of individuals do not affect the genes they pass to their children 7 other theories included the pangenesis of charles darwin which had both acquired and inherited aspects and francis galton s reformulation of pangenesis as both particulate and inherited 8 edit mendelian and classical genetics modern genetics started with gregor johann mendel a german czech augustinian monk and scientist who studied the nature of inheritance in plants in his paper versuche ber pflanzenhybriden experiments on plant hybridization presented in 1865 to the naturforschender verein society for research in nature in br nn mendel traced the inheritance patterns of certain traits in pea plants and described them mathematically 9 although this pattern of inheritance could only be observed for a few traits mendel s work suggested that heredity was particulate not acquired and that the inheritance patterns of many traits could be explained through simple rules and ratios the importance of mendel s work did not gain wide understanding until the 1890s after his death when other scientists working on similar problems re discovered his research william bateson a proponent of mendel s work coined the word genetics in 1905 10 11 the adjective genetic derived from the greek word genesis origin predates the noun and was first used in a biological sense in 1860 12 bateson popularized the usage of the word genetics to describe the study of inheritance in his inaugural address to the third international conference on plant hybridization in london england in 1906 13 after the rediscovery of mendel s work scientists tried to determine which molecules in the cell were responsible for inheritance in 1911 thomas hunt morgan argued that genes are on chromosomes based on observations of a sex linked white eye mutation in fruit flies 14 in 1913 his student alfred sturtevant used the phenomenon of genetic linkage to show that genes are arranged linearly on the chromosome 15 morgan s observation of sex linked inheritance of a mutation causing white eyes in drosophila led him to the hypothesis that genes are located upon chromosomes edit molecular genetics although genes were known to exist on chromosomes chromosomes are composed of both protein and dna and scientists did not know which of these is responsible for inheritance in 1928 frederick griffith discovered the phenomenon of transformation see griffith s experiment dead bacteria could transfer genetic material to transform other still living bacteria sixteen years later in 1944 oswald theodore avery colin mcleod and maclyn mccarty identified the molecule responsible for transformation as dna 16 the role of the nucleus as the respository of genetic information in eukaryotes had been established by h mmerling in 1943 in his work on the single celled alga acetabularia 17 the hershey chase experiment in 1952 confirmed that dna rather than protein is the genetic material of the viruses that infect bacteria providing further evidence that dna is the molecule responsible for inheritance 18 james d watson and francis crick determined the structure of dna in 1953 using the x ray crystallography work of rosalind franklin and maurice wilkins that indicated dna had a helical structure i e shaped like a corkscrew 19 20 their double helix model had two strands of dna with the nucleotides pointing inward each matching a complementary nucleotide on the other strand to form what looks like rungs on a twisted ladder 21 this structure showed that genetic information exists in the sequence of nucleotides on each strand of dna the structure also suggested a simple method for duplication if the strands are separated new partner strands can be reconstructed for each based on the sequence of the old strand although the structure of dna showed how inheritance works it was still not known how dna influences the behavior of cells in the following years scientists tried to understand how dna controls the process of protein production it was discovered that the cell uses dna as a template to create matching messenger rna a molecule with nucleotides very similar to dna the nucleotide sequence of a messenger rna is used to create an amino acid sequence in protein this translation between nucleotide and amino acid sequences is known as the genetic code with this molecular understanding of inheritance an explosion of research became possible one important development was chain termination dna sequencing in 1977 by frederick sanger this technology allows scientists to read the nucleotide sequence of a dna molecule 22 in 1983 kary banks mullis developed the polymerase chain reaction providing a quick way to isolate and amplify a specific section of a dna from a mixture 23 through the pooled efforts of the human genome project and the parallel private effort by celera genomics these and other methods culminated in the sequencing of the human genome in 2003 24 edit features of inheritance edit discrete inheritance and mendel s laws main article mendelian inheritance a punnett square depicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for purple b and white b blossoms at its most fundamental level inheritance in organisms occurs by means of discrete traits called genes 25 this property was first observed by gregor mendel who studied the segregation of heritable traits in pea plants 9 26 in his experiments studying the trait for flower color mendel observed that the flowers of each pea plant were either purple or white but never an intermediate between the two colors these different discrete versions of the same gene are called alleles in the case of pea which is a diploid species each individual plant has two copies of each gene one copy inherited from each parent 27 many species including humans have this pattern of inheritance diploid organisms with two copies of the same allele of a given gene are called homozygous at that gene locus while organisms with two different alleles of a given gene are called heterozygous the set of alleles for a given organism is called its genotype while the observable traits of the organism are called its phenotype when organisms are heterozygous at a gene often one allele is called dominant as its qualities dominate the phenotype of the organism while the other allele is called recessive as its qualities recede and are not observed some alleles do not have complete dominance and instead have incomplete dominance by expressing an intermediate phenotype or codominance by expressing both alleles at once 28 when a pair of organisms reproduce sexually their offspring randomly inherit one of the two alleles from each parent these observations of discrete inheritance and the segregation of alleles are collectively known as mendel s first law or the law of segregation edit notation and diagrams genetic pedigree charts help track the inheritance patterns of traits geneticists use diagrams and symbols to describe inheritance a gene is represented by one or a few letters often a symbol is used to mark the usual non mutant allele for a gene 29 in fertilization and breeding experiments and especially when discussing mendel s laws the parents are referred to as the p generation and the offspring as the f1 first filial generation when the f1 offspring mate with each other the offspring are called the f2 second filial generation one of the common diagrams used to predict the result of cross breeding is the punnett square when studying human genetic diseases geneticists often use pedigree charts to represent the inheritance of traits 30 these charts map the inheritance of a trait in a family tree edit interactions of multiple genes human height is a trait with complex genetic causes francis galton s data from 1889 shows the relationship between offspring height as a function of mean parent height while correlated remaining variation in offspring heights indicates environment is also an important factor in this trait organisms have thousands of genes and in sexually reproducing organisms these genes generally assort independently of each other this means that the inheritance of an allele for yellow or green pea color is unrelated to the inheritance of alleles for white or purple flowers this phenomenon known as mendel s second law or the law of independent assortment means that the alleles of different genes get shuffled between parents to form offspring with many different combinations some genes do not assort independently demonstrating genetic linkage a topic discussed later in this article often different genes can interact in a way that influences the same trait in the blue eyed mary omphalodes verna for example there exists a gene with alleles that determine the color of flowers blue or magenta another gene however controls whether the flowers have color at all or are white when a plant has two copies of this white allele its flowers are white regardless of whether the first gene has blue or magenta alleles this interaction between genes is called epistasis with the second gene epistatic to the first 31 many traits are not discrete features e g purple or white flowers but are instead continuous features e g human height and skin color these complex traits are products of many genes 32 the influence of these genes is mediated to varying degrees by the environment an organism has experienced the degree to which an organism s genes contribute to a complex trait is called heritability 33 measurement of the heritability of a trait is relative in a more variable environment the environment has a bigger influence on the total variation of the trait for example human height is a trait with complex causes it has a heritability of 89 in the united states in nigeria however where people experience a more variable access to good nutrition and health care height has a heritability of only 62 34 edit molecular basis for inheritance edit dna and chromosomes main articles dna and chromosome the molecular structure of dna bases pair through the arrangement of hydrogen bonding between the strands the molecular basis for genes is deoxyribonucleic acid dna dna is composed of a chain of nucleotides of which there are four types adenine a cytosine c guanine g and thymine t genetic information exists in the sequence of these nucleotides and genes exist as stretches of sequence along the dna chain 35 viruses are the only exception to this rule sometimes viruses use the very similar molecule rna instead of dna as their genetic material 36 dna normally exists as a double stranded molecule coiled into the shape of a double helix each nucleotide in dna preferentially pairs with its partner nucleotide on the opposite strand a pairs with t and c pairs with g thus in its two stranded form each strand effectively contains all necessary information redundant with its partner strand this structure of dna is the physical basis for inheritance dna replication duplicates the genetic information by splitting the strands and using each strand as a template for synthesis of a new partner strand 37 genes are arranged linearly along long chains of dna base pair sequences in bacteria each cell usually contains a single circular genophore while eukaryotic organisms including plants and animals have their dna arranged in multiple linear chromosomes these dna strands are often extremely long the largest human chromosome for example is about 247 million base pairs in length 38 the dna of a chromosome is associated with structural proteins that organize compact and control access to the dna forming a material called chromatin in eukaryotes chromatin is usually composed of nucleosomes segments of dna wound around cores of histone proteins 39 the full set of hereditary material in an organism usually the combined dna sequences of all chromosomes is called the genome while haploid organisms have only one copy of each chromosome most animals and many plants are diploid containing two of each chromosome and thus two copies of every gene 27 the two alleles for a gene are located on identical loci of the two homologous chromosomes each allele inherited from a different parent walther flemming s 1882 diagram of eukaryotic cell division chromosomes are copied condensed and organized then as the cell divides chromosome copies separate into the daughter cells many species have so called sex chromosomes they are special in that they determine the sex of the organism 40 in humans and many other animals the y chromosome contains the gene that triggers the development of the specifically male characteristics in evolution this chromosome has lost most of its content and also most of its genes while the x chromosome is similar to the other chromosomes and contains many genes the x and y chromosomes form a very heterogeneous pair edit reproduction main articles asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction when cells divide their full genome is copied and each daughter cell inherits one copy this process called mitosis is the simplest form of reproduction and is the basis for asexual reproduction asexual reproduction can also occur in multicellular organisms producing offspring that inherit their genome from a single parent offspring that are genetically identical to their parents are called clones eukaryotic organisms often use sexual reproduction to generate offspring that contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents the process of sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single copies of the genome haploid and double copies diploid 27 haploid cells fuse and combine genetic material to create a diploid cell with paired chromosomes diploid organisms form haploids by dividing without replicating their dna to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their lifespan with the haploid form reduced to single cell gametes such as sperm or eggs although they do not use the haploid diploid method of sexual reproduction bacteria have many methods of acquiring new genetic information some bacteria can undergo conjugation transferring a small circular piece of dna to another bacterium 41 bacteria can also take up raw dna fragments found in the environment and integrate them into their genomes a phenomenon known as transformation 42 these processes result in horizontal gene transfer transmitting fragments of genetic information between organisms that would be otherwise unrelated edit recombination and linkage main articles chromosomal crossover and genetic linkage thomas hunt morgan s 1916 illustration of a double crossover between chromosomes the diploid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to assort independently during sexual reproduction recombining to form new combinations of genes genes on the same chromosome would theoretically never recombine however were it not for the process of chromosomal crossover during crossover chromosomes exchange stretches of dna effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes 43 this process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells the probability of chromosomal crossover occurring between two given points on the chromosome is related to the distance between the points for an arbitrarily long distance the probability of crossover is high enough that the inheritance of the genes is effectively uncorrelated for genes that are closer together however the lower probability of crossover means that the genes demonstrate genetic linkage alleles for the two genes tend to be inherited together the amounts of linkage between a series of genes can be combined to form a linear linkage map that roughly describes the arrangement of the genes along the chromosome 44 edit gene expression edit genetic code main article genetic code the genetic code dna through a messenger rna intermediate codes for protein with a triplet code genes generally express their functional effect through the production of proteins which are complex molecules responsible for most functions in the cell proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains each of which is composed of a sequence of amino acids and the dna sequence of a gene through an rna intermediate is used to produce a specific amino acid sequence this process begins with the production of an rna molecule with a sequence matching the gene s dna sequence a process called transcription this messenger rna molecule is then used to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called translation each group of three nucleotides in the sequence called a codon corresponds either to one of the twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction to end the amino acid sequence this correspondence is called the genetic code 45 the flow of information is unidirectional information is transferred from nucleotide sequences into the amino acid sequence of proteins but it never transfers from protein back into the sequence of dna a phenomenon francis crick called the central dogma of molecular biology 46 a single amino acid change causes hemoglobin to form fibers the specific sequence of amino acids results in a unique three dimensional structure for that protein and the three dimensional structures of proteins are related to their functions 47 48 some are simple structural molecules like the fibers formed by the protein collagen proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within the bound molecules without changing the structure of the protein itself protein structure is dynamic the protein hemoglobin bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture transport and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood a single nucleotide difference within dna can cause a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein because protein structures are the result of their amino acid sequences some changes can dramatically change the properties of a protein by destabilizing the structure or changing the surface of the protein in a way that changes its interaction with other proteins and molecules for example sickle cell anemia is a human genetic disease that results from a single base difference within the coding region for the globin section of hemoglobin causing a single amino acid change that changes hemoglobin s physical properties 49 sickle cell versions of hemoglobin stick to themselves stacking to form fibers that distort the shape of red blood cells carrying the protein these sickle shaped cells no longer flow smoothly through blood vessels having a tendency to clog or degrade causing the medical problems associated with this disease some genes are transcribed into rna but are not translated into protein products such rna molecules are called non coding rna in some cases these products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions e g ribosomal rna and transfer rna rna can also have regulatory effect through hybridization interactions with other rna molecules e g microrna edit nature versus nurture main article nature vs nurture siamese cats have a temperature sensitive mutation in pigment production although genes contain all the information an organism uses to function the environment plays an important role in determining the ultimate phenotype a phenomenon often referred to as nature vs nurture the phenotype of an organism depends on the interaction of genetics with the environment one example of this is the case of temperature sensitive mutations often a single amino acid change within the sequence of a protein does not change its behavior and interactions with other molecules but it does destabilize the structure in a high temperature environment where molecules are moving more quickly and hitting each other this results in the protein losing its structure and failing to function in a low temperature environment however the protein s structure is stable and it functions normally this type of mutation is visible in the coat coloration of siamese cats where a mutation in an enzyme responsible for pigment production causes it to destabilize and lose function at high temperatures 50 the protein remains functional in areas of skin that are colder legs ears tail and face and so the cat has dark fur at its extremities environment also plays a dramatic role in effects of the human genetic disease phenylketonuria 51 the mutation that causes phenylketonuria disrupts the ability of the body to break down the amino acid phenylalanine causing a toxic build up of an intermediate molecule that in turn causes severe symptoms of progressive mental retardation and seizures if someone with the phenylketonuria mutation follows a strict diet that avoids this amino acid however they remain normal and healthy a popular method to determine how much role nature and nurture play is to study identical and fraternal twins or siblings of multiple birth 52 because identical siblings come from the same zygote they are genetically the same fraternal siblings however are as different genetically from one another as normal siblings by comparing how often the twin of a set has the same disorder between fraternal and identical twins scientists can see whether there is more of a nature or nurture effect one famous example of a multiple birth study includes the genain quadruplets who were identical quadruplets all diagnosed with schizophrenia 53 edit gene regulation main article regulation of gene expression the genome of a given organism contains thousands of genes but not all these genes need to be active at any given moment a gene is expressed when it is being transcribed into mrna and translated into protein and there exist many cellular methods of controlling the expression of genes such that proteins are produced only when needed by the cell transcription factors are regulatory proteins that bind to the start of genes either promoting or inhibiting the transcription of the gene 54 within the genome of escherichia coli bacteria for example there exists a series of genes necessary for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan however when tryptophan is already available to the cell these genes for tryptophan synthesis are no longer needed the presence of tryptophan directly affects the activity of the genes tryptophan molecules bind to the tryptophan repressor a transcription factor changing the repressor s structure such that the repressor binds to the genes the tryptophan repressor blocks the transcription and expression of the genes thereby creating negative feedback regulation of the tryptophan synthesis process 55 transcription factors bind to dna influencing the transcription of associated genes differences in gene expression are especially clear within multicellular organisms where cells all contain the same genome but have very different structures and behaviors due to the expression of different sets of genes all the cells in a multicellular organism derive from a single cell differentiating into variant cell types in response to external and intercellular signals and gradually establishing different patterns of gene expression to create different behaviors as no single gene is responsible for the development of structures within multicellular organisms these patterns arise from the complex interactions between many cells within eukaryotes there exist structural features of chromatin that influence the transcription of genes often in the form of modifications to dna and chromatin that are stably inherited by daughter cells 56 these features are called epigenetic because they exist on top of the dna sequence and retain inheritance from one cell generation to the next because of epigenetic features different cell types grown within the same medium can retain very different properties although epigenetic features are generally dynamic over the course of development some like the phenomenon of paramutation have multigenerational inheritance and exist as rare exceptions to the general rule of dna as the basis for inheritance 57 edit genetic change edit mutations main article mutation gene duplication allows diversification by providing redundancy one gene can mutate and lose its original function without harming the organism during the process of dna replication errors occasionally occur in the polymerization of the second strand these errors called mutations can have an impact on the phenotype of an organism especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene error rates are usually very low 1 error in every 10 100 160 million bases due to the proofreading ability of dna polymerases 58 59 without proofreading error rates are a thousandfold higher because many viruses rely on dna and rna polymerases that lack proofreading ability they experience higher mutation rates processes that increase the rate of changes in dna are called mutagenic mutagenic chemicals promote errors in dna replication often by interfering with the structure of base pairing while uv radiation induces mutations by causing damage to the dna structure 60 chemical damage to dna occurs naturally as well and cells use dna repair mechanisms to repair mismatches and breaks in dna nevertheless the repair sometimes fails to return the dna to its original sequence in organisms that use chromosomal crossover to exchange dna and recombine genes errors in alignment during meiosis can also cause mutations 61 errors in crossover are especially likely when similar sequences cause partner chromosomes to adopt a mistaken alignment this makes some regions in genomes more prone to mutating in this way these errors create large structural changes in dna sequence duplications inversions or deletions of entire regions or the accidental exchanging of whole parts between different chromosomes called translocation edit natural selection and evolution main article evolution further information natural selection mutations alter an organisms genotype and occasionally this causes different phenotypes to appear most mutations have little effect on an organism s phenotype health or reproductive fitness mutations that do have an effect are usually deleterious but occasionally some can be beneficial studies in the fly drosophila melanogaster suggest that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene about 70 percent of these mutations will be harmful with the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial 62 an evolutionary tree of eukaryotic organisms constructed by comparison of several orthologous gene sequences population genetics studies the distribution of genetic differences within populations and how these distributions change over time 63 changes in the frequency of an allele in a population are mainly influenced by natural selection where a given allele provides a selective or reproductive advantage to the organism 64 as well as other factors such as mutation genetic drift genetic draft 65 artificial selection and migration 66 over many generations the genomes of organisms can change significantly resulting in the phenomenon of evolution selection for beneficial mutations can cause a species to evolve into forms better able to survive in their environment a process called adaptation 67 new species are formed through the process of speciation often caused by geographical separations that prevent populations from exchanging genes with each other 68 the application of genetic principles to the study of population biology and evolution is referred to as the modern synthesis by comparing the homology between different species genomes it is possible to calculate the evolutionary distance between them and when they may have diverged called a molecular clock genetic comparisons are generally considered a more accurate method of characterizing the relatedness between species than the comparison of phenotypic characteristics the evolutionary distances between species can be used to form evolutionary trees these trees represent the common descent and divergence of species over time although they do not show the transfer of genetic material between unrelated species known as horizontal gene transfer and most common in bacteria 69 edit research and technology edit model organisms the common fruit fly drosophila melanogaster is a popular model organism in genetics research although geneticists originally studied inheritance in a wide range of organisms researchers began to specialize in studying the genetics of a particular subset of organisms the fact that significant research already existed for a given organism would encourage new researchers to choose it for further study and so eventually a few model organisms became the basis for most genetics research 70 common research topics in model organism genetics include the study of gene regulation and the involvement of genes in development and cancer organisms were chosen in part for convenience short generation times and easy genetic manipulation made some organisms popular genetics research tools widely used model organisms include the gut bacterium escherichia coli the plant arabidopsis thaliana baker s yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the nematode caenorhabditis elegans the common fruit fly drosophila melanogaster and the common house mouse mus musculus edit medicine medical genetics seeks to understand how genetic variation relates to human health and disease 71 when searching for an unknown gene that may be involved in a disease researchers commonly use genetic linkage and genetic pedigree charts to find the location on the genome associated with the disease at the population level researchers take advantage of mendelian randomization to look for locations in the genome that are associated with diseases a method especially useful for multigenic traits not clearly defined by a single gene 72 once a candidate gene is found further research is often done on the corresponding gene called an orthologous gene in model organisms in addition to studying genetic diseases the increased availability of genotyping methods has led to the field of pharmacogenetics studying how genotype can affect drug responses 73 individuals differ in their inherited tendency to develop cancer 74 and cancer is a genetic disease 75 the process of cancer development in the body is a combination of events mutations occasionally occur within cells in the body as they divide although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring they can affect the behavior of cells sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently there are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger cell death but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages an internal process of natural selection occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth creating a cancerous tumor that grows and invades various tissues of the body normally a cell divides only in response to signals growth factors it stops growing when making contact with surrounding cells contact inhibition and in response to growth inhibitory signals it divides a limited number of times and dies apoptosis it stays inside the epithelium and is not able to migrate to invade other organs to become a cancer cell a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes 3 7 that allow it to bypass all these regulations it no longer needs growth factors to divide it continues growing when making contact to neighbor cells and ignores inhibitory signals it will keep growing indefinitely and is immortal it will escape from the epithelium and ultimately may be able to escape from the primary tumor cross the endothelium of a blood vessel be transported by the bloodstream and will colonize a new organ forming deadly metastasis although there are some genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers the major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not transmitted to the progeny somatic mutations the most frequent mutations are a loss of function of p53 protein a tumor suppressor or in the p53 pathway and gain of function mutations in the ras proteins or in other oncogenes edit research methods dna can be manipulated in the laboratory restriction enzymes are commonly used enzymes that cut dna at specific sequences producing predictable fragments of dna 76 dna fragments can be visualized through use of gel electrophoresis which separates fragments according to their length the use of ligation enzymes allows dna fragments to be connected and by ligating fragments of dna together from different sources researchers can create recombinant dna often associated with genetically modified organisms recombinant dna is commonly used in the context of plasmids short circular dna fragments with a few genes on them by inserting plasmids into bacteria and growing those bacteria on plates of agar to isolate clones of bacteria cells researchers can clonally amplify the inserted fragment of dna a process known as molecular cloning cloning can also refer to creating clonal organisms by various means colonies of e coli on a plate of agar an example of cellular cloning and often used in molecular cloning dna can also be amplified using a procedure called the polymerase chain reaction pcr 77 by using specific short sequences of dna pcr can isolate and exponentially amplify a targeted region of dna because it can amplify from extremely small amounts of dna pcr is also often used to detect the presence of specific dna sequences edit dna sequencing and genomics one of the most fundamental technologies developed to study genetics dna sequencing allows researchers to determine the sequence of nucleotides in dna fragments developed in 1977 by frederick sanger and coworkers chain termination sequencing is now routinely used to sequence dna fragments 78 with this technology researchers have been able to study the molecular sequences associated with many human diseases as sequencing has become less expensive researchers have sequenced the genomes of many organisms using computational tools to stitch together the sequences of many different fragments a process called genome assembly 79 these technologies were used to sequence the human genome leading to the completion of the human genome project in 2003 24 new high throughput sequencing technologies are dramatically lowering the cost of dna sequencing with many researchers hoping to bring the cost of resequencing a human genome down to a thousand dollars 80 the large amount of sequence data available has created the field of genomics research that uses computational tools to search for and analyze patterns in the full genomes of organisms genomics can also be considered a subfield of bioinformatics which uses computational approaches to analyze
