data mining in agriculture is a very recent research topic it consists in the application of data mining techniques to agriculture recent technologies are nowadays able to provide a lot of information on agricultural related activities which can then be analyzed in order to find important information 1 a related but not equivalent term is precision agriculture contents 1 applications 1 1 prediction of problematic wine fermentations 1 2 detection of diseases from sounds issued by animals 1 3 sorting apples by watercores 1 4 optimizing pesticide usage by data mining 1 5 explaining pesticide abuse by data mining 2 literature 3 conferences 4 references edit applications edit prediction of problematic wine fermentations wine is widely produced all around the world the fermentation process of the wine is very important because it can impact the productivity of wine related industries and also the quality of wine if we were able to predict how the fermentation is going to be at the early stages of the process we could interfere with the process in order to guarantee a regular and smooth fermentation fermentations are nowadays studied by using different techniques such as for example the k means algorithm 2 and a technique for classification based on the concept of biclustering 3 note that these works are different from the ones where a classification of different kinds of wine is performed see the wiki page classification of wine for more details edit detection of diseases from sounds issued by animals the detection of animal s diseases in farms can impact positively the productivity of the farm because sick animals can cause contaminations moreover the early detection of the diseases can allow the farmer to cure the animal as soon as the disease appears sounds issued by pigs can be analyzed for the detection of diseases in particular their coughs can be studied because they indicate their sickness a computational system is under development which is able to monitor pig sounds by microphones installed in the farm and which is also able to discriminate among the different sounds that can be detected 4 edit sorting apples by watercores before going to market apples are checked and the ones showing some defects are removed however there are also invisible defects that can spoil the apple flavor and look an example of invisible defect is the watercore this is an internal apple disorder that can affect the longevity of the fruit apples with slight or mild watercores are sweeter but apples with moderate to sever degree of watercore cannot be stored for any length of time moreover a few fruits with severe watercore could spoil a whole batch of apples for this reason a computational system is under study which takes x ray photographs of the fruit while they run on conveyor belts and which is also able to analyse by data mining techniques the taken pictures and estimate the probability that the fruit contains watercores 5 edit optimizing pesticide usage by data mining recent studies by agriculture researchers in pakistan one of the top four cotton producers of the world showed that attempts of cotton crop yield maximization through pro pesticide state policies have led to a dangerously high pesticide usage these studies have reported a negative correlation between pesticide usage and crop yield in pakistan hence excessive use or abuse of pesticides is harming the farmers with adverse financial environmental and social impacts by data mining the cotton pest scouting data along with the meteorological recordings it was shown that how pesticide usage can be optimized reduced clustering of data revealed interesting patterns of farmer practices along with pesticide usage dynamics and hence help identify the reasons for this pesticide abuse 6 edit explaining pesticide abuse by data mining to monitor cotton growth different government departments and agencies in pakistan have been recording pest scouting agriculture and metrological data for decades coarse estimates of just the cotton pest scouting data recorded stands at around 1 5 million records and growing the primary agro met data recorded has never been digitized integrated or standardized to give a complete picture and hence cannot support decision making thus requiring an agriculture data warehouse creating a novel pilot agriculture extension data warehouse followed by analysis through querying and data mining some interesting discoveries were made such as pesticides sprayed at the wrong time wrong pesticides used for the right reasons and temporal relationship between pesticide usage and day of the week 7 edit literature since this research topic is quite recent there is only one reference book data mining in agriculture is published by springer and it is co authored by antonio mucherino petraq papajorgji and panos pardalos a quick survey of the book can be found at this address there are a few precision agriculture journals such as springer s precision agriculture or elsevier s computers and electronics in agriculture but those are not exclusively devoted to data mining in agriculture edit conferences there are many conferences organized every year on data mining techniques and applications but rather few of them consider problems arising in the agricultural field to date there is only one example of conference completely devoted to applications in agriculture of data mining it is organized by georg ru this is the conference web page edit references mucherino a papajorgji p j
