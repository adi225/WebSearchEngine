possibility of a wiki based internet search 5 the result was extensive media coverage in multiple languages in outlets like the guardian the sydney morning herald and online editions of forbes and business week publishing the statement as an announcement encouraging the company to re brand and relaunch its previous search engine proposal under the temporary name of search wikia 6 in a later interview wales attempted to clarify several issues he said that funding received from amazon com was not specific to the search project and also restated that wikia and wikipedia have separate management even though they shared three key stakeholders when asked whether the project was formally announced he said it was partly planned and partly a response to news coverage 7 on january 31 2007 at a talk given at new york university wales announced that wikia plans to build a search engine rivaling those of google and yahoo based on the kind of collaborative cooperation which has been so successful in developing wikipedia arguing that search should be open transparent participatory and democratic 8 he later suggested this new approach could account for five percent of the search market 9 on march 10 2007 gil penchina chief executive officer of wikia stated in an interview that the goal for the project is to get five percent of the search market and that a release date for services was not scheduled we re really trying to build a movement to make search free and open and transparent penchina said we have some servers up and people are hacking away the free and open source approach of utilizing programmers and users around the world is different from that used by major search providers such as google and yahoo who keep most of their code secret and could provide a search engine that lets users edit and fine tune its results 10 on december 24 2007 wales announced that wikia search had entered private pre alpha 11 12 in august 2008 wikia search launched an official version of the wikia toolbar that can be downloaded and added on to the firefox browser in october 2008 wise wikia intelligent search extensions 13 was released in march 2009 the project ended wikia search was not making its numbers with only 10 000 unique users a month over the past six months wales said it was hard to justify the resources being put into it 14 on june 3 2008 an upgraded version of wikia search was released with additional features such as improved screen display and facilities for users to rate edit and enhance the search results in particular it offered users the possibility of adding pertinent urls to the results displayed and deleting any misleading results with immediate effect 15 the improvements were widely welcomed by a number of former critics 16 by august 2008 wikia search held a 0 000079 share of the search market in the u s compared with google s 70 77 17 while google was conducting experiments with page ranking based on user feedback around this time jimmy wales stated that google s random tests and its closed algorithm were different from the open community oriented crowdsourcing attempts of wikia search 18 the site was said to be going down after march 31 2009 19 however as of april 16 2009 the site was running but with so long and thanks for all the fish have a specific question try wikianswers near the bottom of the page finally on may 14 2009 the search engine service was brought to a halt queries to the wikia search website were redirected with a message in part stating the wikia search project has ended edit search engine edit features the search engine s result pages provided access to three major components a web search engine a social network service and a wiki which hosts so called mini articles edit mini articles a prominent feature of the search engine were the human written mini articles mini articles were short articles about the topics given by their title they were hosted by a wikia wiki whenever a search query is issued with mini in front the results page looked in the wiki for a mini article with a name that matched the search query if no matching article existed the search user was given the opportunity to write a new one edit social network the user interface was tied in with a social network application called foowi 20 users could create an account for the application and fill in a profile the system linked the wiki login to the social network login profile functions include status basic profile white board albums friends personal and work edit web search engine the web search engine consisted of the following components crawler s grub indices the search engine proper three selectable indices by default an index that uses nutch and browser based results presentation written in javascript the results presentation used xml formatted requests to query the index the xml format is called open index 21 and can be used to query indices other than the one at internet systems consortium isc the results presentation once included an option to select a different index to be used out of three in early 2009 yahoo boss was being used as the back end 22 edit organization the servers that implement the web search engine s default index 23 are owned and operated by the isc 24 although the index servers were donated to isc the index server s domain name still remains the one of the wikia search software labs 25 26 the search engine s main page 27 and result pages 28 themselves are served by wikia note that the result pages content is retrieved from the index server at swlabs org not from wikia com the social network like the results presentation was hosted by wikia search wikia 29 the wiki which hosted the mini articles is hosted by wikia the wiki s content is licensed under the gnu free documentation license gfdl 30 although formally owned by wikia wikia s management have stated that they want the wiki s user community to govern the wiki 31 as is custom
