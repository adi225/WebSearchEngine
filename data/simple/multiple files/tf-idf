tf idf term frequency inverse document frequency is a numerical statistic which reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus it is often used as a weighting factor in information retrieval and text mining the tf idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus which helps to control for the fact that some words are generally more common than others variations of the tf idf weighting scheme are often used by search engines as a central tool in scoring and ranking a document s relevance given a user query tf idf can be successfully used for stop words filtering in various subject fields including text summarization and classification 1 one of the simplest ranking functions is computed by summing the tf idf for each query term many more sophisticated ranking functions are variants of this simple model contents 1 motivation 2 mathematical details 3 see also 4 references 5 external links edit motivation suppose we have a set of english text documents and wish to determine which document is most relevant to the query the brown cow a simple way to start out is by eliminating documents that do not contain all three words the brown and cow but this still leaves many documents to further distinguish them we might count the number of times each term occurs in each document and sum them all together the number of times a term occurs in a document is called its term frequency however because the term the is so common this will tend to incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word the more frequently without giving enough weight to the more meaningful terms brown and cow the term the is not a good keyword to distinguish relevant and non relevant documents and terms unlike the less common words brown and cow hence an inverse document frequency factor is incorporated which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the collection and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely edit mathematical details tf idf is the product of two statistics term frequency and inverse document frequency various ways for determining the exact values of both statistics exist in the case of the term frequency tf t d the simplest choice is to simply use the raw frequency of a term in a document i e the number of times that term t occurs in document d if we denote the raw frequency of t by f t d then the simple tf scheme is tf t d f t d other possibilities include 2 boolean frequencies tf t d 1 if t occurs in d and 0 otherwise logarithmically scaled frequency tf t d 1 log f t d and 0 when f t d 0 normalized frequency to prevent a bias towards longer documents e g raw frequency divided by the maximum raw frequency of any term in the document the inverse document frequency is a measure of whether the term is common or rare across all documents it is obtained by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents containing the term and then taking the logarithm of that quotient with cardinality of d or the total number of documents in the corpus 160 number of documents where the term appears i e if the term is not in the corpus this will lead to a division by zero it is therefore common to adjust the formula to mathematically the base of the log function does not matter and constitutes a constant multiplicative factor towards the overall result then tf idf is calculated as a high weight in tf idf is reached by a high term frequency in the given document and a low document frequency of the term in the whole collection of documents the weights hence tend to filter out common terms since the ratio inside the idf s log function is always greater than or equal to 1 the value of idf and tf idf is greater than or equal to 0 as a term appears in more documents the ratio inside the logarithm approaches 1 bringing the idf and tf idf closer to 0 various mathematical forms of the tf idf term weight can be derived from a probabilistic retrieval model that mimicks human relevance decision making edit see also okapi bm25 noun phrase word count vector
