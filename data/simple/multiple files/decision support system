example of a decision support system for john day reservoir a decision support system dss is a computer based information system that supports business or organizational decision making activities dsss serve the management operations and planning levels of an organization and help to make decisions which may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advance decision support systems can be either fully computerized human or a combination of both dsss include knowledge based systems a properly designed dss is an interactive software based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data documents and personal knowledge or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions typical information that a decision support application might gather and present includes inventories of information assets including legacy and relational data sources cubes data warehouses and data marts comparative sales figures between one period and the next projected revenue figures based on product sales assumptions contents 1 history 2 taxonomies 3 components 3 1 development frameworks 4 classification 5 applications 6 benefits 7

decision making done at the carnegie institute of technology during the late 1950s and early 1960s and the technical work on technology in the 1960s it is considered that the concept of dss became an area of research of its own in the middle of the 1970s before gaining in intensity during the 1980s in the middle and late 1980s executive information systems eis group decision support systems gdss and organizational decision support systems odss evolved from the single user and model oriented dss according to sol 1987 2 the definition and scope of dss has been migrating over the years in the 1970s dss was described as a computer based system to aid decision making in the late 1970s the dss movement started focusing on interactive computer based systems which help decision makers utilize data bases and models to solve ill structured problems in the 1980s dss should provide systems using suitable and available technology to improve effectiveness of managerial and professional activities and end 1980s dss faced a new challenge towards the design of intelligent workstations 2 in 1987 texas instruments completed development of the gate assignment display system gads for united airlines this decision support system is credited with significantly reducing travel delays by aiding the management of ground operations at various airports beginning with o hare international airport in chicago and stapleton airport in denver colorado 3 4 beginning in about 1990 data warehousing and on line analytical processing olap began broadening the realm of dss as the turn of the millennium approached new web based analytical applications were introduced the advent of better and better reporting technologies has seen dss start to emerge as a critical component of management design examples of this can be seen in the intense amount of discussion of dss in the education environment dss also have a weak connection to the user interface paradigm of hypertext both the university of vermont promis system for medical decision making and the carnegie mellon zog kms system for military and business decision making were decision support systems which also were major breakthroughs in user interface research furthermore although hypertext researchers have generally been concerned with information overload certain researchers notably douglas engelbart have been focused on decision makers in particular decision generate by chronical format so it is important edit taxonomies as with the definition there is no universally accepted taxonomy of dss either different authors propose different classifications using the relationship with the user as the criterion haettenschwiler 5 differentiates passive active and cooperative dss a passive dss is a system that aids the process of decision making but that cannot bring out explicit decision suggestions or solutions an active dss can bring out such decision suggestions or solutions a cooperative dss allows the decision maker or its advisor to modify complete or refine the decision suggestions provided by the system before sending them back to the system for validation the system again improves completes and refines the suggestions of the decision maker and sends them back to him for validation the whole process then starts again until a consolidated solution is generated another taxonomy for dss has been created by daniel power using the mode of assistance as the criterion power differentiates communication driven dss data driven dss document driven dss knowledge driven dss and model driven dss 6 a communication driven dss supports more than one person working on a shared task examples include integrated tools like microsoft s netmeeting or groove 7 a data driven dss or data oriented dss emphasizes access to and manipulation of a time series of internal company data and sometimes external data a document driven dss manages retrieves and manipulates unstructured information in a variety of electronic formats a knowledge driven dss provides specialized problem solving expertise stored as facts rules procedures or in similar structures 6 a model driven dss emphasizes access to and manipulation of a statistical financial optimization or simulation model model driven dss use data and parameters provided by users to assist decision makers in analyzing a situation they are not necessarily data intensive dicodess is an example of an open source model driven dss generator 8 using scope as the criterion power 9 differentiates enterprise wide dss and desktop dss an enterprise wide dss is linked to large data warehouses and serves many managers in the company a desktop single user dss is a small system that runs on an individual manager s pc edit components design of a drought mitigation decision support system three fundamental components of a dss architecture are 5 6 10 11 12 the database or knowledge base the model i e the decision context and user criteria and the user interface the users themselves are also important components of the architecture 5 12 edit development frameworks dss systems are not entirely different from other systems and require a structured approach such a framework includes people technology and the development approach 10 dss technology levels of hardware and software may include the actual application that will be used by the user this is the part of the application that allows the decision maker to make decisions in a particular problem area the user can act upon that particular problem generator contains hardware software environment that allows people to easily develop specific dss applications this level makes use of case tools or systems such as crystal analytica and ithink tools include lower level hardware software dss generators including special languages function libraries and linking modules an iterative developmental approach allows for the dss to be changed and redesigned at various intervals once the system is designed it will need to be tested and revised where necessary for the desired outcome edit classification there are several ways to classify dss applications not every dss fits neatly into one of the categories but may be a mix of two or more architectures holsapple and whinston 13 classify dss into the following six frameworks text oriented dss database oriented dss spreadsheet oriented dss solver oriented dss rule oriented dss and compound dss a compound dss is the most popular classification for a dss it is a hybrid system that includes two or more of the five basic structures described by holsapple and whinston 13 the support given by dss can be separated into three distinct interrelated categories 14 personal support group support and organizational support dss components may be classified as inputs factors numbers and characteristics to analyze user knowledge and expertise inputs requiring manual analysis by the user outputs transformed data from which dss decisions are generated decisions results generated by the dss based on user criteria dsss which perform selected cognitive decision making functions and are based on artificial intelligence or intelligent agents technologies are called intelligent decision support systems idss citation needed the nascent field of decision engineering treats the decision itself as an engineered object and applies engineering principles such as design and quality assurance to an explicit representation of the elements that make up a decision edit applications as mentioned above there are theoretical possibilities of building such systems in any knowledge domain one example is the clinical decision support system for medical diagnosis other examples include a bank loan officer verifying the credit of a loan applicant or an engineering firm that has bids on several projects and wants to know if they can be competitive with their costs dss is extensively used in business and management executive dashboard and other business performance software allow faster decision making identification of negative trends and better allocation of business resources due to dss all the information from any organization is represented in the form of charts graphs i e in a summarized way which helps the management to take strategic decision a growing area of dss application concepts principles and techniques is in agricultural production marketing for sustainable development for example the dssat4 package 15 16 developed through financial support of usaid during the 80 s and 90 s has allowed rapid assessment of several agricultural production systems around the world to facilitate decision making at the farm and policy levels there are however many constraints to the successful adoption on dss in agriculture 17 dss are also prevalent in forest management where the long planning time frame demands specific requirements all aspects of forest management from log transportation harvest scheduling to sustainability and ecosystem protection have been addressed by modern dsss a specific example concerns the canadian national railway system which tests its equipment on a regular basis using a decision support system a problem faced by any railroad is worn out or defective rails which can result in hundreds of derailments per year under a dss cn managed to decrease the incidence of derailments at the same time other companies were experiencing an increase edit benefits improves personal efficiency speed up the process of decision making increases organizational control encourages exploration and discovery on the part of the decision maker speeds up problem solving in an organization facilitates interpersonal communication promotes learning or training generates new evidence in support of a decision creates a competitive advantage over competition reveals new approaches to thinking about the problem space helps automate
