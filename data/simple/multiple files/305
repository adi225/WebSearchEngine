discovery at the site in the west the first public libraries were established under the roman empire as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor unlike

records give only a few instances of lending features as a rule roman public libraries were bilingual they had a latin room and a greek room most of the large roman baths were also cultural centres

the available persian greek roman and sanskrit non fiction and the classics of literature this flowering of islamic learning ceased centuries later when learning began declining in the islamic world after many of these libraries were destroyed by mongol invasions others were victim of wars and religious strife in the islamic world however a few examples of these medieval libraries such as the libraries of chinguetti in west africa remain intact and relatively unchanged another ancient library from this period which is still operational and expanding is the central library of astan quds razavi in the iranian city of mashhad which has been operating for more than six centuries the contents of these islamic libraries were copied by christian monks in muslim christian border areas

borders of china in thailand libraries called ho trai were built throughout the country usually on stilts above a pond to prevent bugs from eating at the books in the early middle ages monastery libraries developed such as the important one at the abbey of montecassino in italy 23 books were usually chained to the shelves reflecting the fact that manuscripts which were created via the labour intensive process of hand copying were valuable possessions 24 despite this protectiveness many libraries loaned books if provided with security deposits usually money or a book of equal value lending was a means by which books could be copied and spread in 1212 the council of paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books reminding them that lending is one of the chief works of mercy 25 the early libraries located in monastic cloisters and associated with scriptoria were collections of lecterns with books chained to them shelves built above and between back to back lecterns were the beginning of bookpresses the chain was attached at the fore edge of a book rather than to its spine book presses came to be arranged in carrels perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows in order to maximize lighting with low bookcases in front of the windows this stall system ie fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by closely spaced windows was characteristic of english institutional libraries in european libraries bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the walls this wall system was first introduced on a large scale in spain s el

people in the biblioth que nationale 30 during the french revolution librarians were solely responsible for the bibliographic planning of the nation out of this came the implementation of the concept of library service the democratic extension of library services to the general public regardless of wealth or education 30 edit types many institutions make a distinction between a circulating or lending library where materials are expected and intended to be loaned to patrons institutions or other libraries and a reference library where material is not lent out modern libraries are often a mixture of both containing a general collection for circulation and a reference collection which is restricted to the library premises also increasingly digital collections enable broader access to

extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference in this sense lending none of their materials most academic research libraries at least in the u s and the u k now lend books but not periodicals or other materials many research libraries are attached to a parental organization and serve only members of that organization edit reference libraries a reference library does not lend books and other items instead they must be read at the library itself typically such libraries are used for research purposes for example at a university some items at reference libraries may be historical and even unique examples of reference libraries include the british library in london and the bodleian library at oxford university many libraries contain a reference section which holds books such as dictionaries which are common reference books and are therefore not lent out 36 such reference sections may be referred to as reading rooms which may also include newspapers and

be endowed for the benefit of users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was the francis trigge chained library in grantham lincolnshire established in 1598 the

parliament appointed a committee led by william ewart on public libraries to consider the necessity of establishing libraries through the nation in 1849 their report noted the poor condition of library service it recommended the establishment of free public libraries all over the country and it led to the public libraries act in 1850 which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10 000 to levy taxes for the support of public libraries another important act was the 1870 public school law which increased literacy thereby the demand for libraries so by 1877 more than 75 cities had established free libraries and by 1900 the number had reached 300 38 this finally marks the start of the public library as we know it and these acts influenced similar laws in other countries most

remains the prevailing method of classification used in the united states as the number of books in libraries increased so did the need for compact storage and access with adequate lighting giving birth to the stack system which involved keeping a library s collection of books in a space separate from the reading room this arrangement arose in the 19th century book stacks quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the cast iron and steel frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors which often were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light but were not transparent for reasons of modesty the introduction of electrical lighting had a huge impact on how the library operated the use of glass floors was largely discontinued though floors were still often composed of metal grating to allow air to circulate in multi story stacks as more space was needed a method of moving shelves on tracks compact shelving was introduced to cut down on otherwise wasted aisle space in china there were 2 925 public libraries in 2011 44 library 2 0 a term coined in 2005 is the library s response to the challenge of google and an attempt to meet the

commission library buildings are not librarians and their priorities may be different to conform it to a type of architecture unsuited to library purposes the appointment often by competition of an architect unschooled in the requirements of a library failure to consult with the librarian or with library experts much advancement has undoubtedly been made toward cooperation between architect and librarian when and many good designers have made library buildings their specialty nevertheless it seems that the ideal type of library is not yet realized the type so adapted to its purpose that it would be immediately recognized as such as is the case with school buildings at the present time when this does not mean that library constructions should conform rigidly to a fixed standard of appearance and arrangement but it does mean that the exterior should express as nearly as possible the purpose and functions of the interior 53 edit usage this section needs additional citations for

were the traditional method of organizing the list of resources and their location within a large library dynix was an early but long lasting and popular digital catalogue patrons may not know how to fully use the library s resources this can be due to some individuals unease in approaching a staff member ways in which a library s content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use an antiquated or clumsy search system or staff unwilling or untrained to engage their patrons will limit a library s usefulness in the public libraries of the united states beginning in the 19th century these problems drove the emergence of the library instruction movement which advocated library user education one of the early leaders was john cotton dana the basic form of library instruction is sometimes known as information literacy libraries should inform their users of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information before the computer age this was accomplished by the card catalogue a cabinet or multiple cabinets containing many drawers filled with index cards that identified books and other materials in a large library the card catalogue often filled a large room the emergence of the internet however has led to the adoption of electronic catalogue databases often referred to as webcats or as online public access catalogues opacs which allow users to search the library s holdings from any location with internet access this style of catalogue maintenance is compatible with new types of libraries such as digital libraries and distributed libraries as well as older libraries that have been retrofitted electronic catalogue databases are criticized by some who believe that the old card catalogue system was both easier to navigate and allowed retention of information by writing directly on the cards that is lost in the electronic systems 54 this argument is analogous to the debate over paper books and e books while libraries have been accused of precipitously throwing out valuable information in card catalogues most modern ones have nonetheless made the move to electronic catalogue databases large libraries may be scattered within multiple buildings across a town each having multiple floors with multiple rooms housing the resources across a series of shelves once a user has located a resource within the catalogue they

previous year 59 a 2003 report by the open e book forum found that close to a million e books had been sold in 2002 generating nearly 8 million in revenue 60 another example of the shift to digital libraries can be seen in cushing academy s decision to dispense with its library of printed books more than 20 000 volumes in all 160 and switch over entirely to digital media resources 61 stacks of the jos vasconcelos library in mexico city one claim to why there is a decrease in the usage of libraries stems from the observation of the research habits of undergraduate students enrolled in colleges and universities there have been claims that college undergraduates have become more used to retrieving information from the internet than a traditional library as each generation becomes more in tune with the internet their desire to retrieve information as quickly and easily as possible has increased finding information by simply searching the internet could be much easier and faster than reading an entire book in a survey conducted by netlibrary 93 of undergraduate students claimed that finding information online makes more sense to them than going to the library also 75 of students surveyed claimed that they did not have enough time to go to the library and that they liked the convenience of the internet while the retrieving information from the internet may be efficient and time saving than visiting a traditional library research has shown that undergraduates are most likely searching only 03 of the entire web 62 the information that they are finding might be easy to retrieve and more readily available but may not be as in depth as information from other resources such as the books available at a physical library in the mid 2000s swedish company distec invented a library book vending machine known as the golibrary that offers library books to people where there is no branch limited hours or high traffic locations such as el cerrito del norte bart station in california edit the internet a library may make use of the internet in a number of ways a library may make the contents of its catalogues searchable online some specialised search engines such as google scholar offer a way to facilitate searching for academic resources such as journal articles and research papers the online computer library center allows library records to be searched online through its worldcat database 63 websites such as librarything and amazon provide abstracts reviews and recommendations of books 63 libraries provide computers and internet access to allow people to search for information online 64 online information access is particularly attractive to younger library users 65 66 67 68 digitisation of books particularly those that are out of print in projects such as google books provides resources for library and other online users due to their holdings of valuable material some libraries are important partners for search engines such as google in realising the potential of such projects and have received reciprocal benefits in cases where they have negotiated effectively 69 as the prominence of and reliance on the internet has grown library services have moved the emphasis from mainly providing print resources to providing more computers and more internet access 70 libraries face a number of challenges in adapting to new ways of information seeking that may stress convenience over quality 71 reducing the priority of information literacy skills 72 the potential decline in library usage particularly reference services 73 puts the necessity for these services in doubt library scholars have acknowledged that libraries need to address the ways that they market their services if they are to compete with the internet and mitigate the risk of losing users 74 this includes promoting the information literacy skills training considered vital across the library profession 72 75 76 however marketing of services has to be adequately supported financially in order to be successful this can be problematic for library services that are publicly funded and find it difficult to justify diverting tight funds to apparently peripheral areas such as branding and marketing 77 edit associations see also list of library associations the international federation of library associations and institutions ifla is the leading international association of library organisations it is the global voice of the library and information profession and its annual conference provides a venue for librarians to learn from one another

libraries uk a consortium of 30 university and other research libraries in the united kingdom library bodies such as cilip formerly the library association founded 1877 may advocate the role that

support given to a public library for its financial and philosophical goals or needs most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library sometimes by advocacy groups such as friends of libraries originally library advocacy was centred on the library itself but current trends show libraries positioning themselves to demonstrate they provide economic value to the community 85 edit laws this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources

books within its intellectual tradition and educational system 87 an early impulse in islam was to manage reports of events key figures and their sayings and actions thus the onus of being the last people of the book engendered an ethos of librarianship 88 early on and the establishment of important book repositories throughout the muslim world has occurred ever since upon the spread of islam libraries in newly islamic lands knew a brief period of expansion in the middle east north africa sicily and spain like the christian libraries they mostly contained books which were made of paper and took a codex or modern form instead of scrolls they could be found in mosques private homes and universities from timbuktu to afghanistan and modern day pakistan in aleppo for example the largest and probably the oldest mosque library the sufiya located at the city s grand umayyad mosque contained a large book collection of which 10 000 volumes were reportedly bequeathed by the city s most famous ruler prince sayf al dawla 89 ibn al nadim s bibliography fihrist demonstrates the devotion of medieval muslim scholars to books and reliable sources it contains a description of thousands of books
