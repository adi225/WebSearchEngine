semma is an acronym that stands for sample explore modify model and assess it is a list of sequential steps developed by sas institute inc one of the largest producers of statistics and business intelligence software it guides the implementation of data mining applications 1 although semma is often considered to be a general data mining methodology sas claims that it is rather a logical organisation of the functional tool set of one of their products sas enterprise miner for carrying out the core tasks of data mining 2 contents 1 background 2 phases of semma 3 criticism 4 see also 5 references edit background in the expanding field of data mining there has been a call for a standard methodology or a simply list of best practices for the deverisified and iterative process of data mining that users can apply to their data mining projects regardless of industry while the cross industry standard process for data mining or crisp dm founded by the european strategic program on research in information technology initiative aimed to create a netural methodology sas also offered a pattern to follow in its data mining tools edit phases of semma the phases of semma and related tasks are the following 2 sample the process starts with data sampling e g selecting the data set for modeling the data set should be large enough to contain sufficient information to retrieve yet small enough to be used efficiently this phase also deals with data partitioning explore this phase covers the understanding of the data by discovering anticipated and unanticipated relationships between the variables and also abnormalities with the help of data visualization modify the modify phase contains methods to select create and transform variables in preparation for data modeling model in the model phase the focus is on applying various modeling data mining techniques on the prepared variables in order to create models that possibly provide the desired outcome assess the last phase is assess the evaluation of the modeling results shows the reliability and usefulness of the created models edit criticism semma mainly focuses on the modeling tasks of data mining projects leaving the business aspects out unlike i e crisp dm and its business understanding phase additionally semma is designed to help the users of the sas enterprise miner software therefore applying it outside enterprise miner can be ambiguous 3 edit see also cross industry standard process for data mining edit references azevedo a and santos m f kdd semma and crisp dm a parallel overview in proceedings of the iadis european conference on data mining 2008 pp 182 185 a b sas enterprise miner website rohanizadeh s s and moghadam m b a proposed data mining methodology and its application to industrial procedures journal of industrial engineering 4 2009 pp 37 50
