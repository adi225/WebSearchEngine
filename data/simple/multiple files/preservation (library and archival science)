and archives dates from the twentieth century but its philosophy and practice has roots in many earlier traditions 4 in many ancient societies appeals to heavenly protectors were used to preserve books scrolls and manuscripts from insects fire and decay to the ancient egyptians the scarab or dung beetle see scarab artifact was a protector of written products the scarab was also used as a holder or medium for personal name seals a figurine of a scarab would be carved out of stone and then on the smooth stomach of the scarab the engraving of a seal was made later this oval image was used for the representation of the cartouche or name title seals 5 in ancient babylon nabu is the heavenly patron of books and protector of clay tablets nabu is the babylonian god of wisdom and writing and is the patron of the scribes librarians and archivists nabu s symbols are the clay writing tablet with the cuneiform writing stylus he usually wears a horned cap and often stands with his hands clasped together in the ancient gesture of priesthood nabu engraves the destiny of each person as the gods have decided on the tablets of sacred record thus nabu has the power to increase or diminish at will the length of human life the image of nabu is also one of the images on the brass doors designed by lee lawrie entitled a history of the written word on the john adams building of the library of congress the figures on the doors also include thoth an egyptian god ts ang chieh or cangjie the chinese patron of writing nabu an akkadian god brahma the indian god cadmus the greek sower of dragon s teeth and tahmurath or tahmuras a hero of the ancient persians in hindu beliefs ganesh ganesvha or ganapati is the elephant headed god of learning and new enterprises as the god of wisdom he knows all since he has the head of an elephant he also has the reputed memory of the elephant and thus does not forget anything his statue is placed over the doors of and entrances of many buildings in india and sri lanka including most libraries ganesh is the scribe who wrote the mahabharata great epic of the bharata dynasty from vyasa s dictation ganesh is credited with inventing the sanskrit alphabet and he broke off his right tusk to make the first pen as the inventor of the alphabet as a scribe and as a keeper of wisdom and knowledge ganesh is credited as a patron of libraries librarians and book sellers and buyers in arabic and other eastern societies sometimes a traditional method to protect books and scrolls was a metaphysical appeal to kabi kaj the king of the cockroaches by appealing to the king to protect a manuscript cockroaches of less nobility or lesser insects would refrain from intruding on documents which could be eaten by the king only since many manuscripts were made with fish glue starch paste leather and other tasty substances insect appetites were a constant and never ending problem to arabic books and scrolls 6 a similar technique from syria was to name the first and last page of a document or manuscript the page of the king of the cockroaches in the hope that the cockroach king will control all other insects translated appeals include o kabi kaj save the paper o kabi kaj save this book from the worms and o kabi kaj do not eat this paper 7 in maghribi manuscripts the word appears in its evidently corrupt form kaykataj and is clearly used as a talisman and mentions after a certain muhammad al samiri that when one writes kaytataj on the first and last folio of the book one can be sure that worms will not attack it 8 there are three saints in the christian church that are closely associated with libraries as patrons saint lawrence is an early saint of the church who seems to be more respected in european libraries than those in the western hemisphere saint jerome is most often considered the patron saint of libraries in the us and canada 9 saint catharine of alexandria or catherine of alexandria is most often considered the patroness of libraries in the orthodox tradition in some christian monasteries prayers and curses were placed at the end of books to prevent theft or to damn the thieves frequently called a book curse these were placed in the book to deter theft for him that stealeth a book from this library may it change into a serpent in his hand and rend him may he be struck with palsy and all his members blasted may bookworms gnaw his entrails in token of the worm which dieth not and when at last he goeth to his final perdition let the flames of hell consume him forever and aye 10 another example of a christian curse is this medieval jingle placed at the end of a work christ s curse upon the crook who takes away this book or in the latin sit maledictuus per christum qui librum subraxerit istum 11 the ancient chinese god wei t o is the patron god of libraries and books many examples of appeals to wei t o can be found in chinese manuscripts dated five hundred or more years ago sometimes the last page of manuscripts would be dedicated to him in a manner very similar to the arabic prayer of protection to the king of the cockroaches wei t o an ancient chinese god protects books against destruction from fire worms and insects and robbers big or small 12 wei t o is especially invoked for the protection of books and libraries against fire since the modern books are suffering from acid decomposition slow fires wei t o is especially relevant to modern librarianship a modern product to de acidify paper is named in his honor sri lankan symbols or images of the sinhalese fire demons are hung in the corners of libraries and other buildings to appease the incendiary demons and to avert fire lightning and cataclysm according to sinhalese mythology the fire demons from ceylon have no body and show only a grinning face surrounded by flames the expressions shown on the figures are of delirious glee or insane pleasure as these demons eventually burn themselves up leaving only charcoal and ashes and dust these demons especially appreciate large amounts of paper such as books or magazines as they are ready fuel for their infernal fires needless to say these fire demons are hung up around banks and currency exchange offices as well to avert catastrophe to other paper products since fire and acid decomposition also known as slow fires are a special problem for libraries because of the concentration of paper products the fire demons are also included when used to assuage these destroyers of libraries and books the aztec and mayan indians of latin america also had deities concerned with libraries the major god quetzalcoatl is credited with the discoveries of the arts the calendar and of writing a single feather or plume at the beginning or at the end of a document or stone carving would indicate a dedication to the feathered serpent this symbol degenerated over time to a single fringed line in library science preservation is treated as an active and intentional process as opposed to the passive sense of preservation that might be applied to paleontological or archaeological finds the survival of these items is a matter of chance from an information science perspective while the preservation of them after their discovery is a matter of intentional activity human record keeping arguably dates back to the cave painting boom of the upper paleolithic some 32 000 40 000 years ago more direct antecedents are the writing systems that developed in the 4th millennium b c written record keeping and information sharing practices along with oral tradition sustain and transmit information from one group to another this level of preservation has been supplemented over the last century with the professional practice of preservation and conservation in the cultural heritage community oral tradition or oral culture the transmission of information from one generation to the next without a writing system antiquarian practices including scribal practice burial practice the libraries at pergamum alexandria and other ancient archives medieval practices including the scriptorium and relic collection renaissance and the changing conception of artists and works of art enlightenment and the encyclopedists romantic movement s imperative to preserve edit significant events 1933 william barrow introduces the field of conservation to paper deacidification when he publishes a paper on the acid paper problem in later studies barrow tested paper from american books made between 1900 and 1949 and learned that after forty years the books had lost on average 96 percent of their original strength after less than ten years they had already lost 64 percent barrow determined that this rapid deterioration was not the direct result of using wood pulp fibers since rag papers of this period were also aging rapidly but rather due to the residual sulfuric acid produced in both rag and wood pulp papers manufacturing methods used after 1870 employed sulfuric acid for sizing and bleaching the paper earlier papermaking methods left the final product only mildly alkaline or even neutral such paper has maintained its strength for 300 to 800 years despite sulfur dioxide and other air pollutants 13 barrow s 1933 article on the fragile state of wood pulp paper predicted the life expectancy or le of this paper was approximately 40 50 years at that point the paper would begin to show signs of natural decay and he concluded that research for a new media on which to write and print was needed 1966 the flood of the river arno in florence italy damaged or destroyed millions of rare books and led to the development of restoration laboratories and new methods in conservation instrumental in this process was conservationist peter waters who led a group of volunteers called mud angels in restoring thousands of books and papers this event awakened many historians librarians and other professionals to the importance of having a preservation plan many consider this flood to be one of the worst disasters since the burning of the alexandria library in ancient rome it spurred a resurgence in the profession of preservation and conservation worldwide 1987 terry saunders releases the film slow fires on the preservation of the human record which examines paper embrittlement resulting from acid decay 1989 march 7 commitment day major us print publishers convene at nypl to endorse a community wide commitment to utilizing iso 9706 certified permanent durable paper in order to combat the acid paper epidemic edit significant people in the history of preservation william barrow 1904 1967 was an american chemist and paper conservator and a pioneer of library and archives conservation he introduced the field of conservation to paper deacidification through alkalization paul n banks 1934 2000 was conservator and head of the conservation department at the newberry library from 1964 to 1981 and published regularly on bookbinding book and paper conservation and problems related to conservation he designed and implemented a curriculum for columbia university s school of library science that dealt directly with preservation training pamela darling author and historian was preservation specialist for the association of research libraries her works include materials to aid libraries in establishing their own comprehensive preservation programs carolyn harris worked as head of columbia university libraries preservation division from 1981 until 1987 where she worked closely with paul

collections edit environmental controls environmental controls are necessary to facilitate the preservation of organic library materials and are especially important to monitor in rare and special collections key environmental factors to watch include temperature relative humidity pests pollutants and light exposure in general the lower the temperature is the better it is for the collection however since books and other materials are often housed in areas with people a compromise must be struck to accommodate human comfort a reasonable temperature to accomplish both goals is 65 68 f however if possible film and photography collections should be kept in a segregated area at 55 f 17 books and other materials take up and give off moisture making them sensitive to relative humidity very high humidity encourages mold growth and insect infestations low humidity causes materials to lose their flexibility fluctuations in relative humidity are more damaging than a constant humidity in the middle or low range generally the relative humidity should be between 30 50 with as little variation as possible however recommendations on specific levels to maintain vary depending on the type of material i e paper based film etc 18 a specialized dew point calculator for book preservation is available 19 pests such as insects and vermin eat and destroy paper and the adhesive that secures book bindings food and drink in libraries archives and museums can increase the attraction of pests 20 an integrated pest management system is one way to control pests in libraries particulate and gaseous pollutants such as soot ozone sulfur dioxide oxides of nitrogen can cause dust soiling and irreversible molecular damage to materials pollutants are exceedingly small and not easily detectable or removable a special filtration system in the building s hvac is a helpful defense exposure to light also has a significant effect on library materials it is not only the light visible to humans that can cause damage but also ultraviolet light and infrared radiation measured in lux or the amount of lumens m 2 the generally accepted level of illumination with sensitive materials is limited to 50 lux per day materials receiving more lux than recommended can be placed in dark storage periodically to prolong the original appearance of the object 21 recent concerns about the impact of climate change on the management of cultural heritage objects as well as the historic environment 22 has prompted research efforts to investigate alternative climate control methods and strategies 23 that include the implementation of alternative climate control systems to replace or supplement traditional high energy consuming hvac systems as well as the introduction of passive preservation techniques 24 rather than maintaining a flat line consistent 24 7 condition for a collection s environment fluctuation can occur within acceptable limits to create a preservation environment while also thinking of energy efficiency and taking advantage of the outside environment 25 bound materials are sensitive to rapid temperature or humidity cycling due to differential expansion of the binding and pages which may cause the binding to crack and or the pages to warp changes in temperature and humidity should be done slowly so as to minimize the difference in expansion rates however an accelerated aging study on the effects of fluctuating temperature and humidity on paper color and strength showed no evidence that cycling of one temperature to another or one rh to another caused a different mechanism of decay 26 edit decision making and criteria making a proper decision is an important factor before starting preservation practices decision making for preservation should be made considering significance and value of materials significance is considered to have two major components importance and quality 27 importance relates to the collection s role as a record and quality covers comprehensiveness depth uniqueness authenticity and reputation of the collection moreover analyzing the significance of materials can be used to uncover more about their meaning 28 assessment of significance can also aid in documenting the provenance and context to argue the case for grant funding for the object and collection 29 forms of significance can be historically culturally socially or spiritually significant in the preservation context libraries and archives make decisions in different ways in libraries decision making likely targets existing holding materials whereas in archives decisions for preservation are often made when they acquire materials therefore different criteria might be needed on different occasions in general for archive criteria the points include 1 the characteristics of a record purpose creator etc 2 the quality of the information in the record 3 the record in context part of a series or not 4 potential use and possible limitations and 5 the cost against the benefits from its existence 30 for library criteria the following are evidence of significance 1 uniqueness 2 irreplaceability 3 high level of impact over time or place 4 high level of influence 5 representation of a type and 6 comparative value rarity completeness integrity relative to others of its kind 31 edit selection since the 1970s the northeast document conservation center has stated that the study of understanding the needs of the library is inherently important to the survival of archives and libraries in order for the preservation of a collection to survive for a long time it is important that a systematic preservation plan is in place the first step in planning a preservation program is to assess the institution s existing preservation needs this process entails identifying the general and specific needs of the collection establishing priorities and gathering the resources to execute the plan 32 because budget and time limitations require priorities to be set standards have been established by the profession to determine what should be preserved in a collection considerations include existing condition rarity and evidentiary and market values with non paper formats the availability of equipment to access the information will be a factor for example playback equipment for audio visual materials or microform readers an institution should determine how many if any other repositories hold the material and consider coordinating efforts with those that do 33 institutions should establish an environment conducive to preservation changes involve staff and create an understanding among administration and staff the first steps an institution should implement according to the nedcc are to establish a policy that defines and charts the course of action and create a framework for carrying out goals and priorities there are three methods for carrying out a preservation survey general preservation assessment collection condition surveys and an item by item survey 34 general condition surveys can be part of a library inventory selection for treatment determines the survival of materials and should be done by a specialist whether in relation to an established collection development policy or on an item by item basis 35 once an object or collection has been chosen for preservation the treatment must be determined that is most appropriate to the material and its repository if the information is most important reformatting or creation of a surrogate is a likely option if the artifact itself is of value it will receive conservation treatment ideally of a reversible nature 33 edit research and testing with old media deteriorating or showing their vulnerabilities and new media becoming available research remains active in the field of conservation and preservation everything from how to preserve paper media to creating and maintaining electronic resources is being explored by students and professionals in library and information science the two main issues that most libraries tend to face are the rapid disintegration of acidic paper and water damage due to flooding plumbing problems etc therefore these areas of preservation as well as new digital technologies receive much of the research attention the american library association has many scholarly journals that publish articles on preservation topics such as college and research libraries information technology and libraries and library resources and technical services scholarly periodicals in this field from other publishers include international preservation news journal of the american institute for conservation and collection management among many others edit ethics conservators should refer to the aic code of ethics and guidelines for practice 36 which states that the conservation professional must strive to attain the highest possible standards in all aspects of conservation ethics will play an important role in many aspects of the conservator s activities when choosing which objects are in need of treatment the conservator should do what is best for the object in question and not yield to pressure or opinion from outside sources edit preservation of cultural objects one instance in which these decisions may get tricky is when the conservator is dealing with cultural objects the aic code of ethics and guidelines for practice has addressed such concerns stating all actions of the conservation professional must be governed by an informed respect for cultural property its unique character and significance and the people or person who created it this can be applied in both the care and longterm storage of objects in archives and institutions the aic code of ethics and guidelines for practice also states while recognizing the right of society to make appropriate and respectful use of cultural property the conservation professional shall serve as an advocate for the preservation of cultural property this statement speaks to the conservator s need to balance his or her duty to conserve objects and maintain a collection with society s right to have access and use of objects for their own cultural religious purposes while it is obvious that a member of a religion should be able to have access to an object or text that has spiritual value to them it would be against the conservator s ethics to then allow that object to incur damage from such use the conservator should make sure that the care of the object is kept in mind when access to an object is granted the object should remain in the best condition possible not only so it is preserved for prosperity but also so that it can be studied by researchers and by members of the cultural or religious group that created it it is important that preservation specialists to be respectful of cultural property and the societies that created it it is also important for them to be aware of international and national laws pertaining to stolen items the aic code of ethics and guidelines for practice also states that the conservation professional should be cognizant of laws and regulations that may have a bearing on professional activity among these laws and regulations are those concerning the rights of artists and their estates occupational health and safety sacred and religious material excavated objects endangered species human remains and stolen property in recent years there has been a rise in nations seeking out artifacts that have been stolen and are now in museums in many cases museums are working with the nations to find a compromise to balance the need for reliable supervision as well as access for both the public and researchers 37 conservators are not just bound by ethics to treat cultural and religious objects with respect but also in some cases by law for example in the united states conservators must comply with the native american graves protection and repatriation act nagpra the first archivists circle a group of native american archivists has also created protocols for native american archival materials the non binding guidelines are suggestions for libraries and archives with native american archival materials with all these issues of respect and cultural sensitivity to consider conservation and preservation issues are sure to arise the care of cultural and sacred objects often affects the physical storage or the object for example sacred objects of the native peoples of the western united states are supposed to be stored with sage to ensure their spiritual well being the idea of storing an object with plant material is inherently problematic to an archival collection because of the possibility of insect infestation when conservators have faced this problem they have addressed it by using freeze dried sage thereby meeting both conservation and cultural needs some individuals in the library science community have explored the possible moral responsibility to preserve all cultural phenomena in regards to the concept of monumental preservation 38 other advocates argue that such an undertaking is something that the indigenous or native communities that produce such cultural objects are better suited to perform currently however many indigenous communities are not financially able to support their own archives and museums still indigenous archives are on the rise in the united states 39 edit preservation and the library as a sacred institution in her book sacred stacks the higher purpose of libraries and librarianship nancy kalikow maxwell discusses how libraries are capable of performing some of the same functions as religion 40 many librarians feel that their work is done for some higher purpose 40 the same can be said for preservation librarians one instance of the library s role as sacred is to provide a sense of immortality with the ever changing world outside the library will remain stable and dependable 40 preservation is a great help in this regard through digitization and reformatting preservation librarians are able to retain material while at the same time adapting to new methods in this way libraries can adapt to the changes in user needs without changing the quality of the material itself through preservation efforts patrons can rest assured that although materials are constantly deteriorating over time the library itself will remain a stable reliable environment for their information needs another sacred ability of the library is to provide information and a connection to the past 40 by working to slow down the processes of deterioration and decay of library materials preservation practices help keep this link to the past alive edit regional centers the conservation center for art and historic artifacts in philadelphia pa ccaha is a non profit conservation laboratory specializing in the treatment of art and historic artifacts on paper the center also trains museum and library professionals in disaster planning records and archives management the northeast document conservation center in andover ma since its inception in 1973 the center has instructed institutions and organizations as well as librarians conservators preservationists and museum professionals in preservation care and procedures from 1995 to 2007 nedcc presented its school for scanning conference eleven times in cities across the united states the school takes a leading role for digital preservation lyrasis is a not for profit membership cooperative of libraries and other information organizations in the southeastern united states established in 1973 as the largest regional library network in the u s lyrasis provides a variety of preservation education programs and workshops edit vendor services many private entities provide preservation and conservation services and supplies edit branches of preservation edit standard functions of preservation programs collections care refers to the general maintenance and preventive care of a collection as a whole this can include activities such as security environmental monitoring preservation surveys and more specialized activities such as mass deacidification conservation refers to the treatment and repair of individual items to slow decay or restore them to a usable state conservation is occasionally used interchangeably with preservation particularly outside the professional literature digital preservation refers to the maintenance of digitally stored information this should not be confused with digitization which is a process of creating digital information which must in turn be digitally preserved means of digital preservation include refreshing migration replication and emulation disaster preparedness rt disaster plan business continuation disaster recovery disaster mitigation plan refers to the practice of arranging for the necessary resources and planning the best course of action to prevent or minimize

field of preservation today is educating a library s community especially librarians and other staff in the best ways to handle materials as well as the conditions in which particular materials will decay the least this challenge is exacerbated by the fact that preservation is a peripheral element of most library science curricula indeed there are few places where one can receive a specialized education in preservation one of the primary degree granting institutions for library and archival preservation is the university of texas at austin s school of information science the conservation and preservation program is offered in partnership with the kilgarlin center for preservation of the cultural record and trains both conservators and preservation administrators there are a number of other preservation administration programs in the united states including the university of michigan school of information which specializes in digital preservation management recently the institute for museum and library services imls has funded a number of digital curation education programs around the united states including at the university of north carolina at chapel hill digital curation includes the activity of digital preservation management other conservation programs in the united states focus on art conservation and are considered to be more museum focused than library focused these programs are all part of the association of north american graduate programs in the conservation of cultural property anagpic 41 the rutgers preservation management institute provides post graduate training in preservation administration for working librarians who have already completed a master s degree 42 ut austin also offers certificates of advanced study in conservation 43 and preservation to librarians who already hold their mls 44 another educational resource available to preservationists is the northeast document conservation center or nedcc 45 this institution was founded in 1973 as a reaction to the growing problem of paper deterioration occurring in repositories in the new england area the center provides institutions and organizations as well as librarians conservators preservationists and museum professionals with help in learning proper care and procedures to better preserve the integrity of their collections the institution provides a variety of services such as imaging surveys and consultations and digitation they also assist with disaster planning the educational opportunities it provides include provision of workshops conferences and specialized trainings additional online courses are also available for instance some of the workshops offered by the nedcc include basic preservation collections care emergency preparedness integrated pest management ipm identification and care of photographs basic and intermediate book repair basic paper repair preservation of scrapbooks preservation technologies holdings maintenance creating and maintaining digital collections scanning training and grant writing 46 additionally the nedcc is responsible for the creation of a preservation education curriculum which has been made available online to serve as an instructional aid for introductory preservation courses taught at library and information science schools 47 additional preservation education is available to librarians through

can often interfere with the ability for public libraries to engage in extensive preservation activities materials particularly books are often much easier to replace than to repair when damaged or worn public libraries usually try to tailor their services to meet the needs and desires of their local communities which could cause an emphasis on acquiring new materials over preserving old ones librarians working in public facilities frequently have to make complicated decisions about how to best serve their patrons commonly public library systems work with each other and sometimes with more academic libraries through interlibrary loan programs by sharing resources they are able to expand upon what might be available to their own patrons and share the burdens of preservation across a greater array of systems edit archival repositories and special collections archival facilities focus specifically on rare and fragile materials with staff trained in appropriate techniques archives are often available to many public and private library facilities as an alternative to destroying older materials items that are unique such as photographs or items that are out of print can be preserved in archival facilities more easily than in many library settings 60 edit museums because so many museum holdings are unique including print materials art and other objects preservationists are often most active in this setting edit legal issues reformatting or in any other way copying an item s contents raises obvious copyright issues in many cases a library is allowed to make a limited number of copies of an item for preservation purposes in the united states certain exceptions have been made for libraries and archives 61 edit criticism there is a longstanding tension between preservation of and access to library materials particularly in the area of special collections handling materials promotes their progression to an unusable state especially if they are handled carelessly on the other hand materials must be used in order to gain any benefit from them in a collection with valuable materials this conflict is often resolved by a number of measures which can include heightened security requiring the use of gloves for photographs restricting the materials researchers may bring with them into a reading room and restricting use of materials to patrons who are not able to satisfy their research needs with less valuable copies of an item these restrictions are annoyances to researchers who feel that these measures are in place solely to keep materials out of the hands of the public there is also controversy surrounding preservation methods a major controversy at the end of the twentieth century centered on the practice of discarding items that had been microfilmed this was the subject of novelist nicholson baker s book double fold which chronicled his efforts to save many old runs of american newspapers formerly owned by the british library from being sold to dealers or pulped a similar concern persists over the retention of original documents reformatted by any means analog or digital concerns include scholarly needs and legal requirements for authentic or original records as well as questions about the longevity quality and completeness of reformatted materials 62 63 retention of originals as a source or fail safe copy is now a fairly common practice another controversy revolving around different preservation methods is that of digitization of original material to maintain the intellectual content of the material while ignoring the physical nature of the book 64 further the modern language association s committee on the future of the print record structured its statement on the significance of primary records on the inherent theoretical ideology that there is a need to preserve as many copies of a printed edition as is possible as texts and their textual settings are quite simply not separable just as the artifactual characteristics of texts are as relevant and varied as the texts themselves in the report mentioned herewith g thomas tanselle suggests that presently existing book stacks need not be abandoned with emerging technologies rather they serve as vitally important original primary sources for future study 65 many digitized items such as back issues of periodicals are provided by publishers and databases on a subscription basis if these companies were to cease providing access to their digital information facilities that elected to discard paper copies of these periodicals could face significant difficulties in providing access to these items discussion as to the best ways to utilize digital technologies is therefore ongoing and the practice continues to evolve of
