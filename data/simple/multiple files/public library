library that is accessible by the public and is generally funded from public sources such as tax money and operated by civil servants there are five fundamental characteristics shared by public libraries the first is that they are generally supported by taxes usually local though any level of government can and may contribute they are governed by a board to serve the public interest they are

without charge 1 public libraries exist in many countries across the world and are often considered an essential part of having an educated and literate population public libraries are distinct from research libraries school libraries and other special libraries in that their mandate is to serve the general public s information needs rather than the needs of a particular school institution or

origins as a social institution the culmination of centuries of advances in the printing press moveable type paper ink publishing and distribution combined with an ever growing middle class increased commercial activity and consumption new radical ideas massive population growth and higher literacy rates forged the public library into the form that it is today public libraries are not a new idea romans made scrolls in dry rooms available to patrons of the baths and tried with some success to establish libraries within the empire naturally only those few that could afford an education would be able to use the library where those less than rich or without control of money women children and slaves could not in the middle of the 19th century the push for truly public libraries paid for by taxes and run by the state gained force after numerous depressions droughts wars and revolutions in europe felt mostly by the working class matthew battles states that it was in these years of class conflict and economic terror that the public library movement swept through britain as the nation s progressive elite recognized that the light of cultural and intellectual energy was lacking in the lives of commoners 10 libraries had often been started with a donation an endowment or were bequeathed to various parishes churches schools or towns and these social and institutional libraries formed the base of many academic and public library collections of today andrew carnegie had the biggest influence in financing libraries in the united states of america from the east to west coast from just 1900 to 1917 almost 1 700 libraries were constructed by carnegie s foundation insisting that local communities first guarantee tax support of each library built 11 branch library at bankfield museum the establishment of circulating libraries by booksellers and publishers provided a means of gaining profit and creating social centers within the community the circulating libraries not only provided a place to sell books but also a place to lend books for a price these circulating libraries provided a variety of materials including the increasingly popular novels although the circulating libraries filled an important role in society members of the middle and upper classes often looked down upon these libraries that regularly sold material from their collections and provided materials that were less sophisticated circulating libraries also charged a subscription fee however the fees were set to entice their patrons providing subscriptions on a yearly quarterly or monthly basis without expecting the subscribers to purchase a share in the circulating library citation needed circulating libraries were not exclusively lending institutions and often provided a place for other forms of commercial activity which may or may not be related to print this was necessary because the circulating libraries did not generate enough funds through subscription fees collected from its borrowers as a commerce venture it was important to consider the contributing factors such as other goods or services available to the subscribers 12 many claims have been made for the title of first public library for various libraries in various countries with at least some of the confusion arising from differing interpretations of what should be considered a true public library difficulties in establishing what policies were in effect at different times in the history of particular libraries also add to the confusion the first libraries open to the public were the collections of greek and latin scrolls which were available in the dry sections of the many buildings that made up the huge roman baths of the roman empire however they were not lending libraries the halls of science run by different islamic sects in many cities of north africa and the middle east in the 9th century were open to the public some of them had written lending policies but they were very restrictive most patrons were expected to consult the books on site the later european university libraries were not open to the general public but accessible by scholars edit history edit united kingdom the earliest

leicester 1632 shrewsbury school also opened its library to townsfolk 17 in bristol an early library that allowed access to the public was that of the kalendars or kalendaries a brotherhood of clergy and laity who were attached to the church of all hallowen or all saints records show that in 1464 provision was made for a library to be erected in the house of the kalendars and reference is made to a deed of that date by which it was appointed that all who wish to enter for the sake of instruction shall have free access and recess at certain times citation needed edit early 18th century at the start of the 18th century libraries were becoming increasingly public and were more frequently lending libraries the 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial libraries to lending libraries before this time public libraries were parochial in nature and libraries frequently chained their books to desks 18 libraries also were not uniformly open to the public in 1790 the public library act would not be passed for another sixty seven years 19 even though the british museum existed at this time and contained over 50 000 books the national library was not open to the public or even to a majority of the population access to the museum depended on passes of which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks moreover the library was not open to browsing once a pass to the library had been issued the reader was taken on a tour of the library many readers complained that the tour was much too short 20 at the start of the 19th century there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term i e libraries provided from public funds and freely accessible to all 21 only one important library in great britain namely chetham s library in manchester was fully and freely accessible to the public 21 however there had come into being a whole network of library provision on a private or institutional basis subscription libraries both private and commercial provided the middle and middle to upper class with a variety of books for moderate fees the increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the spread of lending libraries especially the commercial subscription libraries commercial subscription libraries began when booksellers began renting out extra copies of books in the mid 18th century steven fischer estimates that in 1790 there were about six hundred rental and lending libraries with a clientele of some fifty thousand 22 the mid to late 18th century saw a virtual epidemic of feminine reading as novels became more and more popular 23 novels while frowned upon in society were extremely popular in england there were many who lamented at the villanous profane and obscene books and the opposition to the circulating library on moral grounds persisted well into the 19th century 24 still many establishments must have circulated many times the number of novels as of any other genre 25 in 1797 thomas wilson wrote in the use of circulating libraries consider that for a successful circulating library the collection must contain 70 fiction however the overall percentage of novels mainly depended on the proprietor of the circulating library while some circulating libraries were almost completely novels others had less than 10 of their overall collection in the form of novels 26 the national average start of the 20th century hovered around novels comprising about 20 of the total collection 27 novels varied from other types of books in many ways they were read primarily for enjoyment instead of for study they did not provide academic knowledge or spiritual guidance thus they were read quickly and far fewer times than other books these were the perfect books for commercial subscription libraries to lend since books were read for pure enjoyment rather than for scholarly work books needed to become both cheaper and smaller small duodecimo editions of books were preferred to the large folio editions folio editions were read at a desk while the small duodecimo editions could be easily read like the paperbacks of today much like paperbacks of today many of the novels in circulating libraries were unbound at this period of time many people chose to bind their books in leather many circulating libraries skipped this process circulating libraries were not in the business of preserving books their owners wanted to lend books as many times as they possibly could circulating libraries had ushered in a completely new way of reading 28 reading was no longer simply an academic pursuit or an attempt to gain spiritual guidance reading became a social activity many circulating libraries were attached to the shops of milliners or drapers they served as much for social gossip and the meeting of friends as coffee shops do today 29 another factor in the growth of subscription libraries was the increasing cost of books in the last two decades of the century especially prices were practically doubled so that a quarto work cost a guinea an octavo 10 shillings or 12 shillings and a duodecimo cost 4 shillings per volume price apart moreover books were difficult to procure outside london since local booksellers could not afford to carry large stocks 30 commercial libraries since they were usually associated with booksellers and also since they had a greater number of patrons were able to accumulate greater numbers of books the united public library was said to have a collection of some 52 000 volumes twice as many as any private subscription library in the country at that period 31 these libraries since they functioned as a business also lent books to non subscribers on a per book system 32 edit private subscription libraries private subscription libraries functioned in much the same manner as commercial subscription libraries though they varied in many important ways one of the most popular versions of the private subscription library was a gentleman s only library the gentlemen s subscription libraries sometimes known as proprietary libraries were nearly all organized on a common pattern membership was restricted to the proprietors or shareholders and ranged from a dozen or two to between four and five hundred the entrance fee i e the purchase price of a share was in early days usually a guinea but rose sharply as the century advanced often reaching four or five guineas during the french wars the annual subscription during the same period rose from about six shillings to ten shillings or more the book stock was by modern standards small liverpool with over 8 000 volumes in 1801 seems to have been the largest and was accommodated at the outset in makeshift premises very often over a bookshop with the bookseller acting as librarian and receiving an honorarium for his pains 33 the liverpool subscription library was a gentlemen only library in 1798 it was renamed the athenaeum when it was rebuilt with a newsroom and coffeehouse it had an entrance fee of one guinea and annual subscription of five shillings 34 while no records survive of the commercial library lendings we have the bristol library s continuous record of borrowings in seventy seven folio volumes from 1773 to 1857 an analysis of the registers for the first twelve years provides some fascinating glimpses of middle class reading habits in a mercantile community at this period the largest and most popular sections of the library were history antiquities and geography with 283 titles and 6 121 borrowings and belles lettres with 238 titles and 3 313 borrowings far below came theology and ecclesiastical history natural history and chemistry philosophy jurisprudence miscellanies mathematics etc and medicine and anatomy all with fewer than 100 titles 35 the most popular single work was john hawkesworth s account of voyages in the southern hemisphere 3 vols which was borrowed on 201 occasions the records also show that in 1796 membership had risen by 1 3 to 198 subscribers of whom 5 were women and the titles increased five fold to 4 987 this mirrors the increase in reading interests a patron list from the bath municipal library shows that from 1793 to 1799 the library held a stable 30 of their patrons as female 36 it was also uncommon for these libraries to have buildings designated solely as the library building during the 1790s though in the 19th century many libraries would begin building elaborate permanent residences bristol birmingham and liverpool were the few libraries with their own building 37 the accommodations varied from the shelf for a few dozen volumes in the country stationer s or draper s shop to the expansion to a back room to the spacious elegant areas of hookham s or those at the resorts like scarborough and four in a row at margate 38 private subscription libraries held a greater amount of control over both membership and the types of books in the library there was almost a complete elimination of cheap fiction in the private societies 39 subscription libraries prided themselves on respectability the highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors gentry and old professions 40 towards the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the nineteenth the need for books and general education made itself felt among social classes created by the beginnings of the industrial revolution 41 the late 18th century saw a rise in subscription libraries intended for the use of tradesmen in 1797 there was established at kendal what was known as the economical library designed principally for the use and instruction of the working classes 42 there was also the artizans library established at birmingham in 1799 the entrance fee was 3 shillings the subscription was 1 shilling 6 pence per quarter this was a library of general literature novels at first excluded were afterwards admitted on condition that they did not account for more than one tenth of the annual income 33 edit rate supported libraries although by the mid 19th century england could claim 274 subscription libraries and scotland 266 the foundation of the modern public library system in the uk is the public libraries act 1850 prior to this the municipalities of warrington and salford established libraries in their museums under the terms of the museums act of 1845 warrington municipal library opened in 1848 salford museum and art gallery first opened in november 1850 as the royal museum amp public library as the first unconditionally free public library in england 43 44 the library in campfield manchester was the first library to operate a free lending library without subscription in 1852 45 norwich lays claims to being the first municipality to adopt the public libraries act 1850 which allowed any municipal borough with a population of 100 000 or more to introduce a halfpenny rate to establish public libraries although not to buy books citation needed but theirs was the eleventh library to open in 1857 being the eleventh in the country after winchester manchester liverpool bolton kidderminster cambridge birkenhead and sheffield citation needed the scottish american philanthropist and businessman andrew carnegie helped to increase the number of public libraries from the late 19th century 46 county libraries are a later development which were made possible by the establishment of county councils in 1888 they normally have a large central library in a major town with smaller branch libraries in other towns and a mobile library service covering rural areas edit north america edit canada in 1779 frederick haldimand the governor of qu bec city founded the first subscription library in canada until then canada s libraries were mostly religious institutions and the general public was not admitted however even though haldimand s library like other subscription libraries appealed primarily to an urban elite 47 it was the nation s first step towards the public library as it is known today haldimand s library later merged with the literary and historical society of quebec established in 1824 which displays the original qu bec library collection within its library this and similar association social libraries were examples of early prototypes of public libraries they were public in that membership was allowed regardless of class or religion and many in canada eventually evolved into free public libraries 48 subsequently legislative collections were established in 1791 in upper and in 1792 in lower canada 160 and in 1796 the first public library was founded in montreal in 1800 libraries were established in king s college nova scotia and at niagara where the first public library in upper canada operated for twenty years in spite of losses during the war of 1812 49 in saint john new brunswick in 1883 following the efforts of colonel james domville in procuring a collection of materials to replace the many private collections lost in the great fire of saint john new brunswick the first free tax supported public library was established guelph ontario and toronto ontario opened public libraries that same year as well 48 due to canada s size and diversity the development of the modern canadian public library was more of a slow evolution than a quick transition as each of the provinces specific conditions geographic economic cultural demographic etc had first to be addressed 48 the public library therefore took on many forms in canada s earlier years the three most prevalent of these forms were school district libraries mechanics institutes and association social libraries see reference to literary and historical society of quebec above 48 in 1850 school district libraries were initiated in canada public servant joseph howe started one in nova scotia and politician egerton ryerson started one in ontario new brunswick and prince edward island followed suit in 1858 and 1877 respectively the hope was that both children and adults could benefit from the local school authorities where financial assistance was provided from colonial legislatures but the departments of education proved to be too centralizing for locals and this practiced was phased out 50 mechanics institutes also contained libraries that the working class could access inexpensively the first canadian library of its kind was established in 1828 in montr al qu bec other communities took up this idea as well notably those in halifax nova scotia hamilton ontario toronto ontario and victoria british columbia like the school district libraries these institutes eventually ceased or were replaced by public libraries 51 the public library that opened in toronto ontario was mostly due to a campaign by city alderman john hallam james bain became the first chief librarian and built a comprehensive collection of canadian literature and history the toronto public library was one of the first libraries to choose free status and it was the largest of them all 52 its development flourished after 1900 when carnegie grants began to aid in building construction and the expansion of collections and services during this time open access and children s departments were introduced and standard cataloguing and classification systems were adopted 53 many of the original branches funded by a carnegie grant still stand and continue to be operated by the toronto public library 54 other provinces were affected by carnegie as well and followed ontario s lead in legislating tax support for library services british columbia acted in 1891 manitoba in 1899 saskatchewan in 1906 and in alberta the first legislation officially passed by the legislative assembly was the library act 55 the act was passed march 15 1907 56 57 the next provinces to follow were new brunswick in 1929 newfoundland in 1935 prince edward island in 1936 nova scotia in 1937 qu bec in1959 and then the northwest territories in 1966 52 as they stand today public libraries in canada are governed by provincial statues and are primarily financed by municipal tax revenues and other local income with provincial grants supplementing local funding they are also the responsibility of a local or regional library board with authority to appoint or dismiss employees control library property establish policies and budget for library operations 53 though the services offered vary from local branch to local branch public libraries in canada are not only places to read and borrow books they are also hubs of community services such as early reading programs computer access and tutoring and literacy help for children and adults 58 59 throughout the years canadian libraries have been subject to the political and economic influence of the nation during world war ii public libraries experienced development setbacks but expansion resumed in 1945 then in the 1960s canadian public libraries felt the benefits of the era s emphasis on education service expanded buildings were remodeled or constructed from scratch and centennial grants were provided in order to improve the system this period of growth ended in due to the inflationary period in the 1970s and the two recessions during the 1980s 53 however in the late 1990s this trend reversed and the national core library statistics program reported in 1999 that public libraries served 28 5 million municipal residents a total of 93 of the canadian population 60 nevertheless in 2011 the tides turned for public libraries in canada once again specifically in toronto the city is now undergoing a heated debate regarding mayor rob ford s proposed budget cuts for the toronto public library which is currently one of the most efficient public library systems in all of north america 61 edit mexico in 1646 don juan de palafox y mendoza bishop of puebla and viceroy of new spain expelled the jesuits from new spain and with the

called richardsonian romanesque as the united states developed from the 18th century to today growing more populous and wealthier factors such as a push for education and desire to share knowledge led to broad public support for free libraries in addition money donations by private philanthropists provided the seed capital to get many libraries started in some instances collectors donated vast book collections william james sidis in the tribes and the states claimed the public library as such was an american invention 63 but exactly what constitutes a free public library is subject to dispute and the term invention doesn t seem applicable to the many facets of an institution such as a library throughout history knowledge in different forms has been shared in different ways writing was recorded on papyrus and stored in scrolls and kept in vast libraries such as the library of alexandria in egypt in ancient greece knowledge was passed by one person reading aloud to a group of scribes from a text this resulted in sometimes different and error prone versions of the same text monks in the middle ages copied manuscripts by hand after the invention of the printing press by johann gutenberg books became prevalent and different institutions such as universities and governments and churches found ways to keep and share them there are disputes about which was the first public library in the nation early american cities such as boston and philadelphia and new york had the first organized collections of books but which library was truly public is subject to dispute sidis claims the first public library was boston s in 1636 63 although the official boston public library was organized later in 1852 64 in 1698 charleston s st philip s church parsonage had a parish library in 1731 benjamin franklin and his friends sometimes called the junto operated the library company of philadelphia partly as a means to settle arguments and partly as a means to advance themselves through sharing information franklin s subscription library allowed members to buy shares and combined funds were used to buy more books in return members could borrow books and use the library today the library company continues to exist as a nonprofit independent research library a town in massachusetts wanted to name itself franklin in honor of the famous pennsylvanian and in return benjamin franklin donated books for use by local residents while franklin had been asked to donate a church bell instead he declined on the basis that sense was preferable to sound 65 one source considers the franklin library in massachusetts to be the first public library in the united states 65 another source claims the library in darby pennsylvania which opened in 1743 is the oldest continuously operating free public library in the united states 66 but other libraries claim to be the first public library including the scoville library in salisbury connecticut which was established in 1803 67 the library in the new hampshire town of peterborough claims to be the first publicly funded library it opened in 1833 68 this library in peterborough nh the first tax based free public library was organized under the direct guidance of unitarian minister rev abiel abott 69 and a library in massachusetts in the town of arlington claims to have had the first free children

the largest book collections and the most funding the forerunner of the new york public library in manhattan was a library established by the earl of ballamont around 1700 72 a newspaper described the call for the first public librarian demanding that he must not be too young for this would render him liable to be despised by the youth and he must be of an even temper with great diligence and sufficient learning and have a genius peculiarly adapted to the calling 72 in 1849 the library was officially established and consolidated in 1901 today it is considered to be one of the most important public libraries in the nation 73 new york governor and book lover samuel j tilden bequeathed millions to build the new york public library he believed americans should have access to books and a free education if desired in 2005 the library offered the nypl digital gallery which made a collection of 275 000 images viewable over the web while most of the contents are in the public domain some images are still subject to copyright rules 74 in 1902 one account suggested the village library is growing more and more an indispensable adjunct to american village life 75 around the turn from the 19th to the 20th century scottish american businessman andrew carnegie donated over 60 million which was a vast fortune in 20th century dollars to build over 2 811 free public library buildings in the united states 76 they were often known as carnegie libraries 76 carnegie envisioned that libraries would bring books and information to all people 77 libraries have been started with wills from other benefactors for example the bacon free library in south natick massachusetts was founded in 1881 after a benefactor left 15 000 in a will it has operated as a public library since then 78 once the idea of the public library as an agency worthy of taxation was broadly established during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries librarians through actions of the american library association and its division devoted to public libraries the public library association sought ways to identify standards and guidelines to ensure quality service 79 legislation such as the library services act and the library services and construction act ensured that unserved areas and unserved groups would have access to library services 80 in 2009 with the economic downturn many public libraries have budget shortfalls the library in darby pennsylvania found expenses were greater than revenues from local property taxes state funds and investment income it was on the risk of closing according to a newspaper report 66 many public libraries face budgetary problems the report noted that tax dollars that support them are dwindling as property tax revenue declines along with home values and sales taxes fall as consumers spend less as local funding drops libraries are turning to their endowments and draining the investments 66 many libraries have foundations behind them to support them financially and rely on the help of well heeled donors as well as local corporations for funds 81 edit services most public libraries today are supported by tax monies from local and state governments and some have foundations to support them with additional capital libraries lend books and materials freely but charge fines if materials are returned late or damaged libraries often keep many historical documents relevant to their particular town and serve as a resource for historians in some instances for example the queens public library kept letters written by unrecognized tiffany lamp designer clara driscoll and the letters remained in the library until a curator discovered them 82 in 2009 big city libraries have multiple branches and offer numerous services for example the boston public library has 26 neighborhood branches and offers free internet service it has two restaurants and an online store which features reproductions of photographs and artwork and it promotes itself with a website 62 it answers more than one million reference questions annually 62 the library uses wireless technology software networks to offer more services and keep costs under control 62 the boston library offers digitized content video a wider range of formats and as a result research documents now have broader accessibility within the community and around the world and help communities by offering public access computers mobile wi fi access and free job search tools 62 libraries promote cultural awareness in newark new jersey the public library celebrated black history with exhibits and programs 83 libraries also partner with schools and community organizations to promote literacy and learning 77 one account suggested libraries were essential to economic competitiveness as well as neighborhood vitality and help some people find jobs 77 some library buildings are notable for their particular architectural styles in the town of beaver dam wisconsin architects designed the williams free library in the style of richardsonian romanesque edit europe this section requires expansion march 2010 edit france the national library of france is one of the oldest libraries in the world still in service today as it traces its origin to the royal library founded at the louvre by king charles v in 1368 but at the time it was conceived as the private
