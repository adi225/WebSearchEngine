language designed for managing data in relational database management systems rdbms originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus its scope includes data insert query update and delete schema creation and modification and data access control sql was one of the first commercial languages for edgar f codd s relational model as described in his influential 1970 paper a relational model of data for large shared data banks 4 despite not adhering to the relational model as described by codd it became the most widely used database language 5 6 although sql is often described as and to a great extent is a declarative language 4gl it also includes procedural elements sql became a standard of the american national standards institute ansi in 1986 and of the international organization for standards iso in 1987 since then the standard has been enhanced several times with added features however issues of sql code portability between major rdbms products still exist due to lack of full compliance with the standard and proprietary vendor extensions which lead to vendor lock in partly due to the large size and incomplete specification of the standard

this version initially called sequel structured english query language was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in ibm s original quasi relational database management system system r which a group at ibm san jose research laboratory had developed during the 1970s 7 the acronym sequel was later changed to sql because sequel was a trademark of the uk based hawker siddeley aircraft company 8 in the late 1970s relational software inc now oracle corporation saw the potential of the concepts described by codd chamberlin and boyce and developed their own sql based rdbms with aspirations of selling it to the u s navy central intelligence agency and other u s government agencies in june 1979 relational software inc introduced the first commercially available implementation of sql oracle v2 version2 for vax computers after testing sql at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system ibm began developing commercial products based on their system r prototype including system 38 sql ds and db2 which were commercially available in 1979 1981 and 1983 respectively 9 edit language elements this chart shows several of the sql language elements that compose a single statement the sql language is subdivided into several language elements including clauses which are constituent components of statements and queries in some cases these are optional 10 expressions which can produce either scalar values or tables consisting of columns and rows of data predicates which specify conditions that can be evaluated to sql three valued logic 3vl or boolean true false unknown truth values and which are used to limit the effects of statements and queries or to change program flow queries which retrieve the data based on specific criteria this is the most important element of sql statements which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data or which may control transactions program flow connections sessions or diagnostics sql statements also include the semicolon statement terminator though not required on every platform it is defined as a standard part of the sql grammar insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in sql statements and queries making it easier to format sql code for readability edit conditional case expressions sql has a case when then else end expression which was introduced in sql 92 in its most general form which is called a searched case in the sql standard it works like else if in other programming languages case when n gt 0 then positive when n lt 0 then negative else zero end the when conditions are tested in the order in which they appear in the source if no else expression is specified it defaults to else null an abbreviated syntax exists mirroring switch statements it is called simple case in the sql standard case n when 1 then one when 2 then two else i cannot count that high end this syntax uses implicit equality comparisons with the usual caveats for comparing with null for the oracle sql dialect the latter can be shortened to an equivalent decode construct select decode n 1 one 2 two i cannot count that high from some table the last value is the default if none is specified it also defaults to null however unlike the standard s simple case oracle s decode considers two null s to be equal with each other 11 edit queries the most common operation in sql is the query which is performed with the declarative select statement select retrieves data from one or more tables or expressions standard select statements have no persistent effects on the database some non standard implementations of select can have persistent effects such as the select into syntax that exists in some databases 12 queries allow the user to describe desired data leaving the database management system dbms responsible for planning optimizing and performing the physical operations necessary to produce that result as it chooses a query includes a list of columns to be included in the final result immediately following the select keyword an asterisk can also be used to specify that the query should return all columns of the queried tables select is the most complex statement in sql with optional keywords and clauses that include the from clause which indicates the table s from which data is to be retrieved the from clause can include optional join subclauses to specify the rules for joining tables the where clause includes a comparison predicate which restricts the rows returned by the query the where clause eliminates all rows from the result set for which the comparison predicate does not evaluate to true the group by clause is used to project rows having common values into a smaller set of rows group by is often used in conjunction with sql aggregation functions or to eliminate duplicate rows from a result set the where clause is applied before the group by clause the having clause includes a predicate used to filter rows resulting from the group by clause because it acts on the results of the group by clause aggregation functions can be used in the having clause predicate the order by clause identifies which columns are used to sort the resulting data and in which direction they should be sorted options are ascending or descending without an order by clause the order of rows returned by an sql query is undefined the following is an example of a select query that returns a list of expensive books the query retrieves all rows from the book table in which the price column contains a value greater than 100 00 the result is sorted in ascending order by title the asterisk in the select list indicates that all columns of the book table should be included in the result set select from book where price gt 100 00 order by title the example below demonstrates a query of multiple tables grouping and aggregation by returning a list of books and the number of authors associated with each book select book title as title count as authors from book join book author on book isbn book author isbn group by book title example output might resemble the following title authors sql examples and guide 4 the joy of sql 1 an introduction to sql 2 pitfalls of sql 1 under the precondition that isbn is the only common column name of the two tables and that a column named title only exists in the books table the above query could be rewritten in the following form select title count as authors from book natural join book author group by title however many vendors either do not support this approach or require certain column naming conventions in order for natural joins to work effectively sql includes operators and functions for calculating values on stored values sql allows the use of expressions in the select list to project data as in the following example which returns a list of books that cost more than 100 00 with an additional sales tax column containing a sales tax figure calculated at 6 of the price select isbn title price price 0 06 as sales tax from book where price gt 100 00 order by title edit subqueries queries can be nested so that the results of one query can be used in another query via a relational operator or aggregation function a nested query is also known as a subquery while joins and other table operations provide computationally superior i e faster alternatives in many cases the use of subqueries introduces a hierarchy in execution which can be useful or necessary in the following example the aggregation function avg receives as input the result of a subquery select isbn title price from book where price lt avg select price from book order by title since 1999 the sql standard allows named subqueries called common table expression named and designed after the ibm db2 version 2 implementation oracle calls these subquery factoring ctes can be also be recursive by referring to themselves the resulting mechanism allows tree or graph traversals when represented as relations and more generally fixpoint computations edit null and three valued logic 3vl main article null sql the concept of null was introduced into sql to handle missing information in the relational model the word null is a reserved keyword in sql used to identify the null special marker comparisons with null for instance equality in where clauses results in an unknown truth value in select statements sql returns only results for which the where clause returns a value of true i e it excludes results with values of false and also excludes those whose value is unknown along with true and false the unknown resulting from direct comparisons with null thus brings a fragment of three valued logic to sql the truth tables sql uses for and or and not correspond to a common fragment of the kleene and lukasiewicz three valued logic which differ in their definition of implication however sql defines no such operation 13 p and q p true false unknown q true true false unknown false false false false unknown unknown false unknown p or q p true false unknown q true true true true false true false unknown unknown true unknown unknown q not q true false false true unknown unknown p q p true false unknown q true true false unknown false false true unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown there are however disputes about the semantic interpretation of nulls in sql because of its treatment outside direct comparisons as seen in the table above direct equality comparisons between two nulls in sql e g null null returns a truth value of unknown this is in line with the interpretation that null does not have a value and is not a member of any data domain but is rather a placeholder or mark for missing information however the principle that two nulls aren t equal to each other is effectively violated in the sql specification for the union and intersect operators which do identify nulls with each other 14 consequently these set operations in sql may produce results not representing sure information unlike operations involving explicit comparisons with null e g those in a where clause discussed above in codd s 1979 proposal which was basically adopted by sql92 this semantic inconsistency is rationalized by arguing that removal of duplicates in set operations happens at a lower level of detail than equality testing in the evaluation of retrieval operations 13 however computer science professor ron van der meyden concluded that the inconsistencies in the sql standard mean that it is not possible to ascribe any intuitive logical semantics to the treatment of nulls in sql 14 additionally since sql operators return unknown when comparing anything with null directly sql provides two null specific comparison predicates is null and is not null test whether data is or is not null 15 universal quantification is not explicitly supported by sql and must be worked out as a negated existential quantification 16 17 18 there is also the lt row value expression gt is distinct from lt row value expression gt infixed comparison operator which returns true unless both operands are equal or both are null likewise is not distinct from is defined as not lt row value expression gt is distinct from lt row value expression gt sql 1999 also introduced boolean type variables which according to the standard can also hold unknown values in practice a number of systems e g postgresql implement the boolean unknown as a boolean null edit data manipulation the data manipulation language dml is the subset of sql used to add update and delete data insert adds rows formally tuples to an existing table e g insert into my table field1 field2 field3 values test n null update modifies a set of existing table rows e g update my table set field1 updated value where field2 n delete removes existing rows from a table e g delete from my table where field2 n merge is used to combine the data of multiple tables it combines the insert and update elements it is defined in the sql 2003 standard prior to that some databases provided similar functionality via different syntax sometimes called upsert merge into table name using table reference on condition when matched then update set column1 value1 column2 value2 when not matched then insert column1 column2 values value1 value2 edit transaction controls transactions if available wrap dml operations start transaction or begin work or begin transaction depending on sql dialect marks the start of a database transaction which either completes entirely or not at all save transaction or savepoint saves the state of the database at the current point in transaction create table tbl 1 id int insert into tbl 1 id values 1 insert into tbl 1 id values 2 commit update tbl 1 set id 200 where id 1 savepoint id 1upd update tbl 1 set id 1000 where id 2 rollback to id 1upd select id from tbl 1 commit causes all data changes in a transaction to be made permanent rollback causes all data changes since the last commit or rollback to be discarded leaving the state of the data as it was prior to those changes once the commit statement completes the transaction s changes cannot be rolled back commit and rollback terminate the current transaction and release data locks in the absence of a start transaction or similar statement the semantics of sql are implementation dependent the following example shows a classic transfer of funds transaction where money is removed from one account and added to another if either the removal or the addition fails the entire transaction is rolled back start transaction update account set amount amount 200 where account number 1234 update account set amount amount 200 where account number 2345 if errors 0 commit if errors lt gt 0 rollback edit data definition the data definition language ddl manages table and index structure the most basic items of ddl are the create alter rename drop and truncate statements create creates an object a table for example in the database e g create table my table my field1 int my field2 varchar 50 my field3 date not null primary key my field1 my field2 alter modifies the structure of an existing object in various ways for example adding a column to an existing table or a constraint e g alter table my table add my field4 number 3 not null truncate deletes all data from a table in a very fast way deleting the data inside the table and not the table itself it usually implies a subsequent commit operation i e it cannot be rolled back data is not written to the logs for rollback later unlike delete truncate table my table drop deletes an object in the database usually irretrievably i e it cannot be rolled back e g drop table my table edit data types each column in an sql table declares the type s that column may contain ansi sql includes the following data types 19 edit character strings character n or char n fixed width n character string padded with spaces as needed character varying n or varchar n variable width string with a maximum size of n characters national character n or nchar n fixed width string supporting an international character set national character varying n or nvarchar n variable width nchar string edit bit strings bit n an array of n bits bit varying n an array of up to n bits edit numbers integer and smallint float real and double precision numeric precision scale or decimal precision scale for example the number 123 45 has a precision of 5 and a scale of 2 the precision is a positive integer that determines the number of significant digits in a particular radix binary or decimal the scale is a non negative integer a scale of 0 indicates that the number is an integer for a decimal number with scale s the exact numeric value is the integer value of the significant digits divided by 10 s sql provides a function to round numerics or dates called trunc in informix db2 postgresql oracle and mysql or round in informix sybase oracle postgresql and microsoft sql server 20 edit date and time date for date values e g 2011 05 03 time for time values e g 15 51 36 the granularity of the time value is usually a tick 100 nanoseconds time with time zone or timetz 160 the same as time but including details about the time zone in question timestamp this is a date and a time put together in one variable e g 2011 05 03 15 51 36 timestamp with time zone or timestamptz the same as timestamp but including details about the time zone in question sql provides several functions for generating a date time variable out of a date time string to date to time to timestamp as well as for extracting the respective members seconds for instance of such variables the current system date time of the database server can be called by using functions like now edit data control the data control language dcl authorizes users to access and manipulate data its two main statements are grant authorizes one or more users to perform an operation or a set of operations on an object revoke eliminates a grant which may be the default grant example grant select update on my table to some user another user revoke select update on my table from some user another user edit procedural extensions sql is designed for a specific purpose to query data contained in a relational database sql is a set based declarative query language not an imperative language like c or basic however there are extensions to standard sql which add procedural programming language functionality such as control of flow constructs these include source common name full name ansi iso standard sql psm sql persistent stored modules interbase firebird psql procedural sql ibm db2 sql pl sql procedural language implements sql psm ibm informix spl stored procedural language microsoft sybase t sql transact sql mimer sql sql psm sql persistent stored module implements sql psm mysql sql psm sql persistent stored module implements sql psm oracle pl sql procedural language sql based on ada postgresql pl pgsql procedural language postgresql structured query language based on oracle pl sql postgresql pl psm procedural language persistent stored modules implements sql psm sybase watcom sql sql anywhere watcom structured query language dialect teradata spl stored procedural language in addition to the standard sql psm extensions and proprietary sql extensions procedural and object oriented programmability is available on many sql platforms via dbms integration with other languages the sql standard defines sql jrt extensions sql routines and types for the java programming language to support java code in sql databases sql server 2005 uses the sqlclr sql server common language runtime to host managed net assemblies in the database while prior versions of sql server were restricted to using unmanaged extended stored procedures that were primarily written in c postgresql allows functions to be written in a wide variety of languages including perl python tcl and c 21 edit sql operators operator description equal lt gt or 160 not equal gt greater than lt less than gt greater than or equal lt less than or equal between between an inclusive range like search for a pattern in to specify multiple possible values for a column edit criticism sql deviates in several ways from its theoretical foundation the relational model and its tuple calculus in that model a table is a set of tuples while in sql tables and query results are lists of rows the same row may occur multiple times and the order of rows can be employed in queries e g in the limit clause furthermore additional features such as null and views were introduced without founding them directly on the relational model which makes them more difficult to interpret critics argue that sql should be replaced with a language that strictly returns to the original foundation for example see the third manifesto other critics suggest that datalog has two advantages over sql it has a cleaner semantics which facilitates program understanding and maintenance and it is more expressive in particular for recursive queries 22 edit cross vendor portability another criticism is that sql implementations are incompatible between vendors in particular date and time syntax string concatenation null s and comparison case sensitivity vary from vendor to vendor a particular exception is postgresql which strives for compliance 23 popular implementations of sql commonly omit support for basic features of standard sql such as the date or time data types the most obvious such examples and incidentally the most popular commercial and proprietary sql dbmss are oracle whose date behaves as datetime 24 25 and lacks a time type 26 and ms sql server before the 2008 version as a result sql code can rarely be ported between database systems without modifications there are several reasons for this lack of portability between database systems the complexity and size of the sql standard means that most implementors do not support the entire standard the standard does not specify database behavior in several important areas e g indexes file storage leaving implementations to decide how to behave the sql standard precisely specifies the syntax that a conforming database system must implement however the standard s specification of the semantics of language constructs is less well defined leading to ambiguity many database vendors have large existing customer bases where the sql standard conflicts with the prior behavior of the vendor s database the vendor may be unwilling to break backward compatibility software vendors often desire to create incompatibilities with other products as it provides a strong incentive for their existing users to remain loyal see vendor lock in citation needed edit standardization sql was adopted as a standard by the american national standards institute ansi in 1986 as sql 86 27 and the international organization for standardization iso in 1987 nowadays the standard is subject to continuous improvement by the joint technical committee iso iec jtc 1 information technology subcommittee sc 32 data management and interchange which affiliate to iso as well as iec it is commonly denoted by the pattern iso iec 9075 n yyyy part n title or as a shortcut iso iec 9075 iso iec 9075 is complemented by iso iec 13249 sql multimedia and application packages sql mm which defines sql based interfaces and packages to widely spread applications like video audio and spatial data until 1996 the national institute of standards and technology nist data management standards program certified sql dbms compliance with the sql standard vendors now self certify the compliance of their products 28 the original sql standard declared that the official pronunciation for sql is es queue el 5 many english speaking database professionals still use the original 29 pronunciation si kw l like the word sequel including donald chamberlin himself 30 the sql standard has gone through a number of revisions as shown below year name alias comments 1986 sql 86 sql 87 first formalized by ansi 1989 sql 89 fips 127 1 minor revision in which the major addition

manipulating it within the database and publishing both xml and conventional sql data in xml form in addition it enables applications to integrate into their sql code the use of xquery the xml query language published by the world wide web consortium w3c to concurrently access ordinary sql data and xml documents 31 2008 sql 2008 sql 2008 legalizes order by outside cursor definitions adds instead
