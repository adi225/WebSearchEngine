microsoft began its foray into the olap server business by acquiring the olap software technology from israel based panorama software 1 just over two years later in 1998 microsoft released olap services as part of sql server 7 olap services supported molap rolap and holap architectures and it used ole db for olap as the client access api and mdx as a query language it could work in client server mode or offline mode with local cube files 2 in 2000 microsoft released analysis services 2000 it was renamed from olap services due to the inclusion of data mining services analysis services 2000 was considered an evolutionary release since it was built on the same architecture as olap services and was therefore backward compatible with it major improvements included more flexibility in dimension design through support of parent child dimensions changing dimensions and virtual dimensions another feature was a greatly enhanced calculation engine with support for unary operators custom rollups and cell calculations other features were dimension security distinct count connectivity over http session cubes grouping levels and many others 3 in 2005 microsoft released the next generation of olap and data mining technology as analysis services 2005 it maintained backward compatibility on the api level although applications written with ole db for olap and mdx continued to work the architecture of the product was completely different the major change came to the model in the form of udm unified dimensional model 4 clarification needed edit timeline the key events in the

arguments among olap products it allows all the flavors of molap rolap and holap to be used within the same model edit partition storage modes molap multidimensional olap both fact data and aggregations are processed stored and indexed using a special format optimized for multidimensional data rolap relational olap both fact data and aggregations remain in the relational data source eliminating the need for special processing holap hybrid olap this mode uses the relational data source to store the fact data but pre processes aggregations and indexes storing these in a special format optimized for multidimensional data edit dimension storage modes molap dimension attributes and hierarchies are processed and stored in the special format rolap dimension attributes are not processed and remain in the relational data source edit apis and object models microsoft analysis services supports different sets of apis and object models for different operations and in different programming environments edit querying xml for analysis the lowest level api it can be used from any platform and in any language that supports http and xml ole db for olap extension of oledb com
