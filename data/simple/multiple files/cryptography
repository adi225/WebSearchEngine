war 160 ii to encrypt very high level general staff messages cryptography or cryptology from greek hidden secret and graphein writing or logia study respectively 1 is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries 2 more generally it is about constructing and analyzing protocols that overcome the influence of adversaries 3 and which are related to various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality data integrity authentication and non repudiation 4 modern cryptography intersects the disciplines of mathematics computer science and electrical engineering applications of cryptography include atm cards computer passwords and electronic commerce cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption the conversion of information from a readable state to apparent nonsense the originator of an encrypted message shared the decoding technique needed to recover the original information only with intended recipients thereby precluding unwanted persons to do the same since world war 160 i and the advent of the computer the methods used to carry out cryptology have become increasingly complex and its application more widespread modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions making such algorithms hard to break in practice by any adversary it is theoretically possible to break such a system but it is infeasible to do so by any known practical means these schemes are therefore termed computationally secure theoretical advances e g improvements in integer factorization algorithms and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted there exist information theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power an example is the one time pad but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms cryptology related technology has raised a number of legal issues in the united kingdom additions to the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 require a suspected criminal to hand over their encryption key if asked by law enforcement otherwise the user will face a criminal charge 5 the electronic frontier foundation eff is involved in a case in the supreme court of the united states which may determine whether requiring suspected criminals to provide their encryption keys to law enforcement is unconstitutional the eff is arguing that this is a violation of the right of not being forced to incriminate oneself as given in the fifth amendment 6 contents 1 terminology

links edit terminology until modern times cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption which is the process of converting ordinary information called plaintext into unintelligible gibberish called ciphertext 7 decryption is the reverse in other words moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext a cipher or cypher is a pair of algorithms that create the encryption and the reversing decryption the detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and in each instance by a key this is a secret ideally known only to the communicants usually a short string of characters which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext a cryptosystem is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts finite possible cyphertexts finite possible keys and the encryption and decryption algorithms which correspond to each key keys are important as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless or even counter productive for most purposes historically ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as authentication or integrity checks in colloquial use the term code is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning however in cryptography code has a more specific meaning it means the replacement of a unit of plaintext i e a meaningful word or phrase with a code word for example wallaby replaces attack at dawn codes are no longer used in serious cryptography except incidentally for such things as unit designations e g bronco flight or operation overlord since properly chosen ciphers are both more practical and more secure than even the best codes and also are better adapted to computers cryptanalysis is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so i e it is the study of how to crack encryption algorithms or their implementations some use the terms cryptography and cryptology interchangeably in english while others including us military practice generally use cryptography to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and cryptology to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis 8 9 english is more flexible than several other languages in which cryptology done by cryptologists is always used in the second sense above in the english wikipedia the general term used for the entire field is cryptography done by cryptographers the study of characteristics of languages which have some application in cryptography or cryptology i e frequency data letter combinations universal patterns etc is called cryptolinguistics edit history of cryptography and cryptanalysis main article history of cryptography before the modern era cryptography was concerned solely with message confidentiality i e encryption conversion of messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge namely the key needed for decryption of that message encryption was used to attempt to ensure secrecy in communications such as those of spies military leaders and diplomats in recent decades the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking sender receiver identity authentication digital signatures interactive proofs and secure computation among others edit classic cryptography reconstructed ancient greek scytale rhymes with italy an early cipher device the earliest forms of secret writing required little more than local pen and paper analogs as most people could not read more literacy or literate opponents required actual cryptography the main classical cipher types are transposition ciphers which rearrange the order of letters in a message e g hello world becomes ehlol owrdl in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme and substitution ciphers which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters e g fly at once becomes gmz bu podf by replacing each letter with the one following it in the latin alphabet simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents an early substitution cipher was the caesar cipher in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet suetonius reports that julius caesar used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals atbash is an example of an early hebrew cipher the earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in egypt ca 1900 bce but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information cryptography is recommended in the kama sutra ca 400 bce as a way for lovers to communicate without inconvenient discovery 10 the greeks of classical times are said to have known of ciphers e g the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the spartan military 11 steganography i e hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential was also first developed in ancient times an early example from herodotus concealed a message a tattoo on a slave s shaved head under the regrown hair 7 another greek method was developed by polybius now called the polybius square 12 more modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink microdots and digital watermarks to conceal information ciphertexts produced by a classical cipher and some modern ciphers always reveal statistical information about the plaintext which can often be used to break them after the discovery of frequency analysis perhaps by the arab mathematician and polymath al kindi also known as alkindus in the 9th century citation needed nearly all such ciphers became more or less readily breakable by any informed attacker such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today though mostly as puzzles see cryptogram al kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled risalah fi istikhraj al mu amma manuscript for the deciphering cryptographic messages which described the first cryptanalysis techniques 13 14 16th century book shaped french cipher machine with arms of henri ii of france enciphered letter from gabriel de luetz d aramon french ambassador to the ottoman empire after 1546 with partial decipherment essentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher most clearly by leon battista alberti around the year 1467 though there is some indication that it was already known to al kindi 14 alberti s innovation was to use different ciphers i e substitution alphabets for various parts of a message perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit he also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device a wheel which implemented a partial realization of his invention in the polyalphabetic vigen re cipher encryption uses a key word which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used in the mid 19th century charles babbage showed that the vigen re cipher was vulnerable to kasiski examination but this was first published about ten years later by friedrich kasiski 15 although frequency analysis is a powerful and general technique against many ciphers encryption has still often been effective in practice as many a would be cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique breaking a message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved thus making espionage bribery burglary defection etc more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed it was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher s algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security in fact it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme including ciphers should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack this fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by auguste kerckhoffs and is generally called kerckhoffs s principle alternatively and more bluntly it was restated by claude shannon the inventor of information theory and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography as shannon s maxim the enemy knows the system different physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers one of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient greece a rod supposedly used by the spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher see image above in medieval times other aids were invented such as the cipher grille which was also used for a kind of steganography with the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as alberti s own cipher disk johannes trithemius tabula recta scheme and thomas jefferson s multi cylinder not publicly known and reinvented independently by bazeries around 1900 many mechanical encryption decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century and several patented among them rotor machines famously including the enigma machine used by the german government and military from the late 20s and during world war ii 16 the ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after wwi 17 edit computer era cryptanalysis of the new mechanical devices proved to be both difficult and laborious in the united kingdom cryptanalytic efforts at bletchley park during wwii spurred the development of more efficient means for carrying out repetitious tasks this culminated in the development of the colossus the world s first fully electronic digital programmable computer which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the german army s lorenz sz40 42 machine just as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis it made possible much more complex ciphers furthermore computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts this was new and significant computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography both for cipher design and cryptanalysis many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequences sometimes in groups or blocks unlike classical and mechanical schemes which generally manipulate traditional characters i e letters and digits directly however computers have also assisted cryptanalysis which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity nonetheless good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient i e fast and requiring few resources such as memory or cpu capability while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible credit card with smart card capabilities the 3 by 5 mm chip embedded in the card is shown enlarged smart cards combine low cost and portability with the power to compute cryptographic algorithms extensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent it began only in the mid 1970s in recent times ibm personnel designed the algorithm that became the federal i e us data encryption standard whitfield diffie and martin hellman published their key agreement algorithm 18 and the rsa algorithm was published in martin gardner s scientific american column since then cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications computer networks and computer security generally some modern cryptographic techniques can only keep their keys secret if certain mathematical problems are intractable such as the integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problems so there are deep connections with abstract mathematics there are no absolute proofs that a cryptographic technique is secure but see one time pad at best there are proofs that some techniques are secure if some computational problem is difficult to solve or this or that assumption about implementation or practical use is met as well as being aware of cryptographic history cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs for instance continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of brute force attacks thus when specifying key lengths the required key lengths are similarly advancing 19 the potential effects of quantum computing are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers the announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for this preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative 4 essentially prior to the early 20th century cryptography was chiefly concerned with linguistic and lexicographic patterns since then the emphasis has shifted and cryptography now makes extensive use of mathematics including aspects of information theory computational complexity statistics combinatorics abstract algebra number theory and finite mathematics generally cryptography is also a branch of engineering but an unusual one as it deals with active intelligent and malevolent opposition see cryptographic engineering and security engineering other kinds of engineering e g civil or chemical engineering need deal only with neutral natural forces there is also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and quantum physics see quantum cryptography and quantum computer edit modern cryptography the modern field of cryptography can be divided into several areas of study the chief ones are discussed here see topics in cryptography for more edit symmetric key cryptography main article symmetric key algorithm symmetric key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key or less commonly in which their keys are different but related in an easily computable way this was the only kind of encryption publicly known until june 1976 18 one round out of 8 5 of the patented idea cipher used in some versions of pgp for high speed encryption of for instance e mail symmetric key ciphers are implemented as either block ciphers or stream ciphers a block cipher enciphers input in blocks of plaintext as opposed to individual characters the input form used by a stream cipher the data encryption standard des and the advanced encryption standard aes are block cipher designs which have been designated cryptography standards by the us government though des s designation was finally withdrawn after the aes was adopted 20 despite its deprecation as an official standard des especially its still approved and much more secure triple des variant remains quite popular it is used across a wide range of applications from atm encryption 21 to e mail privacy 22 and secure remote access 23 many other block ciphers have been designed and released with considerable variation in quality many have been thoroughly broken such as feal 4 24 stream ciphers in contrast to the block type create an arbitrarily long stream of key material which is combined with the plaintext bit by bit or character by character somewhat like the one time pad in a stream cipher the output stream is created based on a hidden internal state which changes as the cipher operates that internal state is initially set up using the secret key material rc4 is a widely used stream cipher see category stream ciphers 4 block ciphers can be used as stream ciphers see block cipher modes of operation cryptographic hash functions are a third type of cryptographic algorithm they take a message of any length as input and output a short fixed length hash which can be used in for example a digital signature for good hash functions an attacker cannot find two messages that produce the same hash md4 is a long used hash function which is now broken md5 a strengthened variant of md4 is also widely used but broken in practice the u s national security agency developed the secure hash algorithm series of md5 like hash functions sha 0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew sha 1 is widely deployed and more secure than md5 but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it the sha 2 family improves on sha 1 but it isn t yet widely deployed and the u s standards authority thought it prudent from a security perspective to develop a new standard to significantly improve the robustness of nist s overall hash algorithm toolkit 25 thus a hash function design competition was meant to select a new u s national standard to be called sha 3 by 2012 the competition ended on october 2 2012 when the nist announced that keccak would be the new sha 3 hash algorithm 26 message authentication codes macs are much like cryptographic hash functions except that a secret key can be used to authenticate the hash value 4 upon receipt edit public key cryptography main article public key cryptography symmetric key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message though a message or group of messages may have a different key than others a significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely each distinct pair of communicating parties must ideally share a different key and perhaps each ciphertext exchanged as well the number of keys required increases as the square of the number of network members which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all straight and secret the difficulty of securely establishing a secret key between two communicating parties when a secure channel does not already exist between them also presents a chicken and egg problem which is a considerable practical obstacle for cryptography users in the real world whitfield diffie and martin hellman authors of the first published paper on public key cryptography in a groundbreaking 1976 paper whitfield diffie and martin hellman proposed the notion of public key also more generally called asymmetric key cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used a public key and a private key 27 a public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key the private key is computationally infeasible from the other the public key even though they are necessarily related instead both keys are generated secretly as an interrelated pair 28 the historian david kahn described public key cryptography as the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic substitution emerged in the renaissance 29 in public key cryptosystems the public key may be freely distributed while its paired private key must remain secret in a public key encryption system the public key is used for encryption while the private or secret key is used for decryption while diffie and hellman could not find such a system they showed that public key cryptography was indeed possible by presenting the diffie hellman key exchange protocol a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties to secretly agree on a shared encryption key 18 diffie and hellman s publication sparked widespread academic efforts in finding a practical public key encryption system this race was finally won in 1978 by ronald rivest adi shamir and len adleman whose solution has since become known as the rsa algorithm 30 the diffie hellman and rsa algorithms in addition to being the first publicly known examples of high quality public key algorithms have been among the most widely used others include the cramer shoup cryptosystem elgamal encryption and various elliptic curve techniques see category asymmetric key cryptosystems to much surprise a document published in 1997 by the government communications headquarters gchq a british intelligence organization revealed that cryptographers at gchq had anticipated several academic developments 31 reportedly around 1970 james h ellis had conceived the principles of asymmetric key cryptography in 1973 clifford cocks invented a solution that essentially resembles the rsa algorithm 31 32 and in 1974 malcolm j williamson is claimed to have developed the diffie hellman key exchange 33 padlock icon from the firefox web browser meant to indicate a page has been sent in ssl or tls encrypted protected form however seeing an icon results when code is intended to render it malicious code can provide the icon even when the connection is not actually being protected by ssl or tls citation needed public key cryptography can also be used for implementing digital signature schemes a digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary signature they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce but difficult for anyone else to forge digital signatures can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed they cannot then be moved from one document to another for any attempt will be detectable in digital signature schemes there are two algorithms one for signing in which a secret key is used to process the message or a hash of the message or both and one for verification in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature rsa and dsa are two of the most popular digital signature schemes digital signatures are central to the operation of public key infrastructures and many network security schemes e g ssl tls many vpns etc 24 public key algorithms are most often based on the computational complexity of hard problems often from number theory for example the hardness of rsa is related to the integer factorization problem while diffie hellman and dsa are related to the discrete logarithm problem more recently elliptic curve cryptography has developed in which security is based on number theoretic problems involving elliptic curves because of the difficulty of the underlying problems most public key algorithms involve operations such as modular multiplication and exponentiation which are much more computationally expensive than the techniques used in most block ciphers especially with typical key sizes as a result public key cryptosystems are commonly hybrid cryptosystems in which a fast high quality symmetric key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message but encrypted using a public key algorithm similarly hybrid signature schemes are often used in which a cryptographic hash function is computed and only the resulting hash is digitally signed 4 edit cryptanalysis main article cryptanalysis variants of the enigma machine used by germany s military and civil authorities from the late 1920s through world war ii implemented a complex electro mechanical polyalphabetic cipher breaking and reading of the enigma cipher at poland s cipher bureau for 7 years before the war and subsequent decryption at bletchley park was important to allied victory 7 the goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme thus permitting its subversion or evasion it is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken in connection with his wwii work at bell labs claude shannon proved that the one time pad cipher is unbreakable provided the key material is truly random never reused kept secret from all possible attackers and of equal or greater length than the message 34 most ciphers apart from the one time pad can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force attack but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size as compared to the effort needed to make use of the cipher in such cases effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required i e work factor in shannon s terms is beyond the ability of any adversary this means it must be shown that no efficient method as opposed to the time consuming brute force method can be found to break the cipher since no such proof has been found to date the one time pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher there are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks and they can be classified in any of several ways a common distinction turns on what an attacker knows and what capabilities are available in a ciphertext only attack the cryptanalyst has access only to the ciphertext good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively immune to ciphertext only attacks in a known plaintext attack the cryptanalyst has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext or to many such pairs in a chosen plaintext attack the cryptanalyst may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding ciphertext perhaps many times an example is gardening used by the british during wwii finally in a chosen ciphertext attack the cryptanalyst may be able to choose ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts 4 also important often overwhelmingly so are mistakes generally in the design or use of one of the protocols involved see cryptanalysis of the enigma for some historical examples of this pozna monument center to polish cryptologists whose breaking of germany s enigma machine ciphers beginning in 1932 altered the course of world war ii cryptanalysis of symmetric key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher for example a simple brute force attack against des requires one known plaintext and 2 55 decryptions trying approximately half of the possible keys to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found but this may not be enough assurance a linear cryptanalysis attack against des requires 2 43 known plaintexts and approximately 2 43 des operations 35 this is a considerable improvement on brute force attacks public key algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems the most famous of these is integer factorization e g the rsa algorithm is based on a problem related to integer factoring but the discrete logarithm problem is also important much public key cryptanalysis concerns numerical algorithms for solving these computational problems or some of them efficiently i e in a practical time for instance the best known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve based version of discrete logarithm are much more time consuming than the best known algorithms for factoring at least for problems of more or less equivalent size thus other things being equal to achieve an equivalent strength of attack resistance factoring based encryption techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques for this reason public key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid 1990s while pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves other attacks on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices and are called side channel attacks if a cryptanalyst has access to for example the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or pin character he may be able to use a timing attack to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis an attacker might also study the pattern and length of messages to derive valuable information this is known as traffic analysis 36 and can be quite useful to an alert adversary poor administration of a cryptosystem such as permitting too short keys will make any system vulnerable regardless of other virtues and of course social engineering and other attacks against the personnel who work with cryptosystems or the messages they handle e g bribery extortion blackmail espionage torture may be the most productive attacks of all edit cryptographic primitives much of the theoretical work in cryptography concerns cryptographic primitives algorithms with basic cryptographic properties and their relationship to other cryptographic problems more complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic primitives these primitives provide fundamental properties which are used to develop more complex tools called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocols which guarantee one or more high level security properties note however that the distinction between cryptographic primitives and cryptosystems is quite arbitrary for example the rsa algorithm is sometimes considered a cryptosystem and sometimes a primitive typical examples of cryptographic primitives include pseudorandom functions one way functions etc edit cryptosystems one or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm called a cryptographic system or cryptosystem cryptosystems e g el gamal encryption are designed to provide particular functionality e g public key encryption while guaranteeing certain security properties e g chosen plaintext attack cpa security in the random oracle model cryptosystems use the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support the system s security properties of course as the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems in many cases the cryptosystem s structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space e g between the sender of a secure message and its receiver or across time e g cryptographically protected backup data such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocols some widely known cryptosystems include rsa encryption schnorr signature el gamal encryption pgp etc more complex cryptosystems include electronic cash 37 systems signcryption systems etc some more theoretical cryptosystems include interactive proof systems 38 like zero knowledge proofs 39 systems for secret sharing 40 41 etc until recently timeframe most security properties of most cryptosystems were demonstrated using empirical techniques or using ad hoc reasoning recently timeframe there has been considerable effort to develop formal techniques for establishing the security of cryptosystems this has been generally called provable security the general idea of provable security is to give arguments about the computational difficulty needed to compromise some security aspect of the cryptosystem i e to any adversary the study of how best to implement and integrate cryptography in software applications is itself a distinct field see cryptographic engineering and security engineering edit legal issues see also cryptography laws in different nations edit prohibitions cryptography has long been of interest to intelligence gathering and law enforcement agencies secret communications may be criminal or even treasonous because of its facilitation of privacy and the diminution of privacy attendant on its prohibition cryptography is also of considerable interest to civil rights supporters accordingly there has been a history of controversial legal issues surrounding cryptography especially since the advent of inexpensive computers has made widespread access to high quality cryptography possible in some countries even the domestic use of cryptography is or has been restricted until 1999 france significantly restricted the use of cryptography domestically though it has since relaxed many of these rules in china a license is still required to use cryptography many countries have tight restrictions on the use of cryptography among the more restrictive are laws in belarus kazakhstan mongolia pakistan singapore tunisia and vietnam 42 in the united states cryptography is legal for domestic use but there has been much conflict over legal issues related to cryptography one particularly important issue has been the export of cryptography and cryptographic software and hardware probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in world war ii and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for national security many western governments have at some point strictly regulated export of cryptography after world war ii it was illegal in the us to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas in fact encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the united states munitions list 43 until the development of the personal computer asymmetric key algorithms i e public key techniques and the internet this was not especially problematic however as the internet grew and computers became more widely available high quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe as a result export controls came to be seen to be an impediment to commerce and to research edit export controls main article export of cryptography in the 1990s there were several challenges to us export regulations of cryptography one involved philip zimmermann s pretty good privacy pgp encryption program it was released in the us together with its source code and found its way onto the internet in june 1991 after a complaint by rsa security then called rsa data security inc or rsadsi zimmermann was criminally investigated by the customs service and the fbi for several years no charges were ever filed however 44 45 also daniel j bernstein then a graduate student at uc berkeley brought a lawsuit against the us government challenging some aspects of the restrictions based on free speech grounds the 1995 case bernstein v united states ultimately resulted in a 1999 decision that printed source code for cryptographic algorithms and systems was protected as free speech by the united states constitution 46 in 1996 thirty nine countries signed the wassenaar arrangement an arms control treaty that deals with the export of arms and dual use technologies such as cryptography the treaty stipulated that the use of cryptography with short key lengths 56 bit for symmetric encryption 512 bit for rsa would no longer be export controlled 47 cryptography exports from the us are now much less strictly regulated than in the past as a consequence of a major relaxation in 2000 42 there are no longer very many restrictions on key sizes in us exported mass market software in practice today since the relaxation in us export restrictions and because almost every personal computer connected to the internet everywhere in the world includes us sourced web browsers such as firefox or internet explorer almost every internet user worldwide has access to quality cryptography i e when using sufficiently long keys with properly operating and unsubverted software etc in their browsers examples are transport layer security or ssl stack the mozilla thunderbird and microsoft outlook e mail client programs similarly can connect to imap or pop servers via tls and can send and receive email encrypted with s mime many internet users don t realize that their basic application software contains such extensive cryptosystems these browsers and email programs are so ubiquitous that even governments whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally don t find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality so even when such laws are in force actual enforcement is often effectively impossible edit nsa involvement see also clipper chip another contentious issue connected to cryptography in the united states is the influence of the national security agency on cipher development and policy the nsa was involved with the design of des during its development at ibm and its consideration by the national bureau of standards as a possible federal standard for cryptography 48 des was designed to be resistant to differential cryptanalysis 49 a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the nsa and ibm that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s 50 according to steven levy ibm discovered differential cryptanalysis 51 but kept the technique secret at the nsa s request the technique became publicly known only when biham and shamir re discovered and announced it some years later the entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have another instance of the nsa s involvement was the 1993 clipper chip affair an encryption microchip intended to be part of the capstone cryptography control initiative clipper was widely criticized by cryptographers for two reasons the cipher algorithm called skipjack was then classified declassified in 1998 long after the clipper initiative lapsed the classified cipher caused concerns that the nsa had deliberately made the cipher weak in order to assist its intelligence efforts the whole initiative was also criticized based on its violation of kerckhoffs s principle as the scheme included a special escrow key held by the government for use by law enforcement for example in wiretaps 45 edit digital rights management main article digital rights management cryptography is central to digital rights management drm a group of techniques for technologically controlling use of copyrighted material being widely implemented and deployed at the behest of some copyright holders in 1998 american president bill clinton signed the digital millennium copyright act dmca which criminalized all production dissemination and use of certain cryptanalytic techniques and technology now known or later discovered specifically those that could be used to circumvent drm technological schemes 52 this had a noticeable impact on the cryptography research community since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violated or might violate the dmca similar statutes have since been enacted in several countries and regions including the implementation in the eu copyright directive similar restrictions are called for by treaties signed by world intellectual property organization member states the united states department of justice and fbi have not enforced the dmca as rigorously as had been feared by some but the law nonetheless remains a controversial one niels ferguson a well respected cryptography researcher has publicly stated 53 that he will not release some of his research into an intel security design for fear of prosecution under the dmca both alan cox longtime number 2 in linux kernel development and professor edward felten and some of his students at princeton have encountered problems related to the act dmitry sklyarov was arrested during a visit to the us from russia and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the dmca arising from work he had done in russia where the work was legal in 2007 the cryptographic keys responsible for blu ray and hd dvd content scrambling were discovered and released onto the internet in both cases the mpaa sent out numerous dmca takedown notices and there was a massive internet backlash 54 triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on fair use and free speech edit see also cryptography portal category cryptographers
