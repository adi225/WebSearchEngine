88 7 y 40 y 59 icd 9 995 2 e850 e858 diseasesdb 295 mesh d004362 an adverse drug reaction abbreviated adr is an expression that describes harm associated with the use of given medications at a normal dosage during normal use adrs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs the meaning of this expression differs from the meaning of side effect as this last expression might also imply that the effects can be beneficial 1 the study of adrs is the concern of the field known as pharmacovigilance an adverse drug event abbreviated ade refers to any injury caused by the drug at normal dosage and or due to overdose and any harm associated with the use of the drug e g discontinuation of drug therapy 2 adrs are a special type of ades contents 1 classification 1 1 cause 1 2 seriousness and severity 1 3 overall drug risk 1 4 location 2 mechanisms 2 1 abnormal pharmacokinetics 2 1 1 comorbid disease states 2 1 2

cause type a augmented pharmacologic effects dose dependent and predictable intolerance side effects type b bizarre effects or idiosyncratic dose independent and unpredictable type c chronic effects type d delayed effects type e end of treatment effects type f failure of therapy type g genetic reactions types a and b were proposed in the 1970s 3 and the other types were proposed subsequently when the first two proved insufficient to classify adrs 4 edit seriousness and severity the american food and drug administration defines a serious adverse event as one when the patient outcome is one of the following 5 death life threatening hospitalization initial or prolonged disability significant persistent or permanent change impairment damage or disruption in the patient s body function structure physical activities or quality of life congenital anomaly requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage severity is a point on an arbitrary scale of intensity of the adverse event in question the terms severe and serious when applied to adverse events are technically very different they are easily confused but can not be used interchangeably requiring care in usage a headache is severe if it causes intense pain there are scales like visual analog scale that help us who assess the severity on the other hand a headache is not usually serious but may be in case of subarachnoid haemorrhage subdural bleed even a migraine may temporally fit criteria unless it also satisfies the criteria for seriousness listed above edit overall drug risk while no official scale exists yet to communicate overall drug risk the iguard drug risk rating system is a five color rating scale similar to the homeland security advisory system 6 red high risk orange elevated risk yellow guarded risk blue general risk green low risk edit location adverse effects may be local i e limited to a certain location or systemic where a medication has caused adverse effects throughout the systemic circulation for instance some ocular antihypertensives cause systemic effects 7 although they are administered locally as eye drops since a fraction escapes to the systemic circulation edit mechanisms as research better explains the biochemistry of drug use fewer adrs are type b and more are type a common mechanisms are abnormal pharmacokinetics due to genetic factors comorbid disease states synergistic effects between either a drug and a disease two drugs edit abnormal pharmacokinetics edit comorbid disease states various diseases especially those that cause renal or hepatic insufficiency may alter drug metabolism resources are available that report changes in a drug s metabolism due to disease states 8 edit genetic factors abnormal drug metabolism may be due to inherited factors of either phase i oxidation or phase ii conjugation 9 10 pharmacogenomics is the study of the inherited basis for abnormal drug reactions edit phase i reactions inheriting abnormal alleles of cytochrome p450 can alter drug metabolism tables are available to check for drug interactions due to p450 interactions 11 12 inheriting abnormal butyrylcholinesterase pseudocholinesterase may affect metabolism of drugs such as succinylcholine 13 edit phase ii reactions inheriting abnormal n acetyltransferase which conjugated some drugs to facilitate excretion may affect the metabolism of drugs such as isoniazid hydralazine and procainamide 12 13 inheriting abnormal thiopurine s methyltransferase may affect the metabolism of the thiopurine drugs mercaptopurine and azathioprine 12 edit interactions with other drugs the risk of drug interactions is increased with polypharmacy edit protein binding these interactions are usually transient and mild until a new steady state is achieved 14 15 these are mainly for drugs without much first pass liver metabolism the principal plasma proteins for drug binding are 16 albumin 1 acid glycoprotein lipoproteins some drug interactions with warfarin are due to changes in protein binding 16 edit cytochrome p450 patients have abnormal metabolism by cytochrome p450 due to either inheriting abnormal alleles or due to drug interactions tables are available to check for drug interactions due to p450 interactions 11 edit synergistic effects an example of synergism is two drugs that both prolong the qt interval edit assessing causality causality assessment is used to determine the likelihood that a drug caused a suspected adr there are a number of different methods used to judge causation including the naranjo algorithm the venulet algorithm and the who causality term assessment criteria each have pros and cons associated with their use and most require some level of expert judgement to apply 17 an adr should not be labeled as certain unless the adr abates with a challenge dechallenge rechallenge protocol stopping and starting the agent in question the chronology of the onset of the suspected adr is important as another substance or factor may be implicated as a cause co prescribed medications and underlying psychiatric conditions may be factors in the adr a simple scale is available at http annals org cgi content full 140 10 795 1 assigning causality to a specific agent often proves difficult unless the event is found during a clinical study or large databases are used both methods have difficulties and can be fraught with error even in clinical studies some adrs may be missed as large numbers of test individuals are required to find that adverse drug reaction psychiatric adrs are often missed as they are grouped together in the questionnaires used to assess the population 1 2 3 edit monitoring bodies many countries have official bodies that monitor drug safety and reactions on an international level
