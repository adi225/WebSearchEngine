library and information science lis sometimes given as the plural library and information sciences 1 2 is a merging of the two fields library science and information science the phrase library and information science is associated with schools of library and information science abbreviated to slis which generally developed from professional training programs not academic disciplines to university institutions during the second half of the twentieth century in the last part of 1960s schools of librarianship began to add the term information science to their names the first school to do this was at the university of pittsburgh in 1964 3 more schools followed during the 1970s and 1980s and by the 1990s almost all library schools in the usa had added information science to their names the trend was more for the adoption of information technology rather than the concept of a science a similar development has taken place in large parts of the world in denmark for example the royal school of librarianship in 1997 changed its english name to the royal school of library and information science another indication of this name shift is that library science abstracts in 1969 changed its name to library and information science abstracts 4 in spite of this merge are the two original disciplines library science and information science still by some considered to be separate fields 5 6 while the main tendency today is to use the terms as synonyms but with different connotations in some parts of the world the development has been somewhat different in france for example information science and communication studies form one interdiscipline 7 in troms norway documentation science is preferred as the name of the field in the beginning of the 21st century one tendency has been to drop the term library and to speak about information departments or i schools citation needed there has also been an attempt to revive the concept of documentation and speak of library information and documentation studies or science 8 another tendency for example in sweden is to merge the fields of archival science library science and museology to develop an integrated field

further reading 10 references edit relations between library science information science and lis tefko saracevic 1992 p 160 13 5 argued that library science and information science are separate fields the common ground between library science and information science which is a strong one is in the sharing of their social role and in their general concern with the problems of effective utilization of graphic records but there are also very significant differences in several critical respects among them in 1 selection of problems addressed and in the way they were defined 2 theoretical questions asked and frameworks established 3 the nature and degree of experimentation and empirical development and the resulting practical knowledge competencies derived 4 tools and approaches used and 5 the nature and strength of interdisciplinary relations established and the dependence of the progress and evolution of interdisciplinary approaches all of these differences warrant the conclusion that librarianship and information science are two different fields in a strong interdisciplinary relation rather than one and the same field or one being a special case of the other another indication of the different uses of the two terms are the indexing in umi s dissertations abstracts in dissertations abstracts online on november 2011 were 4888 dissertations indexed with the descriptor library science and 9053 with the descriptor information science for the year 2009 the numbers were 104 library science and 514 information science 891 dissertations were indexed with both terms 36 in 2009 it should be considered that information science grew out of documentation science and therefore has a tradition for considering scientific and scholarly communication bibliographic databases subject knowledge and terminology etc library science on the other hand has mostly concentrated on libraries and their internal processes and best practices it is also relevant to consider that information science used to be done by scientists while librarianship has been split between public libraries and scholarly research libraries library schools have mainly educated librarians for public libraries and not shown much interest in scientific communication and documentation when information scientists from 1964 entered library schools they brought with them competencies in relation to information retrieval in subject databases including concepts such as recall and precision boolean search techniques query formulation and related issues subject bibliographic databases and citation indexes provided a major step forward in information dissemination and also in the curriculum at library schools julian warner 2010 9 suggests that the information and computer science tradition in information retrieval may broadly be characterized as query transformation with the query articulated verbally by the user in advance of searching and then transformed by a system into a set of records from librarianship and indexing on the other hand has been an implicit stress on selection power enabling the user to make relevant selections edit difficulties defining lis the question what is library and information science does not elicit responses of the same internal conceptual coherence as similar inquiries as to the nature of other fields e g what is chemistry what is economics what is medicine each of those fields though broad in scope has clear ties to basic concerns of their field neither lis theory nor practice is perceived to be monolithic nor unified by a common literature or set of professional skills occasionally lis scholars many of whom do not self identify as members of an interreading lis community or prefer names other than lis attempt but are unable to find core concepts in common some believe that computing and internetworking concepts and skills underlie virtually every important aspect of lis indeed see lis as a sub field of computer science footnote iii 1 others claim that lis is principally a social science accompanied by practical skills such as ethnography and interviewing historically traditions of public service bibliography documentalism and information science have viewed their mission their philosophical toolsets and their domain of research differently still others deny the existence of a greater metropolitan lis viewing lis instead as a loosely organized collection of specialized interests often unified by nothing more than their shared and fought over use of the descriptor information indeed claims occasionally arise to the effect that the field even has no theory of its own konrad 2007 p 652 653 edit a multidisciplinary interdisciplinary or monodisciplinary field the swedish researcher emin tengstr m 1993 10 described cross disciplinary research as a process not a state or structure he differentiates three levels of ambition regarding cross disciplinary research the pluridisciplinary or multidisciplinarity level the genuine cross disciplinary level interdisciplinarity the discipline forming level transdisciplinarity what is described here is a view of social fields as dynamic and changing library and information science is viewed as a field that started as a multidisciplinary field based on literature psychology sociology management computer science etc which is developing towards an academic discipline in its own right however the following quote seems to indicate that lis is actually developing in the opposite direction chua amp yang 2008 11 studied papers published in journal of the american society for information science and technology in the period 1988 1997 and found among other things top authors have grown in diversity from those being affiliated predominantly with library information related departments to include those from information systems management information technology business and the humanities amid heterogeneous clusters of collaboration among top authors strongly connected crossdisciplinary coauthor pairs have become more prevalent correspondingly the distribution of top keywords occurrences that leans heavily on core information science has shifted towards other subdisciplines such as information technology and sociobehavioral science as a field with its own body of interrelated concepts techniques journals and professional associations lis is clearly a discipline but by the nature of its subject matter and methods lis is just as clearly an interdiscipline drawing on many adjacent fields see below edit a fragmented adhocracy richard whitley 1984 12 2000 13 classified scientific fields according to their intellectual and social organization and described management studies as a fragmented adhocracy a field with a low level of coordination around a diffuse set of goals and a non specialized terminology but with strong connections to the practice in the business sector str m 2006 14 applied this conception to the description of lis edit scattering of the literature meho amp spurgin 2005 15 found that in a list of 2 625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 schools of library and information science only 10 databases provided significant coverage of the lis literature results also show that restricting the data sources to one two or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the lis literature researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes even when the nine most comprehensive databases in lis was searched and combined 27 0 or 710 of 2 635 of the publications remain not found the study confirms earlier research that lis literature is highly scattered and is not limited to standard lis databases what was not known or verified before however is that a significant amount of this literature is indexed in the interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary databases of inside conferences and inspec other interdisciplinary databases such as america history and life were also found to be very useful and complementary to traditional lis databases particularly in the areas of archives and library history meho amp spurgin 2005 p 1329 edit the unique concern of library and information science concern for people becoming informed is not unique to lis and thus is insufficient to differentiate lis from other fields lis are a part of a larger enterprise konrad 2007 p 160 655 16 the unique concern of lis is recognized as statement of the core concern of lis humans becoming informed constructing meaning via intermediation between inquirers and instrumented records no other field has this as its concern konrad 2007 p 160 660 note that the promiscuous term information does not appear in the above statement circumscribing the field s central concerns the detrimental effects of the ambiguity this term provokes are discussed above part iii furner furner 2004 427 has shown that discourse in the field is improved where specific terms are utilized in place of the i word for specific senses of that term konrad 2007 p 160 661 michael buckland wrote educational programs in library information and documentation are concerned with what people know are not limited to technology and require wide ranging expertise they differ fundamentally and importantly from computer science programs and from the information systems programs found in business schools 17 edit lis theories julian warner 2010 p 160 4 5 9 suggests that two paradigms the cognitive and the physical have been distinguished in information retrieval research but they share the assumption of the value of delivering relevant records ellis 1984 19 18 belkin and vickery 1985 114 19 for the purpose of discussion here they can be considered a single heterogeneous paradigm linked but not united by this common assumption the value placed on query transformation is dissonant with common practice where users may prefer to explore an area and may value fully informed exploration some dissenting research discussions have been more congruent with practice advocating explorative capability the ability to explore and make discriminations between representations of objects as the fundamental design principle for information retrieval systems the domain analytic approach e g hj rland 2010 20 suggests that the relevant criteria for making discriminations in information retrieval are scientific and scholarly criteria in some fields e g evidence based medicine 21 the relevant distinctions are very explicit in other cases they are implicit or unclear at the basic level the relevance of bibliographical records are determined by epistemological criteria of what constitutes knowledge among other approaches evidence based library and information practice should also be mentioned edit
