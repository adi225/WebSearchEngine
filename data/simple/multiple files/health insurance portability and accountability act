the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa pub l 104 191 110 160 stat 160 1936 enacted august 160 21 1996 was enacted by the united states congress and signed by president bill clinton in 1996 it was sponsored by sen nancy kassebaum r kan 1 title i of hipaa protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs title ii of hipaa known as the administrative simplification as provisions requires the establishment of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers health insurance plans and employers 2 the administrative simplification provisions also address the security and privacy of health data the standards are meant to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the nation s health care system by encouraging the widespread use of electronic data interchange in the u s health care system citation needed contents 1 title i health care access portability and

legislative information 8 references 9 external links edit title i health care access portability and renewability title i of hipaa regulates the availability and breadth of group health plans and certain individual health insurance policies it amended the employee retirement income security act the public health service act and the internal revenue code title i also limits restrictions that a group health plan can place on benefits for preexisting conditions group health plans may refuse to provide benefits relating to preexisting conditions for a period of 12 months after enrollment in the plan or 18 months in the case of late enrollment 3 however individuals may reduce this exclusion period if they had group health plan coverage or health insurance prior to enrolling in the plan title i allows individuals to reduce the exclusion period by the amount of time that they had creditable coverage prior to enrolling in the plan and after any significant breaks in coverage 4 creditable coverage is defined quite broadly and includes nearly all group and individual health plans medicare and medicaid 5 a significant break in coverage is defined as any 63 day period without any creditable coverage 6 some health care plans are exempted from title i requirements such as long term health plans and limited scope plans such as dental or vision plans that are offered separately from the general health plan however if such benefits are part of the general health plan then hipaa still applies to such benefits for example if the new plan offers dental benefits then it must count creditable continuous coverage under the old health plan towards any of its exclusion periods for dental benefits an alternate method of calculating creditable continuous coverage is available to the health plan under title i that is 5 categories of health coverage can be considered separately including dental and vision coverage anything not under those 5 categories must use the general calculation e g the beneficiary may be counted with 18 months of general coverage but only 6 months of dental coverage because the beneficiary did not have a general health plan that covered dental until 6 months prior to the application date since limited coverage plans are exempt from hipaa requirements the odd case exists in which the applicant to a general group health plan cannot obtain certificates of creditable continuous coverage for independent limited scope plans such as dental to apply towards exclusion periods of the new plan that does include those coverages hidden exclusion periods are not valid under title i e g the accident to be covered must have occurred while the beneficiary was covered under this exact same health insurance contract such clauses must not be acted upon by the health plan and also must be re written so that they comply with hipaa to illustrate suppose someone enrolls in a group health plan on january 1 2006 this person had previously been insured from january 1 2004 until february 1 2005 and from august 1 2005 until december 31 2005 to determine how much coverage can be credited against the exclusion period in the new plan start at the enrollment date and count backwards until a significant break in coverage is reached so the five months of coverage between august 1 2005 and december 31 2005 clearly counts against the exclusion period but the period without insurance between february 1 2005 and august 1 2005 is greater than 63 days thus this is a significant break in coverage and any coverage prior to it cannot be deducted from the exclusion period so this person could deduct five months from his exclusion period reducing the exclusion period to seven months hence title i requires that any preexisting condition begin to be covered on august 1 2006 edit title ii preventing health care fraud and abuse administrative simplification medical liability reform this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed april 2010 title ii of hipaa defines policies procedures and guidelines for maintaining the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information as well as outlining numerous offenses relating to health care and sets civil and criminal penalties for violations it also creates several programs to control fraud and abuse within the health care system 7 8 9 however the most significant provisions of title ii are its administrative simplification rules title ii requires the department of health and human services hhs to draft rules aimed at increasing the efficiency of the health care system by creating standards for the use and dissemination of health care information these rules apply to covered entities as defined by hipaa and the hhs covered entities include health plans health care clearinghouses such as billing services and community health information systems and health care providers that transmit health care data in a way that is regulated by hipaa 10 11 per the requirements of title ii the hhs has promulgated five rules regarding administrative simplification the privacy rule the transactions and code sets rule the security rule the unique identifiers rule and the enforcement rule edit privacy rule the effective compliance date of the privacy rule was april 14 2003 with a one year extension for certain small plans the hipaa privacy rule regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information phi held by covered entities generally health care clearinghouses employer sponsored health plans health insurers and medical service providers that engage in certain transactions 12 by regulation the department of health and human services extended the hipaa privacy rule to independent contractors of covered entities who fit within the definition of business associates 13 phi is any information held by a covered entity which concerns health status provision of health care or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual 14 this is interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of an individual s medical record or payment history covered entities must disclose phi to the individual within 30 days upon request 15 they also must disclose phi when required to do so by law such as reporting suspected child abuse to state child welfare agencies 16 a covered entity may disclose phi protected health information to facilitate treatment payment or health care operations without a patient s express written authorization 17 any other disclosures of phi protected health information require the covered entity to obtain written authorization from the individual for the disclosure 18 however when a covered entity discloses any phi it must make a reasonable effort to disclose only the minimum necessary information required to achieve its purpose 19 the privacy rule gives individuals the right to request that a covered entity correct any inaccurate phi 20 it also requires covered entities to take reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of communications with individuals 21 for example an individual can ask to be called at his or her work number instead of home or cell phone numbers the privacy rule requires covered entities to notify individuals of uses of their phi covered entities must also keep track of disclosures of phi and document privacy policies and procedures 22 they must appoint a privacy official and a contact person 23 responsible for receiving complaints and train all members of their workforce in procedures regarding phi 24 an individual who believes that the privacy rule is not being upheld can file a complaint with the department of health and human services office for civil rights ocr 25 26 however according to the wall street journal the ocr has a long backlog and ignores most complaints complaints of privacy violations have been piling up at the department of health and human services between april of 2003 and november 2006 the agency fielded 23 886 complaints related to medical privacy rules but it has not yet taken any enforcement actions against hospitals doctors insurers or anyone else for rule violations a spokesman for the agency says it has closed three quarters of the complaints typically because it found no violation or after it provided informal guidance to the parties involved 27 however in july 2011 ucla agreed to pay 865 500 in a settlement regarding potential hipaa violations an hhs office for civil rights investigation showed that from 2005 to 2008 unauthorized employees repeatedly and without legitimate cause looked at the electronic protected health information of numerous uclahs patients 28 edit transactions and code sets rule hipaa was intended to make the health care system in the united states more efficient by standardizing health care transactions hipaa added a new part c titled administrative simplification to title xi of the social security act this is supposed to simplify health care transactions by requiring all health plans to engage in health care transactions in a standardized way the hipaa edi provision was scheduled to take effect from october 16 2003 with a one year extension for certain small plans however due to widespread confusion and difficulty in implementing the rule cms granted a one year extension to all parties citation needed on january 1 2012 newer versions asc x12 005010 and ncpdp d 0 become effective replacing the previous asc x12 004010 and ncpdp 5 1 mandate 29 the asc x12 005010 version provides a mechanism allowing the use of icd 10 cm as well as other improvements after july 1 2005 most medical providers that file electronically did have to file their electronic claims using the hipaa standards in order to be paid citation needed under hipaa hipaa covered health plans are now required to use standardized hipaa electronic transactions see 42 usc 1320d 2 and 45 cfr part 162 information about this can be found in the final rule for hipaa electronic transaction standards 74 fed reg 3296

billing payment information between payers with different payment responsibilities where coordination of benefits is required or between payers and regulatory agencies to monitor the rendering billing and or payment of health care services within a specific health care insurance industry segment for example a state mental health agency may mandate all healthcare claims providers and health plans who trade professional medical health care claims electronically must use the 837 health care claim professional standard to send in claims as there are many different business applications for the health care claim there can be slight derivations to cover off claims involving unique claims such as for institutions professionals chiropractors and dentists etc edi retail pharmacy claim

30 31 edit security rule the final rule on security standards was issued on february 20 2003 it took effect on april 21 2003 with a compliance date of april 21 2005 for most covered entities and april 21 2006 for small plans the security rule complements the privacy rule while the privacy rule pertains to all protected health information phi including paper and electronic the security rule deals specifically with electronic protected health information ephi it lays out three types of security safeguards required for compliance administrative physical and technical for each of these types the rule identifies various security standards and for each standard it names both required and addressable implementation specifications required specifications must be adopted and administered as dictated by the rule addressable specifications are more flexible individual covered entities can evaluate their own situation and determine the best way to implement addressable specifications some privacy advocates have argued that this flexibility may provide too much latitude to covered entities 32 the standards and specifications are as follows administrative safeguards policies and procedures designed to clearly show how the entity will comply with the act covered entities entities that must comply with hipaa requirements must adopt a written set of privacy procedures and designate a privacy officer to be responsible for developing and implementing all required policies and procedures the policies and procedures must reference management oversight and organizational buy in to compliance with the documented security controls procedures should clearly identify employees or classes of employees who will have access to electronic protected health information ephi access to ephi must be restricted to only those employees who have a need for it to complete their job function the procedures must address access authorization establishment modification and termination entities must show that an appropriate ongoing training program regarding the handling of phi is provided to employees performing health plan administrative functions covered entities that out source some of their business processes to a third party must ensure that their vendors also have a framework in place to comply with hipaa requirements companies typically gain this assurance through clauses in the contracts stating that the vendor will meet the same data protection requirements that apply to the covered entity care must be taken to determine if the vendor further out sources any data handling functions to other vendors and monitor whether appropriate contracts and controls are in place a contingency plan should be in place for responding to emergencies covered entities are responsible for backing up their data and having disaster recovery procedures in place the plan should document data priority and failure analysis testing activities and change control procedures internal audits play a key role in hipaa compliance by reviewing operations with the goal of identifying potential security violations policies and procedures should specifically document the scope frequency and procedures of audits audits should be both routine and event based procedures should document instructions for addressing and responding to security breaches that are identified either during the audit or the normal course of operations a nurse shredding papers in order to be compliant with the physical safeguard section of hipaa s privacy rule physical safeguards controlling physical access to protect against inappropriate access to protected data controls must govern the introduction and removal of hardware and software from the network when equipment is retired it must be disposed of properly to ensure that phi is not compromised access to equipment containing health information should be carefully controlled and monitored access to hardware and software must be limited to properly authorized individuals required access controls consist of facility security plans maintenance records and visitor sign in and escorts policies are required to address proper workstation use workstations should be removed from high traffic areas and monitor screens should not be in direct view of the public if the covered entities utilize contractors or agents they too must be fully trained on their physical access responsibilities technical safeguards controlling access to computer systems and enabling covered entities to protect communications containing phi transmitted electronically over open networks from being intercepted by anyone other than the intended recipient information systems housing phi must be protected from intrusion when information flows over open networks some form of encryption must be utilized if closed systems networks are utilized existing access controls are considered sufficient and encryption is optional each covered entity is responsible for ensuring that the data within its systems has not been changed or erased in an unauthorized manner data corroboration including the use of check sum double keying message authentication and digital signature may be used to ensure data integrity covered entities must also authenticate entities with which they communicate authentication consists of corroborating that an entity is who it claims to be examples of corroboration include password systems two or three way handshakes telephone callback and token systems covered entities must make documentation of their hipaa practices available to the government to determine compliance in addition to policies and procedures and access records information technology documentation should also include a written record of all configuration settings on the components of the network because these components are complex configurable and always changing documented risk analysis and risk management programs are required covered entities must carefully consider the risks of their operations as they implement systems to comply with the act the requirement of risk analysis and risk management implies that the act s security requirements are a minimum standard and places responsibility on covered entities to take all reasonable precautions necessary to prevent phi from being used for non health purposes edit unique identifiers rule national provider identifier hipaa covered entities such as providers completing electronic transactions healthcare clearinghouses and large health plans must use only the national provider identifier npi to identify covered healthcare providers in standard transactions by may 23 2007 small health plans must use only the npi by may 23 2008 effective from may 2006 may 2007 for small health plans all covered entities using electronic communications e g physicians hospitals health insurance companies and so forth must use a single new npi the npi replaces all other identifiers used by health plans medicare medicaid and other government programs however the npi does not replace a provider s dea number state license number or tax identification number the npi is 10 digits may be alphanumeric with the last digit being a checksum the npi cannot contain any embedded intelligence in other words the npi is simply a number that does not itself have any additional meaning the npi is unique and national never re used and except for institutions a provider usually can have only one an institution may obtain multiple npis for different subparts such as a free standing cancer center or rehab facility edit enforcement rule on february 16 2006 hhs issued the final rule regarding hipaa enforcement it became effective on march 16 2006 the enforcement rule sets civil money penalties for violating hipaa rules and establishes procedures for investigations and hearings for hipaa violations for many years there were few prosecutions for violations 33 this may have changed with the fining of 50 000 to the hospice of north idaho honi as the first entity to be fined for a potential hipaa security rule breach affecting fewer than 500 people 34 rachel seeger a spokeswoman for hhs stated honi did not conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis to the confidentiality of ephi as part of its security management process from 2005 through jan 17 2012 this investigation was initiated with the an unencrypted laptop containing 441 patient records being stolen from an employee s vehicle wikisource has original text related to this article american recovery

hitech act edit effects on research and clinical care the enactment of the privacy and security rules has caused major changes in the way physicians and medical centers operate the complex legalities and potentially stiff penalties associated with hipaa as well as the increase in paperwork and the cost of its implementation were causes for concern among physicians and medical centers an august 2006 article in the journal annals of internal medicine detailed some such concerns over the implementation and effects of hipaa 35 edit effects on research hipaa restrictions on researchers have affected their ability to perform retrospective chart based research as well as their ability to prospectively evaluate patients by contacting them for follow up a study from the university of michigan demonstrated that implementation of the hipaa privacy rule resulted in a drop from 96 to 34 in the proportion of follow up surveys completed by study patients being followed after a heart attack 36 another study detailing the effects of hipaa on recruitment for a study on cancer prevention demonstrated that hipaa mandated changes led to a 73 decrease in patient accrual a tripling of time spent recruiting patients and a tripling of mean recruitment costs 37 in addition informed consent forms for research studies now are required to include extensive detail on how the participant s protected health information will be kept private while such information is important the addition of a lengthy legalistic section on privacy may make these already complex documents even less user friendly for patients who are asked to read and sign them these data suggest that the hipaa privacy rule as currently implemented may be having negative impacts on the cost and quality of medical research dr kim eagle professor of internal medicine at the university of michigan was quoted in the annals article as saying privacy is important but research is also important for improving care we hope that we will figure this out and do it right 35 edit effects on clinical care the complexity of hipaa combined with potentially stiff penalties for violators can lead physicians and medical centers to withhold information from those who may have a right to it a review of the implementation of the hipaa privacy rule by the u s government accountability office found that health care providers were uncertain about their legal privacy responsibilities and often responded with an overly guarded approach to disclosing information than necessary to ensure compliance with the privacy rule 35 reports of this uncertainty continue 38 edit costs of implementation in the period immediately prior to the enactment of the hipaa privacy and security acts medical centers and medical practices were charged with getting into compliance with an early emphasis on the potentially severe penalties associated with violation many practices and centers turned to private for profit hipaa consultants who were intimately familiar with the details of the legislation and offered their services to ensure that physicians and medical centers were fully in compliance in addition to the costs of developing and revamping systems and practices the increase in paperwork and staff time necessary to meet the legal requirements of hipaa may impact the finances of medical centers and practices at a time when insurance companies and medicare reimbursement is also declining edit education and training education and training of healthcare providers is paramount to correct implementation of the hipaa privacy and security acts effective training must describe the statutory and regulatory background and purpose of hipaa and a general summary of the principles and key provisions of the privacy

protected by the privacy rule the presentation extensively describes the required and permitted uses and disclosures of phi by a covered entity or its business associate including situations where phi may be used or disclosed without the individual s authorization and when such authorization is required the rule s minimum necessary provisions and its requirements are explained summarizes the privacy rule s provisions and requirements related to research describes when a covered entity may use and disclose phi for research purposes and what research is affected the presentation illustrates
