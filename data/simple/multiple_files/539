release life cycle map a software release life cycle is the sum of the phases of development and maturity for a piece of computer software ranging from its initial development to its eventual release and including updated versions of the released version to help improve software or fix bugs still present in the software contents 1 stages of development 1 1 history 1 2 pre alpha 1 3 alpha 1 4 beta

used similar terminology for their hardware development a test was the verification of a new product before public announcement b test was the verification before releasing the product to be manufactured c test was the final test before general availability of the product as software became a significant part of ibm s offerings the alpha test terminology was used to denote the pre announcement test and beta test was used to show product readiness for general availability martin belsky a manager on some of ibm s earlier software projects claimed to have invented the terminology ibm dropped the alpha beta terminology during the 1960s but by then it had gotten fairly wide notice the usage of beta test to refer to testing done by customers was not done in ibm rather ibm used the term field test 1 edit pre alpha pre alpha refers to all activities performed during the software project before testing these activities can include requirements analysis software design software development and unit testing in typical open source development there are several types of pre alpha versions milestone versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the functionality is complete edit alpha the alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin software testing alpha is the first letter of the greek alphabet used as the number 1 in this phase developers generally test the software using white box techniques additional validation is then performed using black box or gray box techniques by another testing team moving to black box testing inside the organization is known as alpha release 2 alpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss the exception to this is when the alpha is available publicly such as a pre order bonus in which developers normally push for stability so that their testers can test properly external availability of alpha software is uncommon in proprietary software however open source software in particular often have publicly available alpha versions often distributed as the raw source code of the software the alpha phase usually ends with a feature freeze indicating that no more features will be added to the software at this time the software is said to be feature complete edit beta beta in other words prototype named after the second letter of the greek alphabet is the software development phase following alpha it generally begins when the software is feature complete software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software as well as speed performance issues the focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users often incorporating usability testing the process of delivering a beta version to the users is called beta release and this is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it the users of a beta version are called beta testers they are usually customers or prospective customers of the organization that develops the software willing to test the software without charge often receiving the final software free of charge or for a reduced price beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organization and to prospective customers some developers refer to this stage as a preview prototype technical preview tp or early access some software is kept in perpetual beta where new features and functionality are continually added to the software without establishing a firm final release edit open and closed beta developers release either a closed beta or an open beta closed beta versions are released to a restricted group of individuals for a user test by invitation while open beta testers are from a larger group or anyone interested the testers report any bugs that they find and sometimes suggest additional features they think should be available in the final version examples of a major public beta test are in september 2000 a boxed version of apple s mac os x public beta operating system was released 3 microsoft s release of community technology preview s ctp s for longhorn in january 2005 4 open betas serve the dual purpose of demonstrating a product to potential consumers and testing among an extremely wide user base likely to bring to light obscure errors that a much smaller testing team might not find edit impact of the world wide web as the internet has facilitated rapid and inexpensive distribution of software companies have begun to take a looser approach to use of the word beta 5 in february 2005 zdnet published an article about the recent phenomenon of a beta version often staying for years and being used as if it were in production level disparagingly called perpetual beta it noted that gmail and google news for example had been in beta for a long period of time and were not expected to drop the beta status despite the fact that they were widely used however google news did leave beta in january 2006 followed by google apps including gmail in july 2009 6 this technique may allow a developer to delay offering full support and responsibility for remaining issues in the context of web 2 0 people even talk of perpetual betas to signify that some software is meant to stay in beta state also beta is sometimes used to indicate something more like a release candidate or as a form of time limited demo or marketing technique 7 edit release candidate a release candidate rc is a beta version with potential to be a final product which is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge in this stage of product stabilization all product features have been designed coded and tested through one or more beta cycles with no known showstopper class bug a release is called code complete when the development team agrees that no entirely new source code will be added to this release there could still be source code changes to fix defects changes to documentation and data files and peripheral code for test cases or utilities beta testers if privately selected will often be credited for using the release candidate as though it were a finished product beta testing is conducted in a client s or customer s location and to test the software from a user s perspective edit release edit release to manufacturing rtm gold master and golden master redirect here for other uses see gold master disambiguation the term release to manufacturing or release to marketing citation needed both abbreviated rtm initials also commonly used for the quite different return to manufacturer of faulty goods also known as going gold is a term used when software is ready for or has been delivered or provided to the customer it is typically used in certain retail mass production software contexts as opposed to a specialized software production or project in a commercial or government production and distribution where the software is sold as part of a bundle in a related computer hardware sale and typically where the software and related hardware is ultimately to be available and sold on mass public basis at retail stores to indicate that the software has met a defined quality level and is ready for mass retail distribution rtm could also mean in other contexts that the software has been delivered or released to a client or customer for installation or distribution to the related hardware end user computers or machines the term does not define the delivery mechanism or volume it only states that the quality is sufficient for mass distribution the deliverable from the engineering organization is frequently in the form of a golden master media used for duplication or to produce the image for the web rtm precedes general availability ga when the product is released to the public edit general availability ga general availability or general acceptance citation needed ga is the point where all necessary commercialization activities have been completed and the software has been made available to the general market either via the web or physical media commercialization activities could include but are not limited to the availability of media world wide via dispersed distribution centers marketing collateral is completed and available in as many languages as deemed necessary for the target market the finishing of security and compliance tests etc the time between rtm and ga can be from a week to months in some cases before a generally available release can be declared because of the time needed to complete all commercialization activities required by ga it is also at this stage that the software is considered to have gone live the production live version is the final version of a particular product a live release is considered to be very stable and relatively bug free with a quality suitable for wide distribution and use by end users in commercial software releases this version may also be signed used to allow end users to verify that code has not been modified since the release the expression that a software product has gone live means that the code has been completed and is ready for distribution other terms for the live version include live master live release and live build in some areas of software development it is at this stage that the release is referred to as a grand or gold release the latter seems to be confined mainly to game software though apple also refer to gm gold master releases some release versions might be classified as a long term support lts release which should guarantee the ability to upgrade to the next lts release and will be supported updated patched for a longer time than a non lts release edit release to web release to web or web release is a means of software delivery that utilizes the internet for distribution no physical media are produced in this type of release mechanism by the manufacturer web releases became more common as internet usage grew edit support during its supported lifetime software is sometimes subjected to service releases or service packs sometimes also called interim releases for example microsoft s windows xp operating system had three major service packs for the 32 bit version and two for the 64 bit version service packs during its lifetime such service releases contain a collection of updates fixes and enhancements delivered in the form of a single installable package they may also implement new features some software is released with the expectation of regular support classes of software that generally involve protracted support as the norm include anti virus suites and massively multiplayer online games a good example of a game that utilizes this process is minecraft an indie game developed by mojang which features regular updates featuring new content and bug fixes edit end of life see also end of life product 160 and abandonware when software is no longer sold or supported the product is said to have reached end of life to be discontinued or obsolete but user loyalty may continue its existence for some time even long after its platform is obsolete e g the atari st and
