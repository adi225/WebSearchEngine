web scraping web harvesting or web data extraction is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites usually such software programs simulate human exploration of the world wide web by either implementing low level hypertext transfer protocol http or embedding a fully fledged web browser such as internet explorer or mozilla firefox web scraping is closely related to web indexing which indexes information on the web using a bot or web crawler and is a universal technique adopted by most search engines in contrast web scraping focuses more on the transformation of unstructured data on the web typically in html format into structured data that can be stored and analyzed in a central local database or spreadsheet web scraping is also related to web automation which simulates human browsing using computer software uses of web scraping include online price comparison weather data monitoring website change detection research web mashup and web data

automatically collecting information from the world wide web it is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing semantic understanding artificial intelligence and human computer interactions web scraping instead favors practical solutions based on existing technologies that are often entirely ad hoc therefore there are different levels of automation that existing web scraping technologies can provide human copy and paste sometimes even the best web scraping technology cannot replace a human s manual examination and copy and paste and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation text grepping and regular expression matching a simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the unix grep command or regular expression matching facilities of programming languages for instance perl or python http programming static and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting http requests to the remote web server using socket programming data mining algorithms many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template in data mining a program that detects such templates in a particular information source extracts its content and translates it into a relational form is called a wrapper wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a url common scheme 1 dom parsing by embedding a full fledged web browser such as the internet explorer or the mozilla browser control programs can retrieve the dynamic contents generated by client side scripts these browser controls also parse web pages into a dom tree based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages html parsers some semi structured data query languages such as xquery and the htql can be used to parse html pages and to retrieve and transform page content web scraping software there are many software tools available that can be used to customize web scraping solutions this software may attempt to automatically recognize the data structure of a page or provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write web scraping code or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform content and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases vertical aggregation platforms there are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms these platforms create and monitor a multitude of bots for specific verticals with no man in the loop clarification needed and no work related to a specific target site the preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically the platform s robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves usually number of fields and its scalability how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites this scalability is mostly used to target the long tail of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor intensive to harvest content from semantic annotation recognizing the pages being scraped may embrace metadata or semantic markups and annotations which can be used to locate specific data snippets if the annotations are embedded in the pages as microformat does this technique can be viewed as a special case of dom parsing in another case the annotations organized into a semantic layer 2 are stored and managed separately from the web pages so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages edit legal issues web scraping may be against the terms of use of some websites the enforceability of these terms is unclear 3 while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal in the united states the courts ruled in feist publications v rural telephone service that duplication of facts is allowable u s courts have acknowledged that users of scrapers or robots may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels 4 5 which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing the best known of these cases ebay v bidder s edge resulted in an injunction ordering bidder s edge to stop accessing collecting and indexing auctions from the ebay web site this case involved automatic placing of bids known as auction sniping however in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff s possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant s unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels 6 one of the first major tests of screen scraping involved american airlines and a firm called farechase 7 aa successfully obtained an injunction from a texas trial court stopping farechase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if it also searches aa s website the airline argued that farechase s websearch software trespassed on aa s servers when it collected the publicly available data farechase filed an appeal in march 2003 by june farechase and aa agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped 8 southwest airlines has also challenged screen scraping practices and has involved both farechase and another firm outtask in a legal claim southwest airlines charged that the screen scraping is illegal since it is an example of computer fraud and abuse and has led to damage and loss and unauthorized access of southwest s site it also constitutes interference with business relations trespass and harmful access by computer they also claimed that screen scraping constitutes what is legally known as misappropriation and unjust enrichment and is also a breach of the website s user agreement outtask denied all these claims and claimed that the prevailing law in this case should be us copyright law and that under copyright the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection although the cases were never resolved in the supreme court of the united states farechase was eventually shuttered by parent company yahoo and outtask was purchased by travel expense company concur 9 although these are early scraping decisions and the theories of liability are not uniform it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites however the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper the amount of information accessed and copied the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner s system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct 10 while the law in this area becomes more settled entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site in the latest ruling in the cvent inc v eventbrite inc in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users attention in order for a browse wrap contract or license to be enforced 11 in the plaintiff s website during the period of this trial the terms of use link is displayed among all the links of the site at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet this ruling contradicts the irish ruling described below the court also rejected the plaintiff s argument that the browse wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of virginia s adoption of the uniform computer information transactions act ucita a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse wrap contracting practices 12 outside of the united states in a february 2006 ruling the danish maritime and commercial court copenhagen found systematic crawling indexing and deep linking by portal site ofir dk of real estate site home dk not to conflict with danish law or the database directive of the european union 13 in a february 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction ireland s an ard ch irt delivered a verdict that illustrates the inchoate state of developing case law in the case of ryanair ltd v billigfluege de gmbh ireland s high court ruled ryanair s click wrap agreement to be legally binding in contrast to the findings of the united states district court eastern district of virginia and those of the danish maritime and commercial court mr justice michael hanna ruled that the hyperlink to ryanair s terms and conditions was plainly visible and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship 14 the decision is under appeal in ireland s supreme court the c irt uachtarach na h ireann 15 in australia the spam act 2003 outlaws some forms of web harvesting although this only applies to email addresses 16 17 edit technical measures to stop bots the administrator of a website can use various measures to stop or slow a bot some techniques include if the application is well behaved adding entries to robots txt will be adhered to google and other well behaved bots can be stopped this way blocking an ip address this will also block all browsing from that address disabling any web service api that the website s system might expose bots sometimes declare who they are and can be blocked on that basis googlebot is an example some bots make no distinction between themselves and a human browser bots can be blocked by excess traffic monitoring bots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site like a captcha bots are sometimes coded to explicitly break specific captcha patterns commercial anti bot services several companies such as distil siteblackbox and sentor offer anti bot and anti scraping services for websites a few web application firewalls have limited bot detection capabilities as well locating bots with a honeypot or other method to identify the ip
