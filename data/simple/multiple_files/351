scientific engineering and technological education and research founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the united states the institute adopted the european polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date 9 mit s early emphasis on applied technology at the undergraduate and graduate levels led to close cooperation with industry curricular reforms under karl compton and vannevar bush in the 1930s re emphasized basic scientific research 10 mit was elected to the association of american universities in 1934 researchers were involved in efforts to develop computers radar and inertial guidance in connection with defense research during world war ii and the cold war post war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under james killian the current 168 acre 68 0 160 ha campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile 1 6 160 km along the northern bank of the charles river basin 5

stereographic card showing an mit mechanical drafting studio 19th century photo by e l allen left right inverted original rogers building mit back bay boston 19th century photo by e l allen in 1859 various individuals and bostonian organizations submitted to the massachusetts general court a proposal to use newly opened lands in back bay boston for a conservatory of art and science but the proposal failed 19 20 a later proposal by william barton rogers led to a charter for the incorporation of the massachusetts institute of technology which was signed by the governor of massachusetts on april 10 1861 21 rogers sought to establish a new institution of higher education to address the challenges posed by the mid 19th century s rapid scientific and technological advances 22 23 though he valued first hand experience as part of a proper education he did not intend to found a professional school but advocated instruction in useful knowledge that combined elements of both professional and liberal education 24 writing that the true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is as i conceive the teaching not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts which can be done only in the workshop but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them and along with this a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws 25 the rogers plan as it came to be known reflected the german research university model emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories 26 edit early developments a 1905 map of mit s boston campus just two days after the issuance of the charter the first battle of the civil war broke out after years of delay caused by wartime funding and staffing difficulties mit s first classes were held in rented space at the mercantile building in downtown boston in 1865 27 though it was a private institution to be located in the middle of urban boston the new institute had a mission that matched the intent of the 1862 morrill land grant colleges act to fund institutions to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes and was thus named a land grant school 28 b in 1866 the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the back bay neighborhood 29 mit soon came to be called boston tech 29 after surviving a period of financial uncertainties the institute saw significant expansion in the last two decades of the 19th century under president francis amasa walker 30 programs in electrical chemical marine and sanitary engineering were introduced 31 32 new buildings were built and the size of the student body increased to well over 1000 30 the curriculum became increasingly vocational less and less focus was placed on theoretical topics 33 during these boston tech years mit faculty and alumni repeatedly rejected overtures from former mit faculty turned harvard university president charles w eliot to merge mit with harvard college s lawrence scientific school 34 a plaque of george eastman founder of eastman kodak in building 6 his nose is rubbed by students for good luck 35 mit reinforced its independence in 1916 when it moved to its new campus on a mile long tract on the cambridge side of the charles river 36 almost entirely on landfill c the neoclassical new technology campus was funded by donations from industrialist george eastman and designed by william w bosworth 38 edit curricular reforms in the 1930s president karl taylor compton and vice president effectively provost vannevar bush reformed the applied technology curriculum by re emphasizing the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and by reducing the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios 10 despite the challenges of the great depression the compton reforms renewed confidence in the ability of the institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering 39 the expansion and reforms cemented mit s academic reputation 10 though unlike ivy league schools mit catered more to middle class families and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants 40 the school was elected to the association of american universities in 1934 41 still as late as 1949 the lewis committee lamented in its report on the state of education at mit that the institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school a partly unjustified perception the committee sought to change the report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum recommended offering a broader education and warned against letting engineering and government sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities 42 43 the school of humanities arts and social sciences and the mit sloan school of management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful schools of science and engineering previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics management political science and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs 44 45 the school of humanities arts and social sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents howard w johnson and jerome wiesner between 1966 and 1980 46 edit defense research mit s involvement in military research surged during world war ii in 1941 vannevar bush was appointed head of the federal office of scientific research and development and directed funding to only a select group of universities including mit 47 engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at mit s radiation laboratory established in 1940 to assist the british military in developing microwave radar the work done there significantly impacted both the war and subsequent research in the area 48 other defense projects included gyroscope based and other complex control systems for gunsight bombsight and inertial navigation under charles stark draper s instrumentation laboratory 49 50 the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under project whirlwind 51 and high speed and high altitude photography under harold edgerton 52 53 by the end of the war mit became the nation s largest wartime r amp d contractor attracting some criticism of bush 47 employing nearly 4000 in the radiation laboratory alone 48 and receiving in excess of 100 million 1 2 billion in 2012 dollars before 1946 39 work on defense projects continued even after then post war government sponsored research at mit included sage and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and project apollo 54 these activities affected mit profoundly a 1949 report noted the lack of any great slackening in the pace of life at the institute to match the return to peacetime remembering the academic tranquillity of the prewar years though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities 55 indeed the faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of karl taylor compton president of mit between 1930 and 1948 james rhyne killian president from 1948 to 1957 and julius adams stratton chancellor from 1952 to 1957 whose institution building strategies shaped the expanding university by the 1950s mit no longer merely benefited the industries it had worked so closely with three decades prior and was much closer to its new patrons philanthropic foundations and the federal government 56 in late 1960s and early 1970s student and faculty activists protested against the vietnam war and mit s defense research 57 58 the union of concerned scientists was founded on march 4 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research towards environmental and social problems 59 mit ultimately divested itself from the instrumentation laboratory and moved all classified research off campus to the lincoln laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests 60 61 and the student body faculty and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities 57 62 edit

201 202 in 1970 the then dean of institute relations benson r snyder published the hidden curriculum arguing that education at mit was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education the successful student according to snyder was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms for example organized student groups had compiled course bibles collections of problem set and examination questions and answers to be used as references for later students this sort of gamesmanship snyder argued hindered the development of a creative intellect and contributed to student
