java operating system cross platform type text mining and cluster analysis license bsd license website http carrot2 org free software portal carrot 1 is an open source search results clustering engine 2 it can automatically cluster small collections of documents e g search results or document abstracts into thematic categories apart from two specialized search results clustering algorithms carrot offers ready to use components for fetching search results from various sources carrot is written in java and distributed under the bsd license contents 1 history 2 architecture and components 2 1

version of carrot was implemented in 2001 by dawid weiss as part of his msc thesis to validate the applicability of the stc clustering algorithm to clustering search results in polish 3 in 2003 a number of other search results clustering algorithms were added including lingo 4 a novel text clustering algorithm designed specifically for clustering of search results while the source code of carrot was available since 2002 it was only in 2006 when version 1 0 was officially released in the same year version 2 0 was released with improved user interface and extended tool set in 2009 version 3 0 brought significant improvements in clustering quality simplified api and new gui application for tuning clustering based on the eclipse rich client platform carrot releases release

architecture and components the architecture of carrot is based on processing components arranged into pipelines two major groups or processing components in carrot are document sources and clustering algorithms edit document sources document sources provide data for further processing typically they would e g fetch search results from an external search engine lucene solr index or load text files from a local disk currently carrot has built in support for the following document sources bing search api google search api lucene index opensearch pubmed solr server etools metasearch engine generic xml files other document sources can be integrated based on the code examples provided with carrot distribution edit clustering algorithms carrot offers two specialized document clustering algorithms 7 that place emphasis on the quality of cluster labels lingo 4 a clustering algorithm based on the singular value decomposition stc 8 suffix tree clustering other algorithms can be easily added to carrot edit apis carrot clustering can be called through a number of apis edit java api being implemented in java carrot can be integrated with java software through its native java api 9 edit c net api carrot provides a native c api for calling clustering from c net software without installing a java runtime the carrot c api requires net framework version 3 5 or later edit other platforms other platforms can call carrot clustering through the rest service exposed by the document clustering server example integration code is provided for php 5 c ruby and curl edit tools carrot2 document clustering workbench carrot offers a number of supporting tools that can be used to quickly set up clustering on custom data further tuning of clustering results and exposing carrot clustering as a remote service carrot2 document clustering workbench a standalone gui application for experimenting with carrot clustering on data from common search engines or custom data carrot2 document clustering server exposes carrot clustering as a rest service carrot2 command line interface applications that allow invoking carrot clustering from command line carrot2 web application exposes carrot clustering as a web application for end users edit spin offs edit carrot search carrot search 10 a commercial spin off of the carrot project works on further development of carrot offers a real time text clustering algorithm 11 compliant with the carrot framework as well as text mining consulting services based on open source and proprietary software edit carrot search labs carrot gave rise to a number of independent open source projects released under the umbrella of carrot search labs 12 currently the following projects are available randomized testing a junit test runner with built in utilities to make every test run slightly different randomized also an ant task for running junit tests on parallel jvms with load balancing and other bells and whistles high performance primitive collections for java lists sets maps and other collections of primitives for java tuned for highest performance and memory efficiency jsuffixarrays several java implementations of the suffix array data structure with different performance and memory characteristics junitbenchmarks a set of extensions for turning junit4 tests into performance micro benchmarks with gc monitoring time variance measurement and simple graphical visualizations smartsprites fully automatic maintenance of css sprites no tedious copying and pasting to the css when adding or changing sprited images edit references
