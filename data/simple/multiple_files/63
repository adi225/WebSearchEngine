business intelligence bi is a set of methodologies processes architectures and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information bi can handle large amounts of information to help identify and develop new opportunities making use of new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy can provide a competitive market advantage and long term stability 1 bi technologies provide historical current and predictive views of business operations common functions of business intelligence technologies are reporting online analytical processing analytics data mining process mining complex event processing business performance management benchmarking text mining predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics the goal of modern business intelligence deployments is to support better business decision making thus a bi system can be called a decision support system dss 2 though the term business intelligence is sometimes a synonym for competitive intelligence because they both support decision making bi uses technologies processes and applications to analyze mostly internal structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers analyzes and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors if understood broadly business intelligence can include the subset of competitive intelligence 3 contents 1 history 2 business

ibm researcher hans peter luhn used the term business intelligence he defined intelligence as the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal 4 business intelligence as it is understood today is said to have evolved from the decision support systems that began in the 1960s and developed throughout the mid 1980s dss originated in the computer aided models created to assist with decision making and planning from dss data warehouses executive information systems olap and business intelligence came into focus beginning in the late 80s in 1989 howard dresner later a gartner group analyst proposed business intelligence as an umbrella term to describe concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact based support systems 2 it was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread 5 edit business intelligence and data warehousing often bi applications use data gathered from a data warehouse or a data mart however not all data warehouses are used for business intelligence nor do all business intelligence applications require a data warehouse to distinguish between the concepts of business intelligence and data warehouses forrester research often defines business intelligence in one of two ways using a broad definition business intelligence is a set of methodologies processes architectures and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic tactical and operational insights and decision making 6 when using this definition business intelligence also includes technologies such as data integration data quality data warehousing master data management text and content analytics and many others that the market sometimes lumps into the information management segment therefore forrester refers to data preparation and data usage as two separate but closely linked segments of the business intelligence architectural stack forrester defines the latter narrower business intelligence market as referring to just the top layers of the bi architectural stack such as reporting analytics and dashboards 7 edit business intelligence and business analytics thomas davenport argues that business intelligence should be divided into querying reporting olap an alerts tool and business analytics in this definition business analytics is the subset of bi based on statistics prediction and optimization 8 edit applications in an enterprise business intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes in order to drive business value citation needed measurement program that creates a hierarchy of performance metrics see also metrics reference model and benchmarking that informs business leaders about progress towards business goals business process management analytics program that builds quantitative processes for a business to arrive at optimal decisions and to perform business knowledge discovery frequently involves data mining process mining statistical analysis predictive analytics predictive modeling business process modeling complex event processing and prescriptive analytics reporting enterprise reporting program that builds infrastructure for strategic reporting to serve the strategic management of a business not operational reporting frequently involves data visualization executive information system and olap collaboration collaboration platform program that gets different areas both inside and outside the business to work together through data sharing and electronic data interchange knowledge management program to make the company data driven through strategies and practices to identify create represent distribute and enable adoption of insights and experiences that are true business knowledge knowledge management leads to learning management and regulatory compliance in addition to above business intelligence also can provide a pro active approach such as alarm function to alert immediately to end user there are many types of alerts for example if some business value exceeds the threshold value the color of that amount in the report will turn red and the business analyst is alerted sometimes an alert mail will be sent to the user as well this end to end process requires data governance which should be handled by the expert citation needed edit prioritization of business intelligence projects it is often difficult to provide a positive business case for business intelligence initiatives and often the projects must be prioritized through strategic initiatives here are some hints to increase the benefits for a bi project as described by kimball 9 you must determine the tangible benefits such as eliminated cost of producing legacy reports enforce access to data for the entire organization 10 in this way even a small benefit such as a few minutes saved makes a difference when multiplied by the number of employees in the entire organization as described by ross weil amp roberson for enterprise architecture 11 consider letting the bi project be driven by other business initiatives with excellent business cases to support this approach the organization must have enterprise architects who can identify suitable business projects edit success factors of implementation before implementing a bi solution it is worth taking different factors into consideration before proceeding according to kimball et al these are the three critical areas that you need to assess within your organization before getting ready to do a bi project 12 the level of commitment and sponsorship of the project from senior management the level of business need for creating a bi implementation the amount and quality of business data available edit business sponsorship the commitment and sponsorship of senior management is according to kimball et al the most important criteria for assessment 13 this is because having strong management backing helps overcome shortcomings elsewhere in the project however as kimball et al state even the most elegantly designed dw bi system cannot overcome a lack of business management sponsorship 14 it is important that management personnel who participate in the project have a vision and an idea of the benefits and drawbacks of implementing a bi system the best business sponsor should have organizational clout and should be well connected within the organization it is ideal that the business sponsor is demanding but also able to be realistic and supportive if the implementation runs into delays or drawbacks the management sponsor also needs to be able to assume accountability and to take responsibility for failures and setbacks on the project support from multiple members of the management ensures the project does not fail if one person leaves the steering group however having many managers work together on the project can also mean that there are several different interests that attempt to pull the project in different directions such as if different departments want to put more emphasis on their usage this issue can be countered by an early and specific analysis of the business areas that benefit the most from the implementation all stakeholders in project should participate in this analysis in order for them to feel ownership of the project and to find common ground another management problem that should be encountered before start of implementation is if the business sponsor is overly aggressive if the management individual gets carried away by the possibilities of using bi and starts wanting the dw or bi implementation to include several different sets of data that were not included in the original planning phase however since extra implementations of extra data may add many months to the original plan it s wise to make sure the person from management is aware of his actions edit business needs because of the close relationship with senior management another critical thing that must be assessed before the project begins is whether or not there is a business need and whether there is a clear business benefit by doing the implementation 15 the needs and benefits of the implementation are sometimes driven by competition and the need to gain an advantage in the market another reason for a business driven approach to implementation of bi is the acquisition of other organizations that enlarge the original organization it can sometimes be beneficial to implement dw or bi in order to create more oversight companies that implement bi are often large multinational organizations with diverse subsidiaries 16 a well designed bi solution provides a consolidated view of key business data not available anywhere else in the organization giving management visibility and control over measures that otherwise would not exist edit amount and quality of available data without good data it does not matter how good the management sponsorship or business driven motivation is without proper data or with too little quality data any bi implementation fails before implementation it is a good idea to do data profiling this analysis identifies the content consistency and structure 15 of the data this should be done as early as possible in the process and if the analysis shows that data is lacking put the project on the shelf temporarily while the it department figures out how to properly collect data when planning for business data and business intelligence requirements it is always advisable to consider specific scenarios that apply to a particular organization and then select the business intelligence features best suited for the scenario often scenarios revolve around distinct business processes each built on one or more data sources these sources are used by features that present that data as information to knowledge workers who subsequently act on that information the business needs of the organization for each business process adopted correspond to the essential steps of business intelligence these essential steps of business intelligence includes but not limited to go through business data sources in order to collect needed data convert business data to information and present appropriately query and analyze data act on those data collected edit user aspect some considerations must be made in order to successfully integrate the usage of business intelligence systems in a company ultimately the bi system must be accepted and utilized by the users in order for it to add value to the organization 17 18 if the usability of the system is poor the users may become frustrated and spend a considerable amount of time figuring out how to use the system or may not be able to really use the system if the system does not add value to the users mission they simply don t use it 18 to increase user acceptance of a bi system it can be advisable to consult business users at an early stage of the dw bi lifecycle for example at the requirements gathering phase 17 this can provide an insight into the business process and what the users need from the bi system there are several methods for gathering this information such as questionnaires and interview sessions when gathering the requirements from the business users the local it department should also be consulted in order to determine to which degree it is possible to fulfill the business s needs based on the available data 17 taking on a user centered approach throughout the design and development stage may further increase the chance of rapid user adoption of the bi system 18 besides focusing on the user experience offered by the bi applications it may also possibly motivate the users to utilize the system by adding an element of competition kimball 17 suggests implementing a function on the business intelligence portal website where reports on system usage can be found by doing so managers can see how well their departments are doing and compare themselves to others and this may spur them to encourage their staff to utilize the bi system even more in a 2007 article h j watson gives an example of how the competitive element can act as an incentive 19 watson describes how a large call centre implemented performance dashboards for all call agents with monthly incentive bonuses tied to performance metrics also agents could compare their performance to other team members the implementation of this type of performance measurement and competition significantly improved agent performance bi chances of success can be improved by involving senior management to help make bi a part of the organizational culture and by providing the users with necessary tools training and support 19 training encourages more people to use the bi application 17 providing user support is necessary to maintain the bi system and resolve user problems 18 user support can be incorporated in many ways for example by creating a website the website should contain great content and tools for finding the necessary information furthermore helpdesk support can be used the help desk can be manned by power users or the dw bi project team 17 edit marketplace there are a number of business intelligence vendors often categorized into the remaining independent pure play vendors and consolidated megavendors that have entered the market through a recent trend when of acquisitions in the bi industry 20 some companies adopting bi software decide to pick and choose from different product offerings best of breed rather than purchase one comprehensive integrated solution full service 21 edit industry specific specific considerations for business intelligence systems have to be taken in some sectors such as governmental banking regulations the information collected by banking institutions and analyzed with bi software must be protected from some groups or individuals while being fully available to other groups or individuals therefore bi solutions must be sensitive to those needs and be flexible enough to adapt to new regulations and changes to existing law edit semi structured or unstructured data businesses create a huge amount of valuable information in the form of e mails memos notes from call centers news user groups chats reports web pages presentations image files video files and marketing material and news according to merrill lynch more than 85 of all business information exists in these forms these information types are called either semi structured or unstructured data however organizations often only use these documents once 22 the management of semi structured data is recognized as a major unsolved problem in the information technology industry 23 according to projections from gartner 2003 white collar workers spend anywhere from 30 to 40 percent of their time searching finding and assessing unstructured data bi uses both structured and unstructured data but the former is easy to search and the latter contains a large quantity of the information needed for analysis and decision making 23 24 because of the difficulty of properly searching finding and assessing unstructured or semi structured data organizations may not draw upon these vast reservoirs of information which could influence a particular decision task or project this can ultimately lead to poorly informed decision making 22 therefore when designing a business intelligence dw solution the specific problems associated with semi structured and unstructured data must be accommodated for as well as those for the structured data 24 edit unstructured data vs semi structured data unstructured and semi structured data have different meanings depending on their context in the context of relational database systems unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered columns and rows one type of unstructured data is typically stored in a blob binary large object a catch all data type available in most relational database management systems unstructured data may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated column patterns that vary from row to row within each file or document many of these data types however like e mails word processing text files ppts image files and video files conform to a standard that offers the possibility of metadata metadata can include information such as author and time of creation and this can be stored in a relational database therefore it may be more accurate to talk about this as semi structured documents or data 23 but no specific consensus seems to have been reached unstructured data can also simply be the knowledge that business users have about future business trends business forecasting naturally aligns with the bi system because business users think of their business in aggregate terms capturing the business knowledge that may only exist in the minds of business users provides some of the most important data points for a complete bi solution edit problems with semi structured or unstructured data there are several challenges to developing bi with semi structured data according to inmon amp nesavich 25 some of those are physically accessing unstructured textual data unstructured data is stored in a huge variety of formats terminology among researchers and analysts there is a need to develop a standardized terminology volume of data as stated earlier up to 85 of all data exists as semi structured data couple that with the need for word to word and semantic analysis searchability of unstructured textual data a simple search on some data e g apple results in links where there is a reference to that precise search term inmon amp nesavich 2008 25 gives an example a search is made on the term felony in a simple search the term felony is used and everywhere there is a reference to felony a hit to an unstructured document is made but a simple search is crude it does not find references to crime arson murder embezzlement vehicular homicide and such even though these crimes are types of felonies edit the use of metadata to solve problems with searchability and assessment of data it is necessary to know something about the content this can be done by adding context through the use of metadata 22 many systems already capture some metadata e g filename author size etc but more useful would be metadata about the actual content e g summaries topics people or companies mentioned two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and information extraction edit future a 2009 gartner paper predicted 26 these developments in the business intelligence market because of lack of information processes and tools through 2012 more than 35 percent of the top 5 000 global companies regularly fail to make insightful decisions about significant changes in their business and markets by 2012 business units will control at least 40 percent of the total budget for business intelligence by 2012 one third of analytic applications applied to business processes will be delivered through coarse grained application mashups a 2009 information management special report predicted the top bi trends green computing social networking data visualization mobile bi predictive analytics composite applications cloud computing and multitouch 27 other business intelligence trends include the following 28 third party soa bi products increasingly address etl issues of volume and throughput cloud computing and software as a service saas are ubiquitous companies embrace in memory processing 64 bit processing and pre packaged analytic bi applications operational applications have callable bi components with improvements in response time scaling and concurrency near or real time bi analytics is a baseline expectation open source bi software replaces vendor offerings other lines of research include the combined study of business intelligence and uncertain data 29 30 in this context the data used is not assumed to be precise accurate and complete instead data is considered uncertain and therefore this uncertainty is propagated to the results produced by bi according to a study by the aberdeen group there has been increasing interest in software as a service saas business intelligence over the past years with twice as many organizations using this deployment approach as one year ago 15 in 2009 compared to 7 in 2008 citation needed an article by infoworld s chris kanaracus points out similar
