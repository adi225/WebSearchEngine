science real time computing rtc or reactive computing is the study of hardware and software systems that are subject to a real time constraint e g operational deadlines from event to system response real time programs must guarantee response within strict time constraints 1 often real time response times are understood to be in the order of milliseconds and sometimes microseconds in contrast a non real time system is one that cannot guarantee a response time in any situation even if a fast response is the usual result the use of this word should not be confused with the two other legitimate uses of real time in the domain of simulations the term means that the simulation s clock runs as fast as a real clock would and in the domain of data transfer media processing and enterprise systems the term is used to mean without perceivable delay real time software may use one or more of the following synchronous programming languages real time operating systems and real time networks each of which provide essential frameworks on which to build a real time software application a real time system may be one where its application can be considered within context to be mission critical the anti lock brakes on a car are a simple example of a real time computing system the real time constraint in this system is the time in which the brakes must be released to prevent the wheel from locking real time computations can be said to have failed if they are not completed before their deadline where their deadline is relative to an event a real time deadline must be met regardless of

process is simulated at a rate that matched that of the real process now called real time simulation to avoid ambiguity analog computers most often were capable of simulating at a much faster pace than real time a situation that could be just as dangerous as a slow simulation if it were not also recognized and accounted for once when the mos technology 6502 used in the commodore 64 and apple ii and later when the motorola 68000 used in the macintosh atari st and commodore amiga were popular anybody could use their home computer as a real time system the possibility to deactivate other interrupts allowed for hard coded loops with defined timing the low interrupt latency allowed the implementation of a real time operating system giving the user interface and the disk drives lower priority than the real time thread compared to these the programmable interrupt controller of the intel cpus 8086 80586 generates a very large latency and the windows operating system is neither a real time operating system nor does it allow a program to take over the cpu completely and use its own scheduler without using native machine language and thus surpassing all interrupting windows code however several coding libraries exist which offer real time capabilities in a high level language on a variety of operating systems for example java real time the motorola 68000 and subsequent family members 68010 68020 etc also became popular with manufacturers of industrial control systems thanks to this facility this application area is one in which real time control offers genuine advantages in terms of process performance and safety edit criteria for real time computing a system is said to be real time if the total correctness of an operation depends not only upon its logical correctness but also upon the time in which it is performed real time systems as well as their deadlines are classified by the consequence of missing a deadline hard missing a deadline is a total system failure firm infrequent deadline misses are tolerable but may degrade the system s quality of service the usefulness of a result is zero after its deadline soft the usefulness of a result degrades after its deadline thereby degrading the system s quality of service thus the goal of a hard real time system is to ensure that all deadlines are met but for soft real time systems the goal becomes meeting a certain subset of deadlines in order to optimize some application specific criteria the particular criteria optimized depends on the application but some typical examples include maximizing the number of deadlines met minimizing the lateness of tasks and maximizing the number of high priority tasks meeting their deadlines hard real time systems are used when it is imperative that an event be reacted to within a strict deadline such strong guarantees are required of systems for which not reacting in a certain interval of time would cause great loss in some manner especially damaging the surroundings physically or threatening human lives although the strict definition is simply that missing the deadline constitutes failure of the system for example a car engine control system is a hard real time system because a delayed signal may cause engine failure or damage other examples of hard real time embedded systems include medical systems such as heart pacemakers and industrial process controllers hard real time systems are typically found interacting at a low level with physical hardware in embedded systems early video game systems such as the atari 2600 and cinematronics vector graphics had hard real time requirements because of the nature of the graphics and timing hardware in the context of multitasking systems the scheduling policy is normally priority driven pre emptive schedulers other scheduling algorithms include earliest deadline first which ignoring the overhead of context switching is sufficient for system loads of less than 100 2 new overlay scheduling systems such as an adaptive partition scheduler assist in managing large systems with a mixture of hard real time and non real time applications soft real time systems are typically used where there is some issue of concurrent access and the need to keep a number of connected systems up to date with changing situations for example software that maintains and updates the flight plans for commercial airliners the flight plans must be kept reasonably current but can operate to a latency of seconds live audio video systems are also usually soft real time violation of constraints results in degraded quality but the system can continue to operate edit real time in digital signal processing in a real time dsp process the analyzed input and generated output samples can be processed or generated continuously in the time it takes to input and output the same set of samples independent of the processing delay 3 it means that the processing delay must be bounded even if the processing continues for an unlimited time that means that the average processing time per sample is no greater than the sampling period which is the reciprocal of the sampling rate this is the criterion whether the samples are grouped together in large segments and processed in blocks or are processed individually and whether there are long short or non existent input and output buffers consider an audio dsp example if a process requires 2 01 seconds to analyze synthesize or process 2 00 seconds of sound it is not real time if it takes 1 99 seconds it is or can be made into a real time dsp process a common life analog is standing in a line or queue waiting for the checkout in a grocery store if the line asymptotically grows longer and longer without bound the checkout process is not real time if the length of the line is bounded customers are being processed and output as rapidly on average as they are being inputted and that process is real time the grocer might go out of business or must at least lose business if he she cannot make his her checkout process real time so it s fundamentally important that this process be real time a signal processing algorithm that cannot keep up with the flow of input data with output falling farther and farther behind the input is not real time but if the delay of the output relative to the input is bounded during a process that operates over an unlimited time then that signal processing algorithm is real time even if the throughput delay may be very long edit real time and high performance real time computing is sometimes misunderstood to be high performance computing but this is not always the case for example a massive supercomputer executing a scientific simulation may offer impressive performance yet it is not executing a real time computation conversely once the hardware and software for an anti lock braking system has been designed to meet its required deadlines no further performance gains are obligatory furthermore if a network server is highly loaded with network traffic its response time may be slower but will in most cases still succeed before it times out hits its deadline hence such a network server would not be considered a real time system temporal failures delays time outs etc are typically small and compartmentalized limited in effect but are not catastrophic failures in a real time system such as the ftse 100 index a slow down beyond limits would often be considered catastrophic in its application context therefore the most important requirement of a real time system is predictability and not performance some kinds of software such as many chess playing programs can fall into either category for instance a chess program designed to play in a tournament with a clock will need to decide on a move before a certain deadline or lose the game and is therefore a real time computation but a chess program that is allowed to run indefinitely before moving is not in both of these cases however high performance is desirable the more work a tournament chess program can do in the allotted time the better its moves will be and the faster an unconstrained chess program runs the sooner it will be able to move this example also illustrates the essential difference between real time computations and other computations if the tournament chess program does not make a decision about its next move in its allotted time it loses the game i e it fails as a real time computation while in the other scenario meeting the deadline is assumed not to be necessary high performance is indicative of the amount of processing that is performed in a given amount of time while real time is the ability to get done with the processing to yield a useful output in the available time edit design methods several methods exist to aid the design of real time systems an example of which is mascot an old but very successful method which represents the concurrent structure of the system other examples are
