regime in chile censorship is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectionable harmful sensitive or inconvenient as determined by a government media outlet or other controlling body it can be done by governments and private organizations or by individuals who engage in self censorship it occurs in a variety of different contexts including speech books music films and other arts the press radio television and the internet for a variety of reasons including national security to control obscenity child pornography and hate speech to protect children to promote or restrict political or religious views and to prevent slander and libel it may or may not be legal many countries provide strong protections against censorship by law but none of these protections are absolute and it is frequently necessary to balance conflicting rights in order to determine what can and cannot be censored contents 1 history 2 rationale 3 types 3 1 political 3 2

although this probably dates back over 100 000 years to the initial development of language it has been suggested that the first recorded censorship occurred briefly after the invention of writing with the removal of siduri s advice from the epic of gilgamesh 1 although it is unclear if this was a direct act of censorship or if the advice was removed for other reasons a more definitive case of ancient censorship occurred with socrates who was sentenced to drink poison in 399 bc for promoting his philosophies the struggle for freedom of expression is as ancient as the history of censorship the playwright euripides 480 406 bc defended the true liberty of freeborn men the right to speak freely 2 and the struggle for freedom has throughout history been largely defined as a struggle against censorship edit rationale the rationale for censorship is different for various types of information censored moral censorship is the removal of materials that are obscene or otherwise considered morally questionable pornography for example is often censored under this rationale especially child pornography which is illegal and censored in most jurisdictions in the world 3 4 military censorship is the process of keeping military intelligence and tactics confidential and away from the enemy this is used to counter espionage which is the process of gleaning military information political censorship occurs when governments hold back information from their citizens this is often done to exert control over the populace and prevent free expression that might foment rebellion religious censorship is the means by which any material considered objectionable by a certain faith is removed this often involves a dominant religion forcing limitations on less prevalent ones alternatively one religion may shun the works of another when they believe the content is not appropriate for their faith corporate censorship is the process by which editors in corporate media outlets intervene to disrupt the publishing of information that portrays their business or business partners in a negative light 5 6 or intervene to prevent alternate offers from reaching public exposure 7 edit types edit political nikolai yezhov standing to the left of joseph stalin was shot in 1940 he was edited out of the photo by soviet censors after his execution as a form of damnatio memoriae 8 this policy was commonly applied to high ranking executed political enemies during stalin s reign main article political censorship see also eastern bloc information dissemination censorship in cuba censorship in the people s republic of china 160 and censorship in north korea strict censorship existed in the eastern bloc 9 throughout the bloc the various ministries of culture held a tight rein on their writers 10 cultural products there reflected the propaganda needs of the state 10 party approved censors exercised strict control in the early years 11 in the stalinist period even the weather forecasts were changed if they had the temerity to suggest that the sun might not shine on may day 11 under nicolae ceau escu in romania weather reports were doctored so that the temperatures were not seen to rise above or fall below the levels which dictated that work must stop 11 independent journalism did not exist in the soviet union until mikhail gorbachev became its leader all reporting was directed by the communist party or related organizations pravda the predominant newspaper in the soviet union had a monopoly foreign newspapers were available only if they were published by communist parties sympathetic to the soviet union possession and use of copying machines was tightly controlled in order to hinder production and distribution of samizdat illegal self published books and magazines possession of even a single samizdat manuscript such as a book by andrei sinyavsky was a serious crime which might involve a visit from the kgb another outlet for works which did not find favor with the authorities was publishing abroad the people s republic of china employs sophisticated censorship mechanisms referred to as the golden shield project to monitor the internet popular search engines such as baidu also remove politically sensitive search results 12 iraq under baathist saddam hussein had much the same techniques of press censorship as did romania under nicolae ceau escu but with greater potential violence citation needed cuban media is operated under the supervision of the communist party s department of revolutionary orientation which develops and coordinates propaganda strategies 13 connection to the internet is restricted and censored 14 censorship also takes place in capitalist nations such as uruguay in 1973 a military coup took power in uruguay and the state practiced censorship for example writer eduardo galeano was imprisoned and later was forced to flee his book open veins of latin america was banned by the right wing military government not only in uruguay but also in chile and argentina 15 critics of the campaign finance reform in the united states claim that this reform imposes widespread restrictions on political speech 16 17 edit state secrets and prevention of attention the rhodesia herald of september 21 1966 wiecz r wroc awia daily newspaper of wroc aw people s republic of poland march 20 21 1981 with censor intervention on first and last pages under the headlines co zdarzy o si w bydgoszczy what happened in bydgoszcz and pogotowie strajkowe w ca ym kraju country wide strike alert the censor had removed a section regarding the strike alert hence the workers in the printing house blanked out an official propaganda section the right hand page also includes a hand written confirmation of that decision by the local solidarno trade union in wartime explicit censorship is carried out with the intent of preventing the release of information that might be useful to an enemy typically it involves keeping times or locations secret or delaying the release of information e g an operational objective until it is of no possible use to enemy forces the moral issues here are often seen as somewhat different as the proponents of this form of censorship argues that release of tactical information usually presents a greater risk of casualties among one s own forces and could possibly lead to loss of the overall conflict during world war i letters written by british soldiers would have to go through censorship this consisted of officers going through letters with a black marker and crossing out anything which might compromise operational secrecy before the letter was sent the world war ii catchphrase loose lips sink ships was used as a common justification to exercise official wartime censorship and encourage individual restraint when sharing potentially sensitive information an example of sanitization policies comes from the ussr under joseph stalin where publicly used photographs were often altered to remove people whom stalin had condemned to execution though past photographs may have been remembered or kept this deliberate and systematic alteration to all of history in the public mind is seen as one of the central themes of stalinism and totalitarianism censorship is occasionally carried out to aid authorities or to protect an individual as with some kidnappings when attention and media coverage of the victim can sometimes be seen as unhelpful 18 19 edit religion main article censorship by religion censorship by religion is a form of censorship where freedom of expression is controlled or limited using religious authority or on the basis of the teachings of the religion this form of censorship has a long history and is practiced in many societies and by many religions examples include the galileo affair edict of compi gne the index librorum prohibitorum list of prohibited books and the condemnation of salman rushdie s novel the satanic verses by iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini edit educational sources historic russian censorship book notes of my life by n i grech published in st petersburg 1886 by a s suvorin the censored text was replaced by dots the content of school textbooks is often the issue of debate since their target audience is young people and the term whitewashing is the one commonly used to refer to removal of critical or conflicting events the reporting of military atrocities in history is extremely controversial as in the case of the holocaust or holocaust denial bombing of dresden the nanking massacre as found with japanese history textbook controversies the armenian genocide the tiananmen square protests of 1989 and the winter soldier investigation of the vietnam war in the context of secondary school education the way facts and history are presented greatly influences the interpretation of contemporary thought opinion and socialization one argument for censoring the type of information disseminated is based on the inappropriate quality of such material for the young the use of the inappropriate distinction is in itself controversial as it changed heavily a ballantine books version of the book fahrenheit 451 which is the version used by most school classes 20 contained approximately 75 separate edits omissions and changes from the original bradbury manuscript in february 2006 a national geographic magazine cover was censored by the nashravaran journalistic institute the offending cover was about the subject of love and a picture of an embracing couple was hidden beneath a white sticker 21 21 edit copy picture and writer approval copy approval is the right to read and amend an article usually an interview before publication many publications refuse to give copy approval but it is increasingly becoming common practice when dealing with publicity anxious celebrities 22 picture approval is the right given to an individual to choose which photos will be published and which will not robert redford is well known for insisting upon picture approval 23 writer approval is when writers are chosen based on whether they will write flattering articles or not hollywood publicist pat kingsley is known for banning certain writers who wrote undesirably about one of her clients from interviewing any of her other clients citation needed edit creative censorship there are many ways that censors exhibit creativity but a specific variant is of concern in which censors rewrite texts giving these texts secret co authors this form of censorship is discussed in george orwell s novel nineteen eighty four citation needed original research edit self censorship author ozzie zehner self censored the american edition of his environmental book green illusions due to food libel laws that enable the food industry to sue researchers who criticize their products main article self censorship according to a pew research center and the columbia journalism review survey about one quarter of the local and national journalists say they have purposely avoided newsworthy stories while nearly as many acknowledge they have softened the tone of stories to benefit the interests of their news organizations fully four in ten 41 admit they have engaged in either or both of these practices 24 edit censorship by medium edit books main article book censorship nazi book burning in berlin may 1933 book censorship can be enacted at the national or sub national level and can carry legal penalties for their infraction books may also be challenged at a local community level as a result books can be removed from schools or libraries although these bans do not extend outside of that area edit films main article film censorship aside from the usual justifications of pornography and obscenity some films are censored due to changing racial attitudes or political correctness in order to avoid ethnic stereotyping and or ethnic offense despite its historical or artistic value one example is the still withdrawn censored eleven series of animated cartoons which may have been innocent then but are incorrect now edit music main article censorship of music music censorship has been implemented by states religions educational systems families retailers and lobbying groups and in most cases they violate international conventions of human rights 25 edit maps main article censorship of maps censorship of maps is often employed for military purposes for example the technique was used in former east germany especially for the areas near the border to west germany in order to make attempts of defection more difficult censorship of maps is also applied by google maps where certain areas are grayed out or blacked or areas are purposely left outdated with old imagery 26 edit internet main article internet censorship internet censorship by country 27 28 29 160 160 pervasive censorship 160 160 substantial censorship 160 160 selective

internet it may be carried out by governments or by private organizations either at the behest of government or on their own initiative individuals and organizations may engage in self censorship on their own or due to intimidation and fear the issues associated with internet censorship are similar to those for offline censorship of more traditional media one difference is that national borders are more permeable online residents of a country that bans certain information can find it on websites hosted outside the country thus censors must work to prevent access to information even though they lack physical or legal control over the websites themselves this in turn requires the use of technical censorship methods that are unique to the internet such as site blocking and content filtering 30 unless the censor has total control over all internet connected computers such as in north korea or cuba total censorship of information is very difficult or impossible to achieve due to the underlying distributed technology of the internet pseudonymity and data havens such as freenet protect free speech using technologies that guarantee material cannot be removed and prevents the identification of authors technologically savvy users can often find ways to access blocked content nevertheless blocking remains an effective means of limiting access to sensitive information for most users when censors such as those in china are able to devote significant resources to building and maintaining a comprehensive censorship system 30 views about the feasibility and effectiveness of internet censorship have evolved in parallel with the development of the internet and censorship technologies a 1993 time magazine article quotes computer scientist john gillmore one of the founders of the electronic frontier foundation as saying the net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it 31 in november 2007 father of the internet vint cerf stated that he sees government control of the internet failing because the web is almost entirely privately owned 32 a report of research conducted in 2007 and published in 2009 by the beckman center for internet amp society at harvard university stated that we are confident that the censorship circumvention tool developers will for the most part keep ahead of the governments blocking efforts but also that we believe that less than two percent of all filtered internet users use circumvention tools 33 in contrast a 2011 report by researchers at the oxford internet institute published by unesco concludes the control of information on the internet and web is certainly feasible and technological advances do not therefore guarantee greater freedom of speech 30 a bbc world service poll of 27 973 adults in 26 countries including 14 306 internet users 34 was conducted between 30 november 2009 and 7 february 2010 the head of the polling organization felt overall that the poll showed that despite worries about privacy and fraud people around the world see access to the internet as their fundamental right they think the web is a force for good and most don t want governments to regulate it 35 the poll found that nearly four in five 78 internet users felt that the internet had brought them greater freedom that most internet users 53 felt that the internet should never be regulated by any level of government anywhere and almost four in five internet users and non users around the world felt that access to the internet was a fundamental right 50 strongly agreed 29 somewhat agreed 9 somewhat disagreed 6 strongly disagreed and 6 gave no opinion 36 edit implementation censored pre press proof of two articles from not cias da amadora a portuguese newspaper 1970 the former soviet union maintained a particularly extensive program of state imposed censorship the main organ for official censorship in the soviet union was the chief agency for protection of military and state secrets generally known as the glavlit its russian acronym the glavlit handled censorship matters arising from domestic writings of just about any kind even beer and vodka labels glavlit censorship personnel were present in every large soviet publishing house or newspaper the agency employed some 70 000 censors to review information before it was disseminated by publishing houses editorial offices and broadcasting studios no mass medium escaped glavlit s control all press agencies and radio and television stations had glavlit representatives on their editorial staffs sometimes a specific and unique information whose very existence is barely known to the public is kept in a subtle near censorship situation being regarded as subversive or inconvenient michel foucault s 1978 text sexual morality and the law later republished as the danger of child sexuality for instance originally published as la loi de la pudeur literally the law of decency defends the decriminalization of statutory rape and the abolition of age of consent laws when a publisher comes under pressure to suppress a book but has already entered into a contract with the author they will sometimes effectively censor the book by deliberately ordering a small print run and making minimal if any attempts to publicize it this practice became known in the early 2000s as privishing priv ate publ ishing 37 edit censorship by
