the acm headquarters in new york city acm is organized into over 170 local chapters and 35 special interest groups sigs through which it conducts most of its activities additionally there are over 500 college and university chapters the first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the university of louisiana at lafayette many of the sigs like siggraph sigplan sigcse and sigcomm sponsor regular conferences which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields the groups also publish a large number of specialized journals magazines and newsletters acm also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide acm international collegiate programming contest icpc and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between garry kasparov and the ibm deep blue computer edit services acm press publishes a prestigious citation needed academic journal journal of the acm and general magazines for computer professionals communications of the acm also known as communications or cacm and queue other publications of the acm include acm xrds formerly crossroads and renamed and designed in 2010 the most popular student computing magazine in the us acm interactions an interdisciplinary hci publication focused on the connections between experiences people and technology and the third largest acm publication 3 acm computing surveys csur a number of journals specific to subfields of computer science titled acm transactions some of the more notable transactions include acm transactions on computer systems tocs ieee acm transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics tcbb acm transactions on computational logic tocl acm transactions on computer human interaction tochi acm transactions on database systems tods acm transactions on graphics tog acm transactions on mathematical software toms acm transactions on multimedia computing communications and applications tomccap ieee acm transactions on networking ton acm transactions on programming languages and systems toplas although communications no longer publishes primary research and is not considered a prestigious venue many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages acm has made almost all of its publications available to paid subscribers online at its digital library and also has a guide to computing literature individual members additionally have access to safari books online and books24x7 the acm also offers insurance online courses and other services to its members edit digital library the acm digital library a part of the acm portal contains a comprehensive archive of the organization s journals magazines and conference proceedings online services include a forum called ubiquity and tech news digest acm requires the copyright of all submissions to be assigned to the organization as a condition of publishing the work 4 authors may post the documents on their own websites but they are required to link back to the digital library s reference page for the paper though authors are not allowed to charge for access to copies of their work downloading a copy from the acm site requires a paid subscription edit competition acm s primary historical competitor has been the ieee computer society which is the largest subgroup of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers the ieee focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical computer science but there is considerable overlap with acm s agenda they occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula 5 some of the major awards in computer science are given jointly by acm and the ieee cs 6 there is also a mounting challenge to the acm s publication practices coming from the open access movement some authors see a centralized peer review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like arxiv other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online such as journal of artificial intelligence research jair journal of machine learning research jmlr and the journal of research and practice in information technology edit membership grades in addition to student and regular members acm has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers 7 edit fellows see also category fellows of the association for computing machinery the acm fellows program was established by council of the association for computing machinery in 1993 to recognize and honor outstanding acm members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the acm there are presently about 500 fellows 8 out of about 60 000 professional members edit other membership grades in 2006 acm began recognizing two additional membership grades senior members have ten or more years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous acm membership distinguished engineers and distinguished scientists have at least 15 years of profession experience and 5 years of continuous acm membership and who have made a significant impact on the computing field edit chapters acm has three kinds of chapters special interest groups 9
