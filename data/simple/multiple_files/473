r paradigm s multi paradigm array object oriented imperative functional procedural reflective appeared in 1993 1 designed by ross ihaka and robert gentleman developer r development core team stable release 2 15 2 october 160 26 160 2012 3 months ago 160 2012 10 26 preview release through subversion typing discipline dynamic influenced by s scheme xlispstat os cross platform license gnu general public license website www r project org r programming at wikibooks r is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics the r language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software 2 3 and data analysis 3 polls and surveys of data miners are showing r s popularity has increased substantially in recent years 4 5 6 r is an implementation of the s programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics inspired by scheme s was created by john chambers while at bell labs r was created by ross ihaka and robert gentleman 7 at the university of auckland new zealand and now r is developed by the r development core team of which chambers is a member r is named partly after the first names of the first two r authors robert gentleman and ross ihaka and partly as a play on the name of s 8 r is a gnu project 9 10 the source code for the r software environment is written primarily in c fortran and r 11 r is freely available under the gnu general public license and pre compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems r uses a command line interface however several graphical user interfaces are available for use with r contents 1 statistical features 2 programming features 3 examples 3 1 example 1 3 2 example 2 4 packages 4 1 speed up and memory efficiency 5 milestones 6 interfaces 6 1 graphical user interfaces 6 2 editors and ides 6 3 scripting languages 7 user conferences 8 comparison with sas spss and stata 9 commercial support for r 10 see also 11 references 12 external links edit statistical features r provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques including linear and nonlinear modeling classical statistical tests time series analysis classification clustering and others r is easily extensible through functions and extensions and the r community is noted for its active contributions in terms of packages there are some important differences but much code written for s runs unaltered many of r s standard functions are written in r itself which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made for computationally intensive tasks c c and fortran code can be linked and called at run time advanced users can write c or java 12 code to manipulate r objects directly r is highly extensible through the use of user submitted packages for specific functions or specific areas of study due to its s heritage r has stronger object oriented programming facilities than most statistical computing languages extending r is also eased by its lexical scoping rules 13 another strength of r is static graphics which can produce publication quality graphs including mathematical symbols dynamic and interactive graphics are available through additional packages 14 r has its own latex like documentation format which is used to supply comprehensive documentation both on line in a number of formats and in hard copy edit programming features r is an interpreted language typically used through a command line interpreter if a user types 2 2 at the command prompt and presses enter the computer replies with 4 as shown below gt 2 2 1 4 like many other languages r supports matrix arithmetic r s data structures include scalars vectors matrices data frames similar to tables in a relational database and lists 15 the r object system is extensible and includes objects for among others regression models time series and geo spatial coordinates r supports procedural programming with functions and for some functions object oriented programming with generic functions a generic function acts differently depending on the type of arguments it is passed in other words the generic function dispatches the function method specific to that type of object for example r has a generic print function that can print almost every type of object in r with a simple print objectname syntax although r is mostly used by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development it can also be used as a general matrix calculation toolbox with performance benchmarks comparable to gnu octave or matlab 16 edit examples edit example 1 the following examples illustrate the basic syntax of the language and use of the command line interface in r the widely

created packages which allow specialized statistical techniques graphical devices import export capabilities reporting tools etc these packages are developed primarily in r and sometimes in java c and fortran a core set of packages are included with the installation of r with 5300 additional packages as of april 2012 update available at the comprehensive r archive network cran bioconductor and other repositories 22 the task views page subject list on the cran website lists the wide range of applications finance genetics machine learning medical imaging social sciences and spatial statistics to which r has been applied and for which packages are available other r package resources include crantastic a community site for rating and reviewing all cran packages and also r forge a central platform for the collaborative development of r packages r related software and projects it hosts many unpublished beta packages and development versions of cran packages the bioconductor project provides r packages for the analysis of genomic data such as affymetrix and cdna microarray object oriented data handling and analysis tools and has started to provide tools for analysis of data from next generation high throughput sequencing methods reproducible research and automated report generation can be accomplished with packages that support execution of r code embedded within latex opendocument format and other markups 23 edit speed up and memory efficiency there is a package jit which provides jit compilation and another package compiler which offers a byte code compiler for r 24 there are several packages snow multicore parallel which provide parallelism for r 1 there ff package saves memory by storing data on disk the data structures behave as if they were in ram 2 the package ffbase provides basic statistical functions for ff edit milestones the full list of changes is maintained in the news file some highlights are listed below version 0 16 160 this is the last

general consensus is that r compares well with other popular statistical packages such as sas spss and stata 42 in january 2009 the new york times ran an article about r gaining acceptance among data analysts and presenting a potential threat for the market share occupied by commercial statistical packages such as sas 43 edit commercial support for r in 2007 revolution analytics was founded to provide commercial support for revolution r its distribution of r which also includes components developed by the company major additional components include parallelr the r productivity environment ide revoscaler for big data analysis revodeployr web services framework and the ability for reading and writing data in the sas file format 44 in october 2011 oracle announced the big data appliance which integrates r apache hadoop oracle enterprise linux and a nosql database with the exadata hardware 45 46 47 oracle r enterprise 48 is now one of two components of the oracle advanced analytics
