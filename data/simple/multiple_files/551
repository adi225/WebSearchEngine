the boolean model of information retrieval bir 1 is a classical information retrieval ir model and at the same time the first and most adopted one it is used by virtually all commercial ir systems today citation needed contents 1 definitions 2 example 3 advantages 4 disadvantages 5 data structures and algorithms 5 1 hash sets 6 references edit definitions the bir is based on boolean logic and classical set theory in that both the documents to be searched and the user s query are conceived as sets of terms retrieval is based on whether or not the documents contain the query terms given a finite set t t1 t2 tj tm of elements called index terms e g words or expressions which may be stemmed describing or characterising documents such as keywords given for a journal article a finite set d d1 di dn where di is an element of the powerset of t of elements called documents given a boolean expression in a normal form q called a query as follows q wi or wk or and and wj or ws or with wi ti wk tk wj tj ws ts or wi non ti wk non tk wj non tj ws nonts where ti means that the term ti is present in document di whereas non ti means that it is not equivalently q can be given in a disjunctive normal form too an operation called retrieval consisting of two steps is defined as follows 1 the sets sj of documents are obtained that contain or not term tj depending on whether wj tj or wj non tj 160 sj di wj element of di 2 those documents are retrieved in response to q which are the result of the corresponding sets operations i e the answer to q is as follows union intersection sj edit example let the set of original real documents be for example o o1 o2 o3 where o1 bayes principle the principle that in estimating a parameter one should initially assume that each possible value has equal probability a uniform prior distribution o2 bayesian decision theory a mathematical theory of decision making which presumes utility and probability functions and according to which the act to be chosen is the bayes act i e the one with highest subjective expected utility if one had unlimited time and calculating power with which to make every decision this procedure would be the best way to make any decision o3 bayesian epistemology a philosophical theory which holds that the epistemic status of a proposition i e how well proven or well established it is is best measured by a probability and that the proper way to revise this probability is given by bayesian conditionalisation or similar procedures a bayesian epistemologist would use probability to define and explore the relationship between concepts such as epistemic status support or explanatory power let the set t of terms be t t1 bayes principle t2 probability t3 decision making t4 bayesian epistemology then the set d of documents is as follows d d1 d2 d3 where d1 bayes principle probability d2 probability decision making d3 probability bayesian epistemology let the query q be q probability and decision making 1 firstly the following sets s1 and s2 of documents di are obtained retrieved s1 d1 d2 d3 s2 d2 2 finally the following documents di are retrieved in response to q d1 d2 d3 intersection d2 d2 this means that the original document o2 corresponding to d2 is the answer to q obviously if there is more than one document with the same representation every such document is retrieved such documents are in the bir indistinguishable or in other words equivalent edit advantages clean formalism easy to implement intuitive concept edit disadvantages exact matching may retrieve too few or too many documents difficult to rank output some documents are more important than others hard to translate a query into a boolean expression all terms are equally weighted more like data retrieval than information retrieval edit data structures and algorithms from a pure formal mathematical point of view the bir is straightforward from a practical point of view however several further problems should be solved that relate to algorithms and data structures such as for example the choice of terms manual or automatic selection or both stemming hash tables inverted file structure and so on 2 edit hash sets another possibility is to use hash sets each document is represented by a hash table which contains every single term of that document since hash table size increases and decreases in real time with the addition and removal of terms each document will occupy much less space in memory however it will have a slowdown in performance because the operations are more complex than with bit vectors on the worst case performance can degrade from o n to o n 2 on the average case the performance slowdown will not be that much worse than bit vectors and the space usage is much more
