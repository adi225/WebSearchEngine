computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses principles of computer science to assist in solving chemical problems it uses the results of theoretical chemistry incorporated into efficient computer programs to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids its necessity arises from the well known fact that apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion see references therein for more details the quantum n body problem cannot be solved analytically much less in closed form while its results normally complement the information obtained by chemical experiments it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical phenomena it is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials examples of such properties are structure i e the expected positions of the constituent atoms absolute and relative interaction energies electronic charge distributions dipoles and higher multipole moments vibrational frequencies reactivity or other spectroscopic quantities and cross sections for collision with other particles the methods employed cover both static and dynamic situations in all cases the computer time and other resources such as memory and disk space increase rapidly with the size of the system being studied that system can be a single molecule a group of molecules or a solid computational chemistry methods range from highly accurate to very approximate highly accurate methods are typically feasible only for small systems ab initio methods are based entirely on theory from first principles other typically less accurate methods are called empirical or semi empirical because they employ experimental results often from acceptable models of atoms or related molecules to approximate some elements of the underlying theory both ab initio and semi empirical approaches involve approximations these range from simplified forms of the first principles equations that are easier or faster to solve to approximations limiting the size of the system for example periodic boundary conditions to fundamental approximations to the underlying equations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all for example most ab initio calculations make the born oppenheimer approximation which greatly simplifies the underlying schr dinger equation by assuming that the nuclei remain in place during the calculation in principle ab initio methods eventually converge to the exact solution of the underlying equations as the number of approximations is reduced in practice however it is impossible to eliminate all approximations and residual error inevitably remains the goal of computational chemistry is to minimize this residual error while keeping the calculations tractable in some cases the details of electronic structure are less important than the long time phase space behavior of molecules this is the case in conformational studies of proteins and protein ligand binding thermodynamics classical approximations to the potential energy surface are employed as they are computationally less intensive than electronic calculations to enable longer simulations of molecular dynamics furthermore cheminformatics uses even more empirical and computationally cheaper methods like machine learning based on physicochemical properties one typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict the binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target contents 1 history 2 fields of application 3 accuracy 4 methods 4 1 ab initio methods 4 2 density functional methods 4 3 semi empirical and

theoretical calculations in chemistry were those of walter heitler and fritz london in 1927 the books that were influential in the early development of computational quantum chemistry include linus pauling and e bright wilson s 1935 introduction to quantum mechanics with applications to chemistry eyring walter and kimball s 1944 quantum chemistry heitler s 1945 elementary wave mechanics with applications to quantum chemistry and later coulson s 1952 textbook valence each of which served as primary references for chemists in the decades to follow with the development of efficient computer technology in the 1940s the solutions of elaborate wave equations for complex atomic systems began to be a realizable objective in the early 1950s the first semi empirical atomic orbital calculations were carried out theoretical chemists became extensive users of the early digital computers a very detailed account of such use in the united kingdom is given by smith and sutcliffe 1 the first ab initio hartree fock calculations on diatomic molecules were carried out in 1956 at mit using a basis set of slater orbitals for diatomic molecules a systematic study using a minimum basis set and the first calculation with a larger basis set were published by ransil and nesbet respectively in 1960 2 the first polyatomic calculations using gaussian orbitals were carried out in the late 1950s the first configuration interaction calculations were carried out in cambridge on the edsac computer in the 1950s using gaussian orbitals by boys and coworkers 3 by 1971 when a bibliography of ab initio calculations was published 4 the largest molecules included were naphthalene and azulene 5 6 abstracts of many earlier developments in ab initio theory have been published by schaefer 7 in 1964 h ckel method calculations using a simple linear combination of atomic orbitals lcao method for the determination of electron energies of molecular orbitals of electrons in conjugated hydrocarbon systems of molecules ranging in complexity from butadiene and benzene to ovalene were generated on computers at berkeley and oxford 8 these empirical methods were replaced in the 1960s by semi empirical methods such as cndo 9 in the early 1970s efficient ab initio computer programs such as atmol gaussian ibmol and polyaytom began to be used to speed up ab initio calculations of molecular orbitals of these four programs only gaussian now massively expanded is still in use but many other programs are now in use at the same time the methods of molecular mechanics such as mm2 were developed primarily by norman allinger 10 one of the first mentions of the term computational chemistry can be found in the 1970 book computers and their role in the physical sciences by sidney fernbach and abraham haskell taub where they state it seems therefore that computational chemistry can finally be more and more of a reality 11 during the 1970s widely different methods began to be seen as part of a new emerging discipline of computational chemistry 12 the journal of computational chemistry was first published in 1980 edit fields of application the term theoretical chemistry may be defined as a mathematical description of chemistry whereas computational chemistry is usually used when a mathematical method is sufficiently well developed that it can be automated for implementation on a computer in theoretical chemistry chemists physicists and mathematicians develop algorithms and computer programs to predict atomic and molecular properties and reaction paths for chemical reactions computational chemists in contrast may simply apply existing computer programs and methodologies to specific chemical questions there are two different aspects to computational chemistry computational studies can be carried out to find a starting point for a laboratory synthesis or to assist in understanding experimental data such as the position and source of spectroscopic peaks computational studies can be used to predict the possibility of so far entirely unknown molecules or to explore reaction mechanisms that are not readily studied by experimental means thus computational chemistry can assist the experimental chemist or it can challenge the experimental chemist to find entirely new chemical objects several major areas may be distinguished within computational chemistry the prediction of the molecular structure of molecules by the use of the simulation of forces or more accurate quantum chemical methods to find stationary points on the energy surface as the position of the nuclei is varied storing and searching for data on chemical entities see chemical databases identifying correlations between chemical structures and properties see qspr and qsar computational approaches to help in the efficient synthesis of compounds computational approaches to design molecules that interact in specific ways with other molecules e g drug design and catalysis edit accuracy the words exact and perfect do not appear here as very few aspects of chemistry can be computed exactly however almost every aspect of chemistry can be described in a qualitative or approximate quantitative computational scheme molecules consist of nuclei and electrons so the methods of quantum mechanics apply computational chemists often attempt to solve the non relativistic schr dinger equation with relativistic corrections added although some progress has been made in solving the fully relativistic dirac equation in principle it is possible to solve the schr dinger equation in either its time dependent or time independent form as appropriate for the problem in hand in practice this is not possible except for very small systems therefore a great number of approximate methods strive to achieve the best trade off between accuracy and computational cost accuracy can always be improved with greater computational cost significant errors can present themselves in ab initio models comprising many electrons due to the computational expense of full relativistic inclusive methods this complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic mass unit atoms such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with sufficient accuracy errors for energies can be less than a few kj mol for geometries bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0 5 degrees the treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen electrons is computationally tractable by approximate methods such as density functional theory dft there is some dispute within the field whether or not the latter methods are sufficient to describe complex chemical reactions such as those in biochemistry large molecules can be studied by semi empirical approximate methods even larger molecules are treated by classical mechanics methods that employ what are called molecular mechanics in qm mm methods small portions of large complexes are treated quantum mechanically qm and the remainder is treated approximately mm edit methods a single molecular formula can represent a number of molecular isomers each isomer is a local minimum on the energy surface called the potential energy surface created from the total energy i e the electronic energy plus the repulsion energy between the nuclei as a function of the coordinates of all the nuclei a stationary point is a geometry such that the derivative of the energy with respect to all displacements of the nuclei is zero a local energy minimum is a stationary point where all such displacements lead to an increase in energy the local minimum that is lowest is called the global minimum and corresponds to the most stable isomer if there is one particular coordinate change that leads to a decrease in the total energy in both directions the stationary point is a transition structure and the coordinate is the reaction coordinate this process of determining stationary points is called geometry optimization the determination of molecular structure by geometry optimization became routine only after efficient methods for calculating the first derivatives of the energy with respect to all atomic coordinates became available evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies if harmonic motion is estimated more importantly it allows for the characterization of stationary points the frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix which contains second derivatives if the eigenvalues are all positive then the frequencies are all real and the stationary point is a local minimum if one eigenvalue is negative i e an imaginary frequency then the stationary point is a transition structure if more than one eigenvalue is negative then the stationary point is a more complex one and is usually of little interest when one of these is found it is necessary to move the search away from it if the experimenter is looking solely for local minima and transition structures the total energy is determined by approximate solutions of the time dependent schr dinger equation usually with no relativistic terms included and by making use of the born oppenheimer approximation which allows for the separation of electronic and nuclear motions thereby simplifying the schr dinger equation this leads to the evaluation of the total energy as a sum of the electronic energy at fixed nuclei positions and the repulsion energy of the nuclei a notable exception are certain approaches called direct quantum chemistry which treat electrons and nuclei on a common footing density functional methods and semi empirical methods are variants on the major theme for very large systems the relative total energies can be compared using molecular mechanics the ways of determining the total energy to predict molecular structures are edit ab initio methods main article ab initio quantum chemistry methods the programs used in computational chemistry are based on many different quantum chemical methods that solve the molecular schr dinger equation associated with the molecular hamiltonian methods that do not include any empirical or semi empirical parameters in their equations 160 being derived directly from theoretical principles with no inclusion of experimental data 160 are called ab initio methods this does not imply that the solution is an exact one they are all approximate quantum mechanical calculations it means that a particular approximation is rigorously defined on first principles quantum theory and then solved within an error margin that is qualitatively known beforehand if numerical iterative methods have to be employed the aim is to iterate until full machine accuracy is obtained the best that is possible with a finite word length on the computer and within the mathematical and or physical approximations made diagram illustrating various ab initio electronic structure methods in terms of energy spacings are not to scale the simplest type of ab initio electronic structure calculation is the hartree fock hf scheme an extension of molecular orbital theory in which the correlated electron electron repulsion is not specifically taken into account only its average effect is included in the calculation as the basis set size is increased the energy and wave function tend towards a limit called the hartree fock limit many types of calculations known as post hartree fock methods begin with a hartree fock calculation and subsequently correct for electron electron repulsion referred to also as electronic correlation as these methods are pushed to the limit they approach the exact solution of the non relativistic schr dinger equation in order to obtain exact agreement with experiment it is necessary to include relativistic and spin orbit terms both of which are only really important for heavy atoms in all of these approaches in addition to the choice of method it is necessary to choose a basis set this is a set of functions usually centered on the different atoms in the molecule which are used to expand the molecular orbitals with the lcao ansatz ab initio methods need to define a level of theory the method and a basis set the hartree fock wave function is a single configuration or determinant in some cases particularly for bond breaking processes this is quite inadequate and several configurations need to be used here the coefficients of the configurations and the coefficients of the basis functions are optimized together the total molecular energy can be evaluated as a function of the molecular geometry in other words the potential energy surface such a surface can be used for reaction dynamics the stationary points of the surface lead to predictions of different isomers and the transition structures for conversion between isomers but these can be determined without a full knowledge of the complete surface a particularly important objective called computational thermochemistry is to calculate thermochemical quantities such as the enthalpy of formation to chemical accuracy chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is generally considered to be 1 160 kcal mol or 4 160 kj mol to reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post hartree fock methods and combine the results these methods are called quantum chemistry composite methods edit density functional methods main article density functional theory density functional theory dft methods are often considered to be ab initio methods for determining the molecular electronic structure even though many of the most common functionals use parameters derived from empirical data or from more complex calculations in dft the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one electron density rather than the wave function in this type of calculation there is an approximate hamiltonian and an approximate expression for the total electron density dft methods can be very accurate for little computational cost some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the hartree fock exchange term and are known as hybrid functional methods edit semi empirical and empirical methods main article semi empirical quantum chemistry methods semi empirical quantum chemistry methods are based on the hartree fock formalism but make many approximations and obtain some parameters from empirical data they are very important in computational chemistry for treating large molecules where the full hartree fock method without the approximations is too expensive the use of empirical parameters appears to allow some inclusion of correlation effects into the methods semi empirical methods follow what are often called empirical methods where the two electron part of the hamiltonian is not explicitly included for electron systems this was the h ckel method proposed by erich h ckel and for all valence electron systems the extended h ckel method proposed by roald hoffmann edit molecular mechanics main article molecular mechanics in many cases large molecular systems can be modeled successfully while avoiding quantum mechanical calculations entirely molecular mechanics simulations for example use a single classical expression for the energy of a compound for instance the harmonic oscillator all constants appearing in the equations must be obtained beforehand from experimental data or ab initio calculations the database of compounds used for parameterization i e the resulting set of parameters and functions is called the force field is crucial to the success of molecular mechanics calculations a force field parameterized against a specific class of molecules for instance proteins would be expected to only have any relevance when describing other molecules of the same class these methods can be applied to proteins and other large biological molecules and allow studies of the approach and interaction docking of potential drug molecules e g 1 and 2 edit methods for solids main article computational chemical methods in solid state physics computational chemical methods can be applied to solid state physics problems the electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a band structure which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the brillouin zone ab initio and semi empirical calculations yield orbital energies therefore they can be applied to band structure calculations since it is time consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule it is even more time consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the brillouin zone edit chemical dynamics once the electronic and nuclear variables are separated within the born oppenheimer representation in the time dependent approach the wave packet corresponding to the nuclear degrees of freedom is propagated via the time evolution operator physics associated to the time dependent schr dinger equation for the full molecular hamiltonian in the complementary energy dependent approach the time independent schr dinger equation is solved using the scattering theory formalism the potential representing the interatomic interaction is given by the potential energy surfaces in general the potential energy surfaces are coupled via the vibronic coupling terms the most popular methods for propagating the wave packet associated to the molecular geometry are the split operator technique the chebyshev real polynomial the multi configuration time dependent hartree method mctdh the semiclassical method edit molecular dynamics main article molecular dynamics molecular dynamics md use either quantum mechanics newton s laws of motion or a mixed model to examine the time dependent behavior of systems including vibrations or brownian motion and reactions md combined with density functional theory leads to hybrid models edit interpreting molecular wave functions the atoms in molecules model developed by richard bader was developed in order to effectively link the quantum mechanical picture of a molecule as an electronic wavefunction to chemically useful older models such as the theory of lewis pairs and the valence bond model bader has demonstrated that these empirically useful models are connected with the topology of the quantum charge density this method improves on the use of mulliken population analysis edit software packages there are many self sufficient software packages used by computational chemists some include many methods covering a wide range while others concentrating on a very specific range or even a single method details of most of them can be found in biomolecular modelling programs proteins nucleic acid molecular mechanics programs quantum
