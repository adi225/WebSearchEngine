talk page march 2012 in statistics statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions from data that is subject to random variation for example observational errors or sampling variation 1 more substantially the terms statistical inference statistical induction and inferential statistics are used to describe systems of procedures that can be used to draw conclusions from datasets arising from systems affected by random variation 2 such as observational errors random sampling or random experimentation 1 initial requirements of such a system of procedures for inference and induction are that the system should produce reasonable answers when applied to well defined situations and that it should be general enough to be applied across a range of situations the outcome of statistical inference may be an answer to the question what should be done next where this might be a decision about making further experiments or surveys or about drawing a conclusion before implementing some organizational or governmental policy contents 1 introduction 1 1 scope 1 2 comparison to descriptive statistics 2 models assumptions 2 1 degree of models assumptions 2 2 importance

population of interest via some form of random sampling more generally data about a random process is obtained from its observed behavior during a finite period of time given a parameter or hypothesis about which one wishes to make inference statistical inference most often uses a statistical model of the random process that is supposed to generate the data which is known when randomization has been used and a particular realization of the random process i e a set of data the conclusion of a statistical inference is a statistical proposition citation needed some common forms of statistical proposition are an estimate i e a particular value that best approximates some parameter of interest a confidence interval or set estimate i e an interval constructed using a dataset drawn from a population so that under repeated sampling of such datasets such intervals would contain the true parameter value with the probability at the stated confidence level a credible interval i e a set of values containing for example 95 of posterior belief rejection of a hypothesis 3 clustering or classification of data points into groups edit comparison to descriptive statistics statistical inference is generally distinguished from descriptive statistics in simple terms descriptive statistics can be thought of as being just a straightforward presentation of facts in which modeling decisions made by a data analyst have had minimal influence edit models assumptions main articles statistical model and statistical assumptions any statistical inference requires some assumptions a statistical model is a set of assumptions concerning the generation of the observed data and similar data descriptions of statistical models usually emphasize the role of population quantities of interest about which we wish to draw inference 4 descriptive statistics are typically used as a preliminary step before more formal inferences are drawn 5 edit degree of models assumptions statisticians distinguish between three levels of modeling assumptions fully parametric the probability distributions describing the data generation process are assumed to be fully described by a family of probability distributions involving only a finite number of unknown parameters 4 for example one may assume that the distribution of population values is truly normal with unknown mean and variance and that datasets are generated by simple random sampling the family of generalized linear models is a widely used and flexible class of parametric models non parametric the assumptions made about the process generating the data are much less than in parametric statistics and may be minimal 6 for example every continuous probability distribution has a median which may be estimated using the sample median or the hodges lehmann sen estimator which has good properties when the data arise from simple random sampling semi parametric this term typically implies assumptions in between fully and non parametric approaches for example one may assume that a population distribution has a finite mean furthermore one may assume that the mean response level in the population depends in a truly linear manner on some covariate a parametric assumption but not make any parametric assumption describing the variance around that mean i e about the presence or possible form of any heteroscedasticity more generally semi parametric models can often be separated into structural and random variation components one component is treated parametrically and the other non parametrically the well known cox model is a set of semi parametric assumptions edit importance of valid models assumptions whatever level of assumption is made correctly calibrated inference in general requires these assumptions to be correct i e that the data generating mechanisms really has been correctly specified incorrect assumptions of simple random sampling can invalidate statistical inference 7 more complex semi and fully parametric assumptions are also cause for concern for example incorrectly assuming the cox model can in some cases lead to faulty conclusions 8 incorrect assumptions of normality in the population also invalidates some forms of regression based inference 9 the use of any parametric model is viewed skeptically by most experts in sampling human populations most sampling statisticians when they deal with confidence intervals at all limit themselves to statements about estimators based on very large samples where the central limit theorem ensures that these estimators will have distributions that are nearly normal 10 in particular a normal distribution would be a totally unrealistic and catastrophically unwise assumption to make if we were dealing with any kind of economic population 10 here the central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean for very large samples is approximately normally distributed if the distribution is not heavy tailed edit approximate distributions main articles statistical distance asymptotic theory statistics and approximation theory given the difficulty in specifying exact distributions of sample statistics many methods have been developed for approximating these with finite samples approximation results measure how close a limiting distribution approaches the statistic s sample distribution for example with 10 000 independent samples the normal distribution approximates to two digits of accuracy the distribution of the sample mean for many population distributions by the berry esseen theorem 11 yet for many practical purposes the normal approximation provides a good approximation to the sample mean s distribution when there are 10 or more independent samples according to simulation studies and statisticians experience 11 following kolmogorov s work in the 1950s advanced statistics uses approximation theory and functional analysis to quantify the error of approximation in this approach the metric geometry of probability distributions is studied this approach quantifies approximation error with for example the kullback leibler distance bregman divergence and the hellinger distance 12 13 14 with indefinitely large samples limiting results like the central limit theorem describe the sample statistic s limiting distribution if one exists limiting results are not statements about finite samples and indeed are irrelevant to finite samples 15 16 17 however the asymptotic theory of limiting distributions is often invoked for work with finite samples for example limiting results are often invoked to justify the generalized method of moments and the use of generalized estimating equations which are popular in econometrics and biostatistics the magnitude of the difference between the limiting distribution and the true distribution formally the error of the approximation can be assessed using simulation 18 the heuristic application of limiting results to finite samples is common practice in many applications especially with low dimensional models with log concave likelihoods such as with one parameter exponential families edit randomization based models main article randomization see also random sample 160 and random assignment for a given dataset that was produced by a randomization design the randomization distribution of a statistic under the null hypothesis is defined by evaluating the test statistic for all of the plans that could have been generated by the randomization design in frequentist inference randomization allows inferences to be based on the randomization distribution rather than a subjective model and this is important especially in survey sampling and design of experiments 19 20 statistical inference from randomized studies is also more straightforward than many other situations 21 22 23 in bayesian inference randomization is also of importance in survey sampling use of sampling without replacement ensures the exchangeability of the sample with the population in randomized experiments randomization warrants a missing at random assumption for covariate information 24 objective randomization allows properly inductive procedures 25 26 27 28 many statisticians prefer randomization based analysis of data that was generated by well defined randomization procedures 29 however it is true that in fields of science with developed theoretical knowledge and experimental control randomized experiments may increase the costs of experimentation without improving the quality of inferences 30 31 similarly results from randomized experiments are recommended by leading statistical authorities as allowing inferences with greater reliability than do observational studies of the same phenomena 32 however a good observational study may be better than a bad randomized experiment the statistical analysis of a randomized experiment may be based on the randomization scheme stated in the experimental protocol and does not need a subjective model 33 34 however at any time some hypotheses cannot be tested using objective statistical models which accurately describe randomized experiments or random samples in some cases such randomized studies are uneconomical or unethical edit model based analysis of randomized experiments it is standard practice to refer to a statistical model often a linear model when analyzing data from randomized experiments however the randomization scheme guides the choice of a statistical model it is not possible to choose an appropriate model without knowing the randomization scheme 20 seriously misleading results can be obtained analyzing data from randomized experiments while ignoring the experimental protocol common mistakes include forgetting the blocking used in an experiment and confusing repeated measurements on the same experimental unit with independent replicates of the treatment applied to different experimental units 35 edit modes of inference different schools of statistical inference have become established these schools or paradigms are not mutually exclusive and methods which work well under one paradigm often have attractive interpretations under other paradigms the two main paradigms in use are frequentist and bayesian inference which are both summarized below edit frequentist inference see also frequentist inference this paradigm calibrates the production of propositions clarification needed complicated jargon by considering notional repeated sampling of datasets similar to the one at hand by considering its characteristics under repeated sample the frequentist properties of any statistical inference procedure can be described 160 although in practice this quantification may be challenging edit examples of frequentist inference p value confidence interval edit frequentist inference objectivity and decision theory one interpretation of frequentist inference or classical inference is that it is applicable only in terms of frequency probability that is in terms of repeated sampling from a population however the approach of neyman 36 develops these procedures in terms of pre experiment probabilities that is before undertaking an experiment one decides on a rule for coming to a conclusion such that the probability of being correct is controlled in a suitable way such a probability need not have a frequentist or repeated sampling interpretation in contrast bayesian inference works in terms of conditional probabilities i e probabilities conditional on the observed data compared to the marginal but conditioned on unknown parameters probabilities used in the frequentist approach the frequentist procedures of significance testing and confidence intervals can be constructed without regard to utility functions however some elements of frequentist statistics such as statistical decision theory do incorporate utility functions citation needed in particular frequentist developments of optimal inference such as minimum variance unbiased estimators or uniformly most powerful testing make use of loss functions which play the role of negative utility functions loss functions need not be explicitly stated for statistical theorists to prove that a statistical procedure has an optimality property 37 however loss functions are often useful for stating optimality properties for example median unbiased estimators are optimal under absolute value loss functions in that they minimize expected loss and least squares estimators are optimal under squared error loss functions in that they minimize expected loss while statisticians using frequentist inference must choose for themselves the parameters of interest and the estimators test statistic to be used the absence of obviously explicit utilities and prior distributions has helped frequentist procedures to become widely viewed as objective citation needed edit bayesian inference see also bayesian inference the bayesian calculus describes degrees of belief using the language of probability beliefs are positive integrate to one and obey probability axioms bayesian inference uses the available posterior beliefs as the basis for making statistical propositions there are several different justifications for using the bayesian approach edit examples of bayesian inference credible intervals for interval estimation bayes factors for model comparison edit bayesian inference subjectivity and decision theory many informal bayesian inferences are based on intuitively reasonable summaries of the posterior for example the posterior mean median and mode highest posterior density intervals and bayes factors can all be motivated in this way while a user s utility function need not be stated for this sort of inference these summaries do all depend to some extent on stated prior beliefs and are generally viewed as subjective conclusions methods of prior construction which do not require external input have been proposed but not yet fully developed formally bayesian inference is calibrated with reference to an explicitly stated utility or loss function the bayes rule is the one which maximizes expected utility averaged over the posterior uncertainty formal bayesian inference therefore automatically provides optimal decisions in a decision theoretic sense given assumptions data and utility bayesian inference can be made for essentially any problem although not every statistical inference need have a bayesian interpretation analyses which are not formally bayesian can be logically incoherent a feature of bayesian procedures which use proper priors i e those integrable to one is that they are guaranteed to be coherent some advocates of bayesian inference assert that inference must take place in this decision theoretic framework and that bayesian inference should not conclude with the evaluation and summarization of posterior beliefs edit other modes of inference besides frequentist and bayesian edit information and computational complexity main article minimum description length see also information theory kolmogorov complexity 160 and data mining other forms of statistical inference have been developed from ideas in information theory 38 and the theory of kolmogorov complexity 39 for example the minimum description length mdl principle selects statistical models that maximally compress the data inference proceeds without assuming counterfactual or non falsifiable data generating mechanisms or probability models for the data as might be done in frequentist or bayesian approaches however if a data generating mechanism does exist in reality then according to shannon s source coding theorem it provides the mdl description of the data on average and asymptotically 40 in minimizing description length or descriptive complexity mdl estimation is similar to maximum likelihood estimation and maximum a posteriori estimation using maximum entropy bayesian priors however mdl avoids assuming that the underlying probability model is known the mdl principle can also be applied without assumptions that e g the data arose from independent sampling 40 41 the mdl principle has been applied in communication coding theory in information theory in linear regression and in time series analysis particularly for choosing the degrees of the polynomials in autoregressive moving average arma models 41 information theoretic statistical inference has been popular in data mining which has become a common approach for very large observational and heterogeneous datasets made possible by the computer revolution and internet 39 the evaluation of statistical inferential procedures often uses techniques or criteria from computational complexity theory or numerical analysis 42 43 edit fiducial inference main article fiducial inference fiducial inference was an approach to statistical inference based on fiducial probability also known as a fiducial distribution in subsequent work this approach has been called ill defined extremely limited in applicability and even fallacious 44 45 however this argument is the same as that which shows 46 that a so called confidence distribution is not a valid probability distribution and since this has not invalidated the application of confidence intervals it does not necessarily invalidate conclusions drawn from fiducial arguments edit structural inference developing ideas of fisher and of pitman from 1938 to 1939 47 george a barnard developed structural inference or pivotal inference 48 an approach using invariant probabilities on group families barnard reformulated the arguments behind fiducial inference on a restricted class of models on which fiducial procedures would be well defined and useful edit
