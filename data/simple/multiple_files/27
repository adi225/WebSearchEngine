anomaly detection also referred to as outlier detection 1 refers to detecting patterns in a given data set that do not conform to an established normal behavior 2 the patterns thus detected are called anomalies and often translate to critical and actionable information in several application domains anomalies are also referred to as outliers change deviation surprise aberrant peculiarity intrusion etc in particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting objects are often not rare objects but unexpected bursts in activity this pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object and many outlier detection methods in particular unsupervised methods will fail on such data unless it has been aggregated appropriately instead a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro clusters formed by these patterns 3 three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherent unbalanced nature of outlier detection semi supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then testing the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the learnt model citation needed contents 1 applications 2 popular techniques 3 application to data security 4 time series outlier detection 5 see also 6 references edit applications anomaly detection is applicable in a variety of domains such as intrusion detection fraud detection fault detection system health monitoring event detection in sensor networks and detecting eco system disturbances it is often used in preprocessing to remove anomalous data from the dataset in supervised learning removing the anomalous data from the dataset often results in a statistically significant increase in accuracy 4 5 edit popular techniques several anomaly detection techniques have been proposed in literature some of the popular techniques are distance based techniques k nearest neighbor local outlier factor 6 one class support vector machines replicator neural networks cluster analysis based outlier detection pointing at records that deviate from learned association rules edit application to data security anomaly detection was proposed for intrusion detection systems ids by dorothy denning in 1986 7 anomaly detection for ids is normally accomplished with thresholds and statistics but can also be done with soft computing and inductive learning 8 types of statistics proposed by 1999 included profiles of users workstations networks remote hosts groups of users and programs based on frequencies means variances covariances and standard deviations 9 the counterpart of anomaly detection in intrusion detection is misuse detection edit time series outlier detection parametric tests to find outliers in time series are implemented in almost all statistical packages demetra for example uses the most popular ones one way to detect anomalies in time series is a simple non parametric method called washer 10 it uses a non parametric test to find one or more outliers in a group of even very short time series the group must have a similar behaviour as explained more fully below an example is that of municipalities cited in the work of dahlberg and johanssen 2000 11 swedish municipalities expenditures between 1979 and 1987 represent 256 time series if you consider three years such as for example 1981 1982 and 1983 you have 256 simple polygonal chains made of two lines segments every couple of segments can approximate a straight line or a convex downward or convex upward simple polygonal chain the idea is to find outliers among the couples of segments that performs in a too much different way from the other couples in the washer procedure every couple of segments is represented by an index and a non parametric test sprent test 12 is applied to the unknown distribution of those indices 13 for implementing washer methodology you can download an open source r programming language function with a simple numeric example 14 edit see also outliers in
