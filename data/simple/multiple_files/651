february 2009 xml retrieval or xml information retrieval 1 is the content based retrieval of documents structured with xml extensible markup language as such it is used for computing relevance of xml documents 2 contents 1 queries 2 exploiting xml structure 3 ranking 4 existing xml search engines 4 1 traditional xml query languages 4 2 databases 4 3 information retrieval 5 see also 6 references edit queries most xml retrieval approaches do so based on techniques from the information retrieval ir area e g by computing the similarity between a query consisting of keywords query terms and the document however in xml retrieval the query can also contain structural hints so called content and structure cas queries enable users to specify what structure the requested content can or must have edit exploiting xml structure taking advantage of the self describing structure of xml documents can improve the search for xml documents significantly this includes the use of cas queries the weighting of different xml elements differently and the focused retrieval of subdocuments edit ranking ranking in xml retrieval can incorporate both content relevance and structural similarity which is the resemblance between the structure given in the query and the structure of the document also the retrieval units resulting from an xml query may not always be entire documents but can be any deeply nested xml elements i e dynamic documents the aim is to find the smallest retrieval unit that is highly relevant relevance can be defined according to the notion of specificity which is the extent to which a retrieval unit focuses on the topic of request 3 edit existing xml search engines an overview of two potential approaches is available 4 5 the initiative for the evaluation of xml retrieval inex was founded in 2002 and provides a platform for evaluating such algorithms 3 three different areas influence xml retrieval 6 edit traditional xml query languages query languages such as the w3c standard xquery 7 supply complex queries but only look for exact matches therefore they need to be extended to allow for vague search with relevance computing most xml centered approaches imply a quite exact knowledge of the documents schemas 8 edit databases classic database systems have adopted the possibility to store semi structured data 6 and resulted in the development of xml databases often they are very formal concentrate more on searching than on ranking and are used by experienced users able to formulate complex queries edit information retrieval classic information retrieval models such as the vector space model provide relevance ranking but do not include document structure only flat queries are supported also they apply a static document concept so retrieval units usually are entire documents 8 they can be extended to consider structural information and dynamic document retrieval examples for approaches extending the vector space models are available they use document subtrees index terms plus structure as dimensions of the vector space 9 edit see also document retrieval information retrieval applications edit references luk r w p h v leong t s dillon
