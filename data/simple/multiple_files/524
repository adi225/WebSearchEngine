w3c s semantic web logo the semantic web is a collaborative movement led by the international standards body the world wide web consortium w3c 1 the standard promotes common data formats on the world wide web by encouraging the inclusion of semantic content in web pages the semantic web aims at converting the current web dominated by unstructured and semi structured documents into a web of data the semantic web stack builds on the w3c s resource description framework rdf 2 according to the w3c the semantic web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application enterprise and community boundaries 2 the term was coined by tim berners lee 3 the inventor of the world wide web and director of the world wide web consortium w3c which oversees the development of proposed semantic web standards he defines the semantic web as a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines while its critics have questioned its feasibility proponents argue that applications in industry biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept scholars have explored the social potential of the semantic web in the business and health sectors and for social networking 4 the original 2001 scientific american article by berners lee described an expected evolution of the existing web to a semantic web 5 but this has yet to happen in 2006 berners lee and colleagues stated that this simple idea remains largely unrealized 6 contents 1 history 2 purpose 2 1 limitations of html 2 2 semantic web solutions

early sixties by the cognitive scientist allan m collins linguist m ross quillian and psychologist elizabeth f loftus in various publications 7 8 9 10 11 as a form to represent semantically structured knowledge it extends the network of hyperlinked human readable web pages by inserting machine readable metadata about pages and how they are related to each other enabling automated agents to access the web more intelligently and perform tasks on behalf of users the term was coined by tim berners lee 3 the inventor of the world wide web and director of the world wide web consortium w3c which oversees the development of proposed semantic web standards he defines the semantic web as a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines many of the technologies proposed by the w3c already existed before they were positioned under the w3c umbrella these are used in various contexts particularly those dealing with information that encompasses a limited and defined domain and where sharing data is a common necessity such as scientific research or data exchange among businesses in addition other technologies with similar goals have emerged such as microformats edit purpose the main purpose of the semantic web is driving the evolution of the current web by enabling users to find share and combine information more easily humans are capable of using the web to carry out tasks such as finding the estonian translation for twelve months reserving a library book and searching for the lowest price for a dvd however machines cannot accomplish all of these tasks without human direction because web pages are designed to be read by people not machines the semantic web is a vision of information that can be readily interpreted by machines so machines can perform more of the tedious work involved in finding combining and acting upon information on the web the semantic web as originally envisioned is a system that enables machines to understand and respond to complex human requests based on their meaning such an understanding requires that the relevant information sources be semantically structured tim berners lee originally expressed the vision of the semantic web as follows 12 i have a dream for the web in which computers become capable of analyzing all the data on the web 160 the content links and transactions between people and computers a semantic web which should make this possible has yet to emerge but when it does the day to day mechanisms of trade bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines the intelligent agents people have touted for ages will finally materialize the semantic web is regarded as an integrator across different content information applications and systems it has applications in publishing blogging and many other areas often the terms semantics metadata ontologies and semantic web are used inconsistently in particular these terms are used as everyday terminology by researchers and practitioners spanning a vast landscape of different fields technologies concepts and application areas furthermore there is confusion with regard to the current status of the enabling technologies envisioned to realize the semantic web in a paper presented by gerber barnard and van der merwe 13 the semantic web landscape is charted and a brief summary of related terms and enabling technologies is presented the architectural model proposed by tim berners lee is used as basis to present a status model that reflects current and emerging technologies 14 edit limitations of html many files on a typical computer can be loosely divided into human readable documents and machine readable data documents like mail messages reports and brochures are read by humans data like calendars addressbooks playlists and spreadsheets are presented using an application program which lets them be viewed searched and combined in different ways currently the world wide web is based mainly on documents written in hypertext markup language html a markup convention that is used for coding a body of text interspersed with multimedia objects such as images and interactive forms metadata tags provide a method by which computers can categorise the content of web pages for example lt meta name keywords content computing computer studies computer gt lt meta name description content cheap widgets for sale gt lt meta name author content john doe gt with html and a tool to render it perhaps web browser software perhaps another user agent one can create and present a page that lists items for sale the html of this catalog page can make simple document level assertions such as this document s title is widget superstore but there is no capability within the html itself to assert unambiguously that for example item number x586172 is an acme gizmo with a retail price of 199 or that it is a consumer product rather html can only say that the span of text x586172 is something that should be positioned near acme gizmo and 199 etc there is no way to say this is a catalog or even to establish that acme gizmo is a kind of title or that 199 is a price there is also no way to express that these pieces of information are bound together in describing a discrete item distinct from other items perhaps listed on the page semantic html refers to the traditional html practice of markup following intention rather than specifying layout details directly for example the use of lt em gt denoting emphasis rather than lt i gt which specifies italics layout details are left up to the browser in combination with cascading style sheets but this practice falls short of specifying the semantics of objects such as items for sale or prices microformats represent unofficial attempts to extend html syntax to create machine readable semantic markup about objects such as retail stores and items for sale edit semantic web solutions the semantic web takes the solution further it involves publishing in languages specifically designed for data resource description framework rdf web ontology language owl and extensible markup language xml html describes documents and the links between them rdf owl and xml by contrast can describe arbitrary things such as people meetings or airplane parts these technologies are combined in order to provide descriptions that supplement or replace the content of web documents thus content may manifest itself as descriptive data stored in web accessible databases 15 or as markup within documents particularly in extensible html xhtml interspersed with xml or more often purely in xml with layout or rendering cues stored separately the machine readable descriptions enable content managers to add meaning to the content i e to describe the structure of the knowledge we have about that content in this way a machine can process knowledge itself instead of text using processes similar to human deductive reasoning and inference thereby obtaining more meaningful results and helping computers to perform automated information gathering and research an example of a tag that would be used in a non semantic web page lt item gt blog lt item gt encoding similar information in a semantic web page might look like this lt item rdf about http techmites com semantic web a meaningful search engine gt blog lt item gt tim berners lee calls the resulting network of linked data the giant global graph in contrast to the html based world wide web berners lee posits that if the past was document sharing the future is data sharing his answer to the question of how provides three points of instruction one a url should point to the data two anyone accessing the url should get data back three relationships in the data should point to additional urls with data edit web 3 0 main article web 3 0 tim berners lee has described the semantic web as a component of web 3 0 16 people keep asking what web 3 0 is i think maybe when you ve got an overlay of scalable vector graphics 160 everything rippling and folding and looking misty 160 on web 2 0 and access to a semantic web integrated across a huge space of data you ll have access to an unbelievable data resource tim berners lee 2006 semantic web is sometimes used as a synonym for web 3 0 17 though each term s definition varies edit challenges some of the challenges for the semantic web include vastness vagueness uncertainty inconsistency and deceit automated reasoning systems will have to deal with all of these issues in order to deliver on the promise of the semantic web vastness the world wide web contains many billions of pages the snomed ct medical terminology ontology alone contains 370 000 class names and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms any automated reasoning system will have to deal with truly huge inputs vagueness these are imprecise concepts like young or tall this arises from the vagueness of user queries of concepts represented by content providers of matching query terms to provider terms and of trying to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts fuzzy logic is the most common technique for dealing with vagueness uncertainty these are precise concepts with uncertain values for example a patient might present a set of symptoms which correspond to a number of different distinct diagnoses each with a different probability probabilistic reasoning techniques are generally employed to address uncertainty inconsistency these are logical contradictions which will inevitably arise during the development of large ontologies and when ontologies from separate sources are combined deductive reasoning fails catastrophically when faced with inconsistency because anything follows from a contradiction defeasible reasoning and paraconsistent reasoning are two techniques which can be employed to deal with inconsistency deceit this is when the producer of the information is intentionally misleading the consumer of the information cryptography techniques are currently utilized to alleviate this threat this list of challenges is illustrative rather than exhaustive and it focuses on the challenges to the unifying logic and proof layers of the semantic web the world wide web consortium w3c incubator group for uncertainty reasoning for the world wide web urw3 xg final report lumps these problems together under the single heading of uncertainty many of the techniques mentioned here will require extensions to the web ontology language owl for example to annotate conditional probabilities this is an area of active research 18 edit standards standardization for semantic web in the context of web 3 0 is under the care of w3c 19 edit components the term semantic web is often used more specifically to refer to the formats and technologies that enable it 2 the collection structuring and recovery of linked data are enabled by technologies that provide a formal description of concepts terms and relationships within a given knowledge domain these technologies are specified as w3c standards and include resource description framework rdf a general method for describing information rdf schema rdfs simple knowledge organization system skos sparql an rdf query language notation3 n3 designed with human readability in mind n triples a format for storing and transmitting data turtle terse rdf triple language web ontology language owl a family of knowledge representation languages the semantic web stack the semantic web stack illustrates the architecture of the semantic web the functions and relationships of the components can be summarized as follows 20 xml provides an elemental syntax for content structure within documents yet associates no semantics with the meaning of the content contained within xml is not at present a necessary component of semantic web technologies in most cases as alternative syntaxes exists such as turtle turtle is a de facto standard but has not been through a formal standardization process xml schema is a language for providing and restricting the structure and content of elements contained within xml documents rdf is a simple language for expressing data models which refer to objects resources and their relationships an rdf based model can be represented in a variety of syntaxes e g rdf xml n3 turtle and rdfa 21 rdf is a fundamental standard of the semantic web 22 23 24 rdf schema extends rdf and is a vocabulary for describing properties and classes of rdf based resources with semantics for generalized hierarchies of such properties and classes owl adds more vocabulary for describing properties and classes among others relations between classes e g disjointness cardinality e g exactly one equality richer typing of properties characteristics of properties e g symmetry and enumerated classes sparql is a protocol and query language for semantic web data sources edit current state of standardization well established standards unicode uniform resource identifier xml rdf rdfs sparql owl ongoing standardization rule interchange format rif as the rule layer of the semantic web stack not yet fully realized unifying logic and proof layers the intent is to enhance the usability and usefulness of the web and its interconnected resources through servers which expose existing data systems using the rdf and sparql standards many converters to rdf exist from different applications relational databases are an important source the semantic web server attaches to the existing system without affecting its operation documents marked up with semantic information an extension of the html lt meta gt tags used in today s web pages to supply information for web search engines using web crawlers this could be machine understandable information about the human understandable content of the document such as the creator title description etc or it could be purely metadata representing a set of facts such as resources and services elsewhere on the site note that anything that can be identified with a uniform resource identifier uri can be described so the semantic web can reason about animals people places ideas etc semantic markup is often generated automatically rather than manually common metadata vocabularies ontologies and maps between vocabularies that allow document creators to know how to mark up their documents so that agents can use the information in the supplied metadata so that author in the sense of the author of the page won t be confused with author in the sense of a book that is the subject of a book review automated agents to perform tasks for users of the semantic web using this data web based services often with agents of their own to supply information specifically to agents for example a trust service that an agent could ask if some online store has a history of poor service or spamming edit skeptical reactions edit practical feasibility critics e g which semantic web question the basic feasibility of a complete or even partial fulfillment of the semantic web cory doctorow s critique metacrap is from the perspective of human behavior and personal preferences for example people may include spurious metadata into web pages in an attempt to mislead semantic web engines that naively assume the metadata s veracity this phenomenon was well known with metatags that fooled the altavista ranking algorithm into elevating the ranking of certain web pages the google indexing engine specifically looks for such attempts at manipulation peter g rdenfors and timo honkela point out that logic based semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of the relevant phenomena related to semantics 25 26 where semantic web technologies have found a greater degree of practical adoption it has tended to be among core specialized communities and organizations for intra company projects 27 the practical constraints toward adoption have appeared less challenging where domain and scope is more limited than that of the general public and the world wide web 27 edit censorship and privacy enthusiasm about the semantic web could be tempered by concerns regarding censorship and privacy for instance text analyzing techniques can now be easily bypassed by using other words metaphors for instance or by using images in place of words an advanced implementation of the semantic web would make it much easier for governments to control the viewing and creation of online information as this information would be much easier for an automated content blocking machine to understand in addition the issue has also been raised that with the use of foaf files and geo location meta data there would be very little anonymity associated with the authorship of articles on things such as a personal blog some of these concerns were addressed in the policy aware web project 28 and is an active research and development topic edit doubling output formats another criticism of the semantic web is that it would be much more time consuming to create and publish content because there would need to be two formats for one piece of data one for human viewing and one for machines however many web applications in development are addressing this issue by creating a machine readable format upon the publishing of data or the request of a machine for such data the development of microformats has been one reaction to this kind of criticism another argument in defense of the feasibility of semantic web is the likely falling price of human intelligence tasks in digital labor markets such as the amazon mechanical turk specifications such as erdf and rdfa allow arbitrary rdf data to be embedded in html pages the grddl gleaning resource descriptions from dialects of language mechanism allows existing material including microformats to be automatically interpreted as rdf so publishers only need to use a single format such as html edit projects this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed november 2011 this section lists some of the many projects and tools that exist to create semantic web solutions 29 edit dbpedia main article dbpedia dbpedia is an effort to publish structured data extracted from wikipedia the data is published in rdf and made available on the web for use under the gnu free documentation license thus allowing semantic web agents to provide inferencing and advanced querying over the wikipedia derived dataset and facilitating interlinking re use and extension in other data sources 30 edit foaf a popular vocabulary on the semantic web is friend of a friend or foaf which uses rdf to describe the relationships people have to other people and the things around them foaf permits intelligent agents to make sense of the thousands of connections people have with each other their jobs and the items important to their lives 31 connections that may or may not be enumerated in searches using traditional web search engines because the connections are so vast in number human interpretation of the information may not be the best way of analyzing them foaf is an example of how the semantic web attempts to make use of the relationships within a social context edit sioc the semantically interlinked online communities project sioc pronounced shock provides a vocabulary of terms and relationships that model web data spaces examples of such data spaces include among others discussion forums blogs blogrolls feed subscriptions mailing lists shared bookmarks and image galleries edit gopubmed gopubmed is a knowledge based search engine for biomedical texts the gene ontology go and medical subject headings mesh serve as table of contents in order to structure the millions of articles of the medline database 32 the search engine allows its users to find relevant search results significantly faster than pubmed citation needed edit nextbio a database consolidating high throughput life sciences experimental data tagged and connected via biomedical ontologies nextbio is accessible via a search engine interface researchers can contribute their findings for incorporation to the database the database currently supports gene expression or protein expression data and sequence centric data and is steadily expanding to support other biological data types edit see also book semantic web agris international information system for the agricultural sciences and technology business semantics management computational semantics
