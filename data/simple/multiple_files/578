text mining sometimes alternately referred to as text data mining roughly equivalent to text analytics refers to the process of deriving high quality information from text high quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as statistical pattern learning text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text usually parsing along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others and subsequent insertion into a database deriving patterns within the structured data and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output high quality in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance novelty and interestingness typical text mining tasks include text categorization text clustering concept entity extraction production of granular taxonomies sentiment analysis document summarization and entity relation modeling i e learning relations between named entities text analysis involves information retrieval lexical analysis to study word frequency distributions pattern recognition tagging annotation information extraction data mining techniques including link and association analysis visualization and predictive analytics the overarching goal is essentially to turn text into data for analysis via application of natural language processing nlp and analytical methods a typical application is to scan a set of documents written in a natural language and either model the document set for predictive classification purposes or populate a database or search

structure the information content of textual sources for business intelligence exploratory data analysis research or investigation 1 the term is roughly synonymous with text mining indeed ronen feldman modified a 2000 description of text mining 2 in 2004 to describe text analytics 3 the latter term is now used more frequently in business settings while text mining is used in some of the earliest application areas dating to the 1980s 4 notably life sciences research and government intelligence the term text analytics also describes that application of text analytics to respond to business problems whether independently or in conjunction with query and analysis of fielded numerical data it is a truism that 80 percent of business relevant information originates in unstructured form primarily text 5 these techniques and processes discover and present knowledge facts business rules and relationships that is otherwise locked in textual form impenetrable to automated processing edit history labor intensive manual text mining approaches first surfaced in the mid 1980s 6 but technological advances have enabled the field to advance during the past decade text mining is an interdisciplinary field that draws on information retrieval data mining machine learning statistics and computational linguistics as most information common estimates say over 80 5 is currently stored as text text mining is believed to have a high commercial potential value increasing interest is being paid to multilingual data mining the ability to gain information across languages and cluster similar items from different linguistic sources according to their meaning the challenge of exploiting the large proportion of enterprise information that originates in unstructured form has been recognized for decades 7 it is recognized in the earliest definition of business intelligence bi in an october 1958 ibm journal article by h p luhn a business intelligence system which describes a system that will utilize data processing machines for auto abstracting and auto encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the action points in an organization both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted characterized by a word pattern and sent automatically to appropriate action points yet as management information systems developed starting in the 1960s and as bi emerged in the 80s and 90s as a software category and field of practice the emphasis was on numerical data stored in relational databases this is not surprising text in unstructured documents is hard to process the emergence of text analytics in its current form stems from a refocusing of research in the late 1990s from algorithm development to application as described by prof marti a hearst in the paper untangling text data mining 8 for almost a decade the computational linguistics community has viewed large text collections as a resource to be tapped in order to produce better text analysis algorithms in this paper i have attempted to suggest a new emphasis the use of large online text collections to discover new facts and trends about the world itself i suggest that to make progress we do not need fully artificial intelligent text analysis rather a mixture of computationally driven and user guided analysis may open the door to exciting new results hearst s 1999 statement of need fairly well describes the state of text analytics technology and practice a decade later edit text analysis processes subtasks components of a larger text analytics effort typically include information retrieval or identification of a corpus is a preparatory step collecting or identifying a set textual materials on the web or held in a file system database or content management system for analysis although some text analytics systems apply exclusively advanced statistical methods many others apply more extensive natural language processing such as part of speech tagging syntactic parsing and other types of linguistic analysis citation needed named entity recognition is the use of gazetteers or statistical techniques to identify named text features people organizations place names stock ticker symbols certain abbreviations and so on disambiguation the use of contextual clues may be required to decide where for instance ford refers to a former u s president a vehicle manufacturer a movie star glenn or harrison who a river crossing or some other entity recognition of pattern identified entities features such as telephone numbers e mail addresses quantities with units can be discerned via regular expression or other pattern matches coreference identification of noun phrases and other terms that refer to the same object relationship fact and event extraction identification of associations among entities and other information in text sentiment analysis involves discerning subjective as opposed to factual material and extracting various forms of attitudinal information sentiment opinion mood and emotion text analytics techniques are helpful in analyzing sentiment at the entity concept or topic level and in distinguishing opinion holder and opinion object 9 quantitative text analysis is a set of techniques stemming from the social sciences where either a human judge or a computer extracts semantic or grammatical relationships between words in order to find out the meaning or stylistic patterns of usually a casual personal text for the purpose of psychological profiling etc 10 edit applications the technology is now broadly applied for a wide variety of government research and business needs applications can be sorted into a number of categories by analysis type or by business function using this approach to classifying solutions application categories include enterprise business intelligence data mining competitive intelligence e discovery records management national security intelligence scientific discovery especially life sciences sentiment analysis tools listening platforms natural language semantic toolkit or service publishing automated ad placement search information access social media monitoring edit security applications many text mining software packages are marketed for security applications especially monitoring and analysis of online plain text sources such as internet news blogs etc for national security purposes 11 it is also involved in the study of text encryption decryption edit biomedical applications main article biomedical text mining a range of text mining applications in the biomedical literature has been described 12 one online text mining application in the biomedical literature is gopubmed 13 gopubmed was the first semantic search engine on the web citation needed another example is pubgene that combines biomedical text mining with network visualization as an internet service 14 tpx 15 is a concept assisted search and navigation tool for biomedical literature analyses it runs on pubmed pmc and can be configured on request to run on local literature repositories too edit software applications text mining methods and software is also being researched and developed by major firms including ibm and microsoft to further automate the mining and analysis processes and by different firms working in the area of search and indexing in general as a way to improve their results within public sector much effort has been concentrated on creating software for tracking and monitoring terrorist activities 16 edit online media applications text mining is being used by large media companies such as the tribune company to clarify information and to provide readers with greater search experiences which in turn increases site stickiness and revenue additionally on the back end editors are benefiting by being able to share associate and package news across properties significantly increasing opportunities to monetize content edit marketing applications text mining is starting to be used in marketing as well more specifically in analytical customer relationship management coussement and van den poel 2008 17 apply it to improve predictive analytics models for customer churn customer attrition 18 edit sentiment analysis sentiment analysis may involve analysis of movie reviews for estimating how favorable a review is for a movie 19 such an analysis may need a labeled data set or labeling of the affectivity of words resources for affectivity of words and concepts have been made for wordnet 20 and conceptnet 21 respectively text has been used to detect emotions in the related area of affective computing 22 text based approaches to affective computing have been used on multiple corpora such as students evaluations children stories and news stories edit academic applications the issue of text mining is of importance to publishers who hold large databases of information needing indexing for retrieval this is especially true in scientific disciplines in which highly specific information is often contained within written text therefore initiatives have been taken such as nature s proposal for an open text mining interface otmi and the national institutes of health s common journal publishing document type definition dtd that would provide semantic cues to machines to answer specific queries contained within text without removing publisher barriers to public access academic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative the national centre for text mining nactem is the first publicly funded text mining centre in the world nactem is operated by the university of manchester 23 in close collaboration with the tsujii lab 24 university of tokyo 25 nactem provides customised tools research facilities and offers advice to the academic community they are funded by the joint information systems committee jisc and two of the uk research councils epsrc amp bbsrc with an initial focus on text mining in the biological and biomedical sciences research has since expanded into the areas of social sciences in the united states the school of information at university of california berkeley is developing a program called biotext to assist biology researchers in text mining and analysis further private initiatives also offer tools for

implications until recently websites most often used text based searches which only found documents containing specific user defined words or phrases now through use of a semantic web text mining can find content based on meaning and context rather than just by a specific word additionally text mining software can be used to build large dossiers of information about specific people and events for example large datasets based on data extracted from news reports can be built to facilitate social networks analysis or counter intelligence in effect the text mining software may act in a capacity similar to an intelligence analyst or research librarian albeit with a more limited scope of analysis text mining is also used in some email spam filters as a way of determining the characteristics of
