1990s present search enginees such as altavista and google edit research methods of information science archival research facts or factual evidences from a variety of records are compiled computational complexity and structure algorithmic and graphic methods are used to explore the complexity of information systems retrieval and storage content analysis studies how people communicate by analyzing the contents of books and mass media as well as the messages people talk or write about case study specific set of circumstances or a group the case is analyzed according to a specific goal of study generally case studies are used to characterize a trend or development they have weak generalizability discourse analysis analyzing written oral and sign language use historical method involves a continuous and systematic search for the information and knowledge about past events related to the life of a person a group society or the world interviews researchers obtain data by

examination of a specific group over a long period of time observation using data from the senses one records information about a social phenomenon or behavior qualitative research relies heavily on observation although it is in a highly disciplined form participant observation involves researchers going into the field usually a community living with the people for some time and participating in
