this article relies on references to primary sources please add references to secondary or tertiary sources january 2013 named entity recognition ner also known as entity identification and entity extraction is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify atomic elements in text into predefined categories such as the names of persons organizations locations expressions of times quantities monetary values percentages etc most research on ner systems has been structured as taking an unannotated block of text such as this one jim bought 300 shares of acme corp in 2006 and producing an annotated block of text such as this one lt enamex type person gt jim lt enamex gt bought lt numex type quantity gt 300 lt numex gt shares of lt enamex type organization gt acme corp lt enamex gt in lt timex type date gt 2006 lt timex gt in this example the annotations have been done using so called enamex tags that were developed for the message understanding conference in the 1990s state of the art ner systems for english produce near human performance for example the best system entering muc 7 scored 93 39 of f measure while human annotators scored 97 60 and 96 95 1 2

linguistic grammar based techniques as well as statistical models hand crafted grammar based systems typically obtain better precision but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists statistical ner systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data edit problem domains research indicates that even state of the art ner systems are brittle meaning that ner systems developed for one domain do not typically perform well on other domains 3 considerable effort is involved in tuning ner systems to perform well in a new domain this is true for both rule based and trainable statistical systems early work in ner systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports later stages of the automatic content extraction ace evaluation also included several types of informal text styles such as weblogs and text transcripts from conversational telephone speech conversations since about 1998 there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology bioinformatics and medical natural language processing communities the most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products edit named entity types in the expression named entity the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many rigid designators as defined by kripke stands for the referent for instance the automotive company created by henry ford in 1903 is referred to as ford or ford motor company rigid designators include proper names as well as certain natural kind terms like biological species and substances there is a general agreement to include temporal expressions and some numerical expressions i e money percentages etc as instances of named entities in the context of the ner task while some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators e g the year 2001 there are also many invalid ones e g i take my vacations in june in the first case the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the gregorian calendar in the second case the month june may refer to the month of an undefined year past june next june june 2020 etc it is arguable that the named entity definition is loosened in such cases for practical reasons the definition of the term named entity is therefore not strict and often has to be explained in the context it is used 4 at least two hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature bbn categories proposed in 2002 is used for question answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes 5 sekine s extended hierarchy proposed in 2002 is made of 200 subtypes 6 edit current challenges and research despite the high f1 numbers reported on the muc 7 dataset the problem of named entity recognition is far from being solved the main efforts are directed to reducing the annotation labor 7 8 robust performance across domains 9 10 and scaling up to fine grained entity types 11 12 a recently emerging task of identifying important expressions in text and cross linking them to wikipedia 13 14 15 can be seen as an instance of extremely fine grained named entity recognition where the types are the actual wikipedia pages describing the potentially ambiguous concepts below is an example output of a
