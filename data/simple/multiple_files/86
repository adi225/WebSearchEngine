sanders peirce 1839 1914 did considerable work over a period of years on the classification of sciences including mathematics 2 his classifications are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath s survey of research in his time peirce himself was well grounded and produced work in many research fields including logic mathematics statistics philosophy spectroscopy gravimetry geodesy chemistry and experimental psychology 3 contents 1 the classifications 1 1 taxa 1 2 sciences 1 2 1 logic s divisions later 2 notes 3 references 4 external links edit the classifications philosophers have done little work on classification of the sciences and mathematics since peirce s time birger hj rland 4 in denmark has commented there is not today 2005 to my knowledge any organized research program about the classification of the sciences in any discipline or in any country as miksa 1998 writes the interest for this question largely died in the beginning of the 20th century 5 it is not clear that hj rland includes the classification of mathematics in that characterization hj rland also notes peirce s important contribution edit taxa in 1902 and 1903 peirce elaborates classifications of the sciences in his feb apr 1902 a detailed classification of the sciences collected papers of charles sanders peirce cp v 1 paragraphs 203 283 6 in his projected book minute logic his july 1902 application to the carnegie institution ms l75 7 and his 1903 an outline classification of the sciences cp 1 180 202 8 in his a syllabus of certain topics in logic wherein his classifications of the sciences take more or less their final form however only in the detailed classification and the carnegie application does he discuss the taxa which he used which were inspired by the biological taxa of louis agassiz 9 taxa of scientific departments name characterization a detailed classification of the sciences 10 feb apr 1902 characterization carnegie application 11 july 1902 examples 1902 examples are the carnegie application branch 160 of science branches differ in fundamental purposes throughout a branch there is one same animating motive though researchers in a branch s different classes seem to live in different worlds peirce s three branches 1903 science of discovery science of review practical science class 160 of science classes differ radically in observation observations in one class say physical amp psychological sciences cannot yield the kind of information which another class say pure mathematics requires of observation throughout a class researchers feel that they inquire into the same great subject as kinds of inquiry differ but interconnect peirce s three classes of discovery science pure mathematics cenoscopic philosophy the special sciences order 160 of science two orders within one class or subclass may differ hierarchically one more general the other more specialized 10 throughout an order researchers pursue the same general kind of inquiry but deal with different kinds of conceptions peirce s 1902 example of various orders general physics biology geology family 160 of science has special name journal society studies one group of facts researchers understand one another in a general way and naturally associate together throughout a family researchers have the same general conceptions but differ in skills peirce s 1902 example of various families astronomy geognosy genus 160 of science i can give no such definitions of genera and species not having carried my classification of the sciences to these minutiae of definitions of taxa he does use the genus taxon throughout the genus researchers have the same skills but differ in acquaintance with facts in detail peirce s 1902 example of various genera optics electrics species 160 of science the species is the narrowest division still having societies and journals each researcher is thoroughly well qualified in all parts of it peirce s 1902 example of various species entomology ichthyology variety 160 of science researchers devote lives to a variety of science but not so numerously as to support distinct societies and journals peirce s 1902 example of various varieties study of kant study of spinoza edit sciences in 1902 he divided science into theoretical and practical 12 theoretical science consisted of science of discovery and science of review the latter of which he also called synthetic philosophy a name taken from the title of the vast work written over many years by herbert spencer then in 1903 13 he made it a three way division science of discovery science of review and practical science in 1903 he characterized science of review as arranging the results of discovery beginning with digests and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science such is the nature of humboldt s cosmos of comte s philosophie positive and of spencer s synthetic philosophy the classification of the sciences belongs to this department 14 peirce had already for a while divided the sciences of discovery into 1 mathematics which draws necessary conclusions about hypothetical objects 2 cenoscopy 15 or philosophy about positive phenomena in general such as confront a person at every waking moment rather than special classes and not settling theoretical issues by special experiences or experiments and 3 idioscopy 15 or the special sciences about special classes of positive phenomena and settling theoretical issues by special experiences or experiments thus peirce ends up framing two fields each of which is philosophy in a sense cenoscopic philosophy which precedes the special sciences and synthetic philosophy that is to say science of review which does take advantage of the results of all the sciences of discovery and develops for instance classifications of the sciences peirce opens his 1903 classification the syllabus classification with a concise statement of method and purpose this classification which aims to base itself on the principal affinities of the objects classified is concerned not with all possible sciences nor with so many branches of knowledge but with sciences in their present condition as so many businesses of groups of living men it borrows its idea from comte s classification namely the idea that one science depends upon another for fundamental principles but does not furnish such principles to that other it turns out that in most cases the divisions are trichotomic the first of the three members relating to universal elements or laws the second arranging classes of forms and seeking to bring them under universal laws the third going into the utmost detail describing individual phenomena and endeavoring to explain them but not all the divisions are of this character 16 the following table is based mostly on peirce s 1903 classification which was more or less the final form but see after the table for discussion of his later remarks on the divisions of logic classification of the sciences of discovery classes subclasses orders other taxa suborders families etc i mathematics draws necessary conclusions about hypothetical objects a mathematics of logic b mathematics of discrete series c mathematics of continua and pseudocontinua note by continuum peirce meant until 1908 17 a continuum of instants as he called them beyond any cantorian aleph s worth 18 he held that such a continuum was the true subject matter of that which we now call topology and that the reals the complex reals etc constituted pseudocontinua ii cenoscopy or philosophy philosophia prima first philosophy about positive phenomena in general such as are available to every person at every waking moment and not about special classes of phenomena does not resort to special experiences or experiments in order to settle theoretical questions epist my 1902 classification only 19 a phenomenology or categorics or phaneroscopy includes the study of the cenopythagorean categories firstness secondness and thirdness b normative science i esthetics study of the good the admirable peirce reserved the spelling aesthetics for the study of artistic beauty ii ethics study of right and wrong iii logic or semiotic or formal semiotic study of true and false the presuppositions of reason are the locus of peirce s truth theory and his fallibilism 1 speculative grammar or philosophical or universal grammar or stechiology includes the classification of signs 2 critic or logical critic critical logic or logic proper includes study of the modes of inference abduction induction and deduction 3 methodeutic or speculative rhetoric or universal or philosophical rhetoric is the locus of peirce s pragmatism and includes study of scientific method c metaphysics i ontology or general locus of peirce s scholastic realism ii psychical or religious 1 god 2 freedom amp destiny 3 immortality iii physical locus of peirce s objective idealism and his doctrines that physical space time and law are continuous and that chance mechanical necessity and creative love are physically real and involve corresponding modes of universal evolution the ric 1902 classification only peirce the rics only resort to special observation to settle some minute details concerning which the testimony of general experience is possibly insufficient 19 chronotheory amp topotheory 1902 only iii idioscopy or the special sciences about special classes of positive phenomena resorts to special experience or experiments in order to settle theoretical questions physical i nomological or general i molar physics dynamics amp gravitation ii molecular physics elaterics elasticity expansibility 20 amp thermodynamics iii ethereal physics optics amp electrics ii classificatory peirce in the 1903 syllabus classification 21 classificatory physics seems at present as a matter of fact to be divided quite irrationally and most unequally into i crystallography ii chemistry iii biology i crystallography ii chemistry 1 physical 2 organic aliphatic amp aromatic 3 inorganic elements atomic weights compounds periodicity etc iii biology 1 physiology 2 anatomy iii descriptive geognosy amp astronomy psychical i nomological psychics or psychology i introspectional ii experimental iii physiological iv child ii classificatory psychics or ethnology 1 special psychology 1 individual psychology 2 psychical heredity 3 abnormal psychology 4 mob psychology 5 race psychology 6 animal psychology 2 linguistics 1 word linguistics 2 grammar should be a comparative science of forms of composition 22 3 ethnology 1 ethnology of social developments customs laws religion and tradition 2 ethnology of technology iii descriptive psychics or history 1 history proper 2 biography which at present is rather a mass of lies than a science 23 3 criticism 1 literary criticism 2 art criticism criticism of military operations criticism of architecture etc edit logic s divisions later in a piece which the collected papers editors called phaneroscopy and dated as 1906 peirce wrote cp 4 9 24 i extend logic to embrace all the necessary principles of semeiotic and i recognize a logic of icons and a logic of indices as well as a logic of symbols and in this last i recognize three divisions stecheotic or stoicheiology which i formerly called speculative grammar critic which i formerly called logic and methodeutic which i formerly called speculative rhetoric thus the three main 1903 departments of logic were now sub departments of the study of the logic of symbols in a letter to j h kehler printed in the new elements of mathematics v 3 p 160 207 and dated 1911 25 peirce wrote i have now sketched my doctrine of logical critic skipping a good deal i recognize two other parts of logic one which may be called analytic examines the nature of thought not psychologically but simply to define what it is to doubt to believe to learn etc and then to base critic on these definitions is my real method though in this letter i have taken the third branch of logic methodeutic which shows how to conduct an inquiry this is what the greater part of my life has been devoted to though i base it upon critic peirce s revisions of logic s divisions peirce in 1902 1903 logic begins on general level with presuppositions of reason logical conception of mind nature of belief amp doubt etc a stechiology 160 classes of signs amp 160 their combinations b critic 160 modes of argument c methodeutic 160 methods of inquiry peirce in 1906 logic a logic of icons b logic of indices c logic of symbols 160 c1 stechiotic 160 c2 critic 160 c3 methodeutic peirce in 1911 logic a analytic 160 what it is to doubt 160 to believe to learn b critic c methodeutic there in 1911 peirce does not mention the 1906 division into logics of icons indices and symbols critic and methodeutic appear as in 1902 and 1903 as the second and third main departments of logic analytic is now the first department and the word stechiology goes unused he includes in analytic the consideration of issues which back in his 1902 carnegie institute application he had discussed in sections on logic with such headings in the final version as presuppositions of logic 26 and on the logical conception of mind 27 that he had placed before the sections on logic s departments stechiology critic and methodeutic 28 on the question of the relationship between stechiology and the analytic that seems to have replaced it note that in draft d of memoir 15 29 in his 1902 carnegie institute application peirce said that stechiology also called grammatica speculativa amounts to an erkenntnisslehre a theory of cognition provided that that theory is stripped of matter irrelevant and inadmissible in philosophical logic irrelevant matter such as all truths for example the association of ideas established by psychologists insofar as the special science of psychology depends on logic not vice versa in that same carnegie institute application as in many other places peirce treated belief doubt etc as issues of philosophical logic apart from psychology edit notes brent joseph 1998
