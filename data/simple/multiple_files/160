a data visualization of wikipedia as part of the world wide web demonstrating hyperlinks data visualization is the study of the visual representation of data meaning information that has been abstracted in some schematic form including attributes or variables for the units of information 1 contents 1 overview 2 data visualization scope 3 related fields 3 1 data acquisition 3 2 data analysis 3 3 data governance 3 4 data management 3 5 data mining 3 6 data transforms 4 data visualization software 5 see also 6 references 7 further reading 8 external links edit overview a data visualization from social media according to friedman 2008 the main goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and effectively through graphical means it doesn t mean that data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or extremely sophisticated to look beautiful to convey ideas effectively both aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand providing insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicating its key aspects in a more intuitive way yet designers often fail to achieve a balance between form and function creating gorgeous data visualizations which fail to serve their main purpose to communicate information 2 indeed fernanda viegas and martin m wattenberg have suggested that an ideal visualization should not only communicate clearly but stimulate viewer engagement and attention 3 data visualization is closely related to information graphics information visualization scientific visualization and statistical graphics in the new millennium data visualization has become an active area of research teaching and development according to post et al 2002 it has united scientific and information visualization 4 brian willison has demonstrated that data visualization has also been linked to enhancing agile software development and customer engagement 5 kpi library has developed the periodic table of visualization methods an interactive chart displaying various data visualization methods it includes six types of data visualization methods data information concept strategy metaphor and compound citation needed edit data visualization scope there are different approaches on the scope of data visualization one common focus is on information presentation such as friedman 2008 presented it on this way friendly 2008 presumes two main parts of data visualization statistical graphics and thematic cartography 1 in this line the data visualization modern approaches 2007 article gives an overview of seven subjects of data visualization 6 mindmaps displaying news displaying data displaying connections displaying websites articles amp resources tools and services all these subjects are closely related to graphic design and information representation on the other hand from a computer science perspective frits h post 2002 categorized the field into a number of sub fields 4 visualization algorithms and techniques volume visualization information visualization multiresolution methods modelling techniques and interaction techniques and architectures for different types of visualizations and their connection to infographics see infographics edit related fields edit data acquisition data acquisition is the sampling of the real world to generate data that can be manipulated by a computer sometimes abbreviated daq or das data acquisition typically involves acquisition of signals and waveforms and processing the signals to obtain desired information the components of data acquisition systems include appropriate sensors that convert any measurement parameter to an electrical signal which is acquired by data acquisition hardware edit data analysis data analysis is the process of studying and summarizing data with the intent to extract useful information and develop conclusions data analysis is closely related to data mining but data mining tends to focus on larger data sets with less emphasis on making inference and often uses data that was originally collected for a different purpose in statistical applications some people divide data analysis into descriptive statistics exploratory data analysis and inferential statistics or confirmatory data analysis where the eda focuses on discovering new features in the data and cda on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses types of data analysis are exploratory data analysis eda an approach to analyzing data for the purpose of formulating hypotheses worth testing complementing the tools of conventional statistics for testing hypotheses it was so named by john tukey qualitative data analysis qda or qualitative research is the analysis of non numerical data for example words photographs observations etc edit data governance data governance encompasses the people processes and technology required to create a consistent enterprise view of an organisation s data in order to increase consistency amp confidence in decision making decrease the risk of regulatory fines improve data security maximize the income generation potential of data designate accountability for information quality edit data management data management comprises all the academic disciplines related to managing data as a valuable resource the official definition provided by dama is that data resource management is the development and execution of architectures policies practices and procedures that properly manage the full data lifecycle needs of an enterprise this definition is fairly broad and encompasses a number of professions that may not have direct technical contact with lower level aspects of data management such as relational database management edit data mining data mining is the process of sorting through large amounts of data and picking out relevant information it is usually used by business intelligence organizations and financial analysts but is increasingly being used in the sciences to extract information from the enormous data sets generated by modern experimental and observational methods it has been described as the nontrivial extraction of implicit previously unknown and potentially useful information from data 7 and the science of extracting useful information from large data sets or databases 8 in relation to enterprise resource planning according to monk 2006 data mining is the statistical and logical analysis of large sets of transaction data looking for patterns that can aid decision making 9 edit data transforms data transforms is the process of automation and transformation of both real time and offline data from one format to another there are standards and protocols that provide the specifications and rules and it usually occurs in the process pipeline of aggregation or consolidation or interoperability the primary use cases are in integration systems organizations and compliance personnels edit data visualization software software
