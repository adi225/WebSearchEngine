is the art and science of organizing and labelling data including websites intranets online communities and software to support usability 1 it is an emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing together principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape 2 page 160 needed typically it involves a model or concept of information which is used and applied to activities that require explicit details of complex information systems these activities include library systems and database development historically the term information architect is attributed to

digital landscape 2 page 160 needed edit debate the difficulty in establishing a common definition for information architecture arises partly from the term s existence in multiple fields in the field of systems design for example information architecture is a component of enterprise architecture that deals with the information component when describing the structure of an enterprise while the definition of information architecture is relatively well established in the field of systems design it is much more debatable within the context of online information systems i e websites andrew dillon refers to the latter as the big ia little ia debate 5 in the little ia view information architecture is essentially the application of information science to web design which considers for example issues of classification and information retrieval in the big ia view information architecture involves more than just the organization of a website it also factors in user experience thereby considering usability issues of information design edit the role of ia information architecture is a specialized skill set that interprets information and expresses distinctions between signs and systems of signs more concretely it involves the categorization of information into a coherent structure preferably one that the intended audience can understand quickly if not inherently and then easily retrieve the information for which they are searching 2 page 160 needed the organization structure is usually hierarchical but can have other structures such as concentric or even chaotic 2 page 160 needed typically this is required in activities such as library systems content management systems web development user interactions database development programming technical writing enterprise architecture and critical system software design information architecture originates to some degree in the library sciences many schools with library and information science departments teach information architecture 6 in the context of information systems design information architecture refers to the analysis and design of the data stored by information systems concentrating on entities their attributes and their interrelationships it refers to the modeling of data for an individual database and to the corporate data models that an enterprise uses to coordinate the definition of data in several perhaps scores or hundreds distinct databases the canonical data model is applied to integration technologies as a definition for specific data passed between the systems of an enterprise at a higher level of abstraction it may also refer to the definition of data stores edit information architect richard saul wurman says of the term information architect used in the words architect of foreign policy i mean architect as in the creating of systemic structural and orderly principles to make something work the thoughtful making of either artifact or idea or policy that informs because it is clear 3 page 160 needed edit see also alexandre pierre gaspar application architecture business analyst card sorting chief experience officer cxo controlled vocabulary data
