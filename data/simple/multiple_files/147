data extraction is the act or process of retrieving data out of usually unstructured or poorly structured data sources for further data processing or data storage data migration the import into the intermediate extracting system is thus usually followed by data transformation and possibly the addition of metadata prior to export to another stage in the data workflow 1 usually the term data extraction is applied when experimental data is first imported into a computer from primary sources like measuring or recording devices today s electronic devices will usually present a electrical connector e g usb through which raw data can be streamed into a personal computer typical unstructured data sources include web pages emails documents pdfs scanned text mainframe reports spool files etc extracting data from these unstructured sources has grown into a considerable technical challenge where as historically data extraction has had to deal with changes in physical hardware formats the majority of current data extraction deals with extracting data from these unstructured data sources and from different software formats this growing process of data extraction from the web is referred to as web scraping the act of adding structure to unstructured data takes a number of forms using text pattern matching such as regular expressions to identify small or large scale structure e g records in a report and their associated data from headers and footers using a table based approach to identify common sections within a limited domain e g in emailed resumes identifying skills previous work experience qualifications etc using a standard set of commonly used headings these would differ from language to language e g education might be found under education qualification courses using text analytics to attempt to understand the text and link it to other information edit notes definition of data extraction edit external links data extraction as a part of the etl process in a data warehousing environment data extraction is a pioneer in data extraction tasks v t e data warehouse 160 creating the data warehouse concepts database dimension dimensional modeling fact olap star schema aggregate variants anchor modeling column oriented dbms data vault modeling holap molap rolap operational data store elements data dictionary metadata data mart sixth normal form surrogate key fact fact table early arriving fact measure dimension dimension table degenerate slowly changing filling extract transform load etl extract transform load 160 using the data warehouse concepts business intelligence dashboard data mining decision support system dss olap cube languages data mining extensions dmx multidimensional expressions mdx xml for analysis xmla tools business intelligence tools reporting software spreadsheet 160 related people bill inmon ralph kimball products comparison of olap servers data warehousing products and their producers
