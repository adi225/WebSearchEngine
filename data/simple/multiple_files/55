cell culture vials the university of florida cancer and genetics research complex is one of the largest medical research facilities in the united states the all india institute of medical sciences is one of the largest medical schools in asia biomedical research or experimental medicine in general simply known as medical research is the basic research applied research or translational research conducted to aid and support the body of knowledge in the field of medicine medical research can be divided into two general categories the evaluation of new treatments for both safety and efficacy in what are termed clinical trials and all other research that contributes to the development of new treatments the latter is termed preclinical research if its goal is specifically to elaborate knowledge for the development of new therapeutic strategies a new paradigm to biomedical research is being termed translational research which focuses on iterative feedback loops between the basic and clinical research domains to accelerate knowledge translation from the bedside to the bench and back again medical research may involve doing research on public health biochemistry clinical research microbiology physiology oncology surgery and research on many other non communicable diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases the increased longevity of humans over the past century can be significantly attributed to advances resulting from medical research among the major benefits have been vaccines for measles and polio insulin treatment for diabetes classes of antibiotics for treating a host of maladies medication for high blood pressure improved treatments for aids statins and other treatments for atherosclerosis new surgical techniques such as microsurgery and increasingly successful treatments for cancer new beneficial tests and treatments are expected as a result of the human genome project many challenges remain however including the appearance of antibiotic resistance and the obesity epidemic most of the research in the field is pursued by biomedical scientists however significant contributions are made by other biologists as well as chemists and physicists medical research done on humans has to strictly follow the medical ethics as sanctioned in the declaration of helsinki and elsewhere in all cases the research ethics has to be respected

research preclinical research is research in basic science which precedes the clinical trials and is almost purely based on theory and animal experiments much of these experiments involve preclinical imaging modalities to aid in vivo longitudinal studies new treatments come about as a result of other earlier discoveries often unconnected to each other and in various fields sometimes the research is done for non medical purposes and only by accident contributes to the field of medicine for example the discovery of penicillin clinicians use these discoveries to create a treatment regimen which is then tested in clinical trials edit clinical trials main article clinical trial a clinical trial is a comparison test of a medication or other medical treatment versus a placebo other medications and devices or the standard medical treatment for a patient s condition clinical trials vary greatly in size from a single researcher in one hospital or clinic to an international multicenter trial with several hundred participating researchers on several continents the number of patients tested can range from as few as a dozen to several thousands edit funding main article research funding the headquarters of the wellcome trust in london united kingdom research funding in many countries comes from research bodies which distribute money for equipment and salaries in the united kingdom funding bodies such as the medical research council derive their assets from uk tax payers and distribute this to institutions in a competitive manner the wellcome trust is the uk s largest non governmental source of funds for biomedical research and provides over 600 million per year in grants to scientists and funds for research centres 1 in the united states the most recent data from 2003 2 suggest that about 94 billion dollars were provided for biomedical research in the united states the national institutes of health and pharmaceutical companies collectively contribute 26 4 billion dollars and 27 0 billion dollars respectively which constitute 28 and 29 of the total respectively other significant contributors include biotechnology companies 17 9 billion dollars 19 of total medical device companies 9 2 billion dollars 10 of total other federal sources and state and local governments foundations and charities led by the bill and melinda gates foundation contributed about 3 of the funding in australia in 2000 01 the most recent data available about 1 7b was spent on biomedical research 3 with just under half 800m 47 sourced from the commonwealth government all sources about 540m came from business investments funding and a further 220m from private or not for profit organisations totalling 44 the balance was from state and local governments since then there has been a significant in government funding through the national health and medical research council nhmrc whose expenditure on research was nearly a 700 million in 2008 09 4 the enactment of orphan drug legislation in some countries has increased funding available to develop drugs meant to treat rare conditions resulting in breakthroughs that previously were uneconomical to pursue edit regulations and guidelines medical research is highly regulated national regulatory authorities oversee and monitor medical research such as for the development of new drugs in the usa the food and drug administration oversees new drug development in europe the european medicines agency see also eudralex and in japan the ministry of health labour and welfare japan the world medical association develops the ethical standards for the medical profession involved in medical research the most fundamental of them is the declaration of helsinki the international conference on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use ich works on the creation of rules and guidelines for the development of new medication such as the guidelines for good clinical practice gcp all ideas of regulation are based on a country s ethical standards code this is why treatment of a particular disease in one country may not be allowed but is in another edit
