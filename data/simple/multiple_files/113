sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed may 2008 computer music is a term that was originally used within academia to describe a field of study relating to the applications of computing technology in music composition particularly that stemming from the western art music tradition it includes the theory and application of new and existing technologies in music such as sound synthesis digital signal processing sound design sonic diffusion acoustics and psychoacoustics the field of computer music can trace its roots back to the origin of electronic music and the very first experiments and innovations with electronic instruments at the turn of the 20th century more recently with the advent of personal computing and the growth of home recording the term computer music is now sometimes used to describe any music that has been created using computing technology contents 1 history 2 advances 3 research 4 computer generated music 4 1 music composed and performed by

much of the work on computer music has drawn on the relationship between music theory and mathematics the world s first computer to play music was csirac which was designed and built by trevor pearcey and maston beard mathematician geoff hill programmed the csirac to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s in 1951 it publicly played the colonel bogey march 1 of which no known recordings exist however csirac played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice which is current computer music practice the oldest known recordings of computer generated music were played by the ferranti mark 1 computer a commercial version of the baby machine from the university of manchester in the autumn of 1951 the music program was written by christopher strachey during a session recorded by the bbc the machine managed to work its way through baa baa black sheep god save the king and part of in the mood 2 two further major 1950s developments were the origins of digital sound synthesis by computer and of algorithmic composition programs beyond rote playback max mathews at bell laboratories developed the influential music i program and its descendents further popularising computer music through a 1962 article in science amongst other pioneers the musical chemists lejaren hiller and leonard isaacson worked on a series of algorithmic composition experiments from 1956 9 manifested in the 1957 premiere of the illiac suite for string quartet 3 in japan experiments in computer music date back to 1962 when keio university professor sekine and toshiba engineer hayashi experimented with the tosbac computer this resulted in a piece entitled tosbac suite influenced by the illiac suite later japanese computer music compositions include a piece by kenjiro ezaki presented during osaka expo 70 and panoramic sonore 1974 by music critic akimichi takeda ezaki also published an article called contemporary music and computers in 1970 since then japanese research in computer music has largely been carried out for commercial purposes in popular music though some of the more serious japanese musicians used large computer systems such as the fairlight in the 1970s 4 early computer music programs typically did not run in real time programs would run for hours or days on multi million dollar computers to generate a few minutes of music 5 6 one way around this was to use a hybrid system most notably the roland mc 8 microcomposer where a microprocessor based system controls an analog synthesizer released in 1978 4 john chowning s work on fm synthesis from the 1960s to the 1970s allowed much more efficient digital synthesis 7 eventually leading to the development of the affordable fm synthesis based yamaha dx7 digital synthesizer released in 1983 8 in addition to the yamaha dx7 the advent of inexpensive digital chips and microcomputers opened the door to real time generation of computer music 8 in the 1980s japanese personal computers such as the nec pc 88 came installed with fm synthesis sound chips and featured audio programming languages such as music macro language mml and midi interfaces which were most often used to produce video game music or chiptunes 4 by the early 1990s the performance of microprocessor based computers reached the point that real time generation of computer music using more general programs and algorithms became possible 9 interesting sounds must have a fluidity and changeability that allows them to remain fresh to the ear in computer music this subtle ingredient is bought at a high computational cost both in terms of the number of items requiring detail in a score and in the amount of interpretive work the instruments must produce to realize this detail in sound 10 edit advances advances in computing power and software for manipulation of digital media have dramatically affected the way computer music is generated and performed current generation micro computers are powerful enough to perform very sophisticated audio synthesis using a wide variety of algorithms and approaches computer music systems and approaches are now ubiquitous and so firmly embedded in the process of creating music that we hardly give them a second thought computer based synthesizers digital mixers and effects units have become so commonplace that use of digital rather than analog technology to create and record music is the norm rather than the exception citation needed edit research despite the ubiquity of computer music in contemporary culture there is considerable activity in the field of computer music as researchers continue to pursue new and interesting computer based synthesis composition and performance approaches throughout the world there are many organizations and institutions dedicated to the area of computer and electronic music study and research including the icma international computer music association ircam grame seamus society for electro acoustic music in the united states cec canadian electroacoustic community and a great number of institutions of higher learning around the world edit computer generated music computer generated music is music composed by or with the extensive aid of a computer although any music which uses computers in its composition or realisation is computer generated to some extent the use of computers is now so widespread in the editing of pop songs for instance that the phrase computer generated music is generally used to mean a kind of music which could not have been created without the use of computers citation needed we can distinguish two groups of computer generated music music in which a computer generated the score which could be performed by humans and music which is both composed and performed by computers there is a large genre of music that is organized synthesized and created on computers citation needed edit music composed and performed by computers main article algorithmic composition see also generative music evolutionary music 160 and genetic algorithm later composers such as gottfried michael koenig had computers generate the sounds of the composition as well as the score koenig produced algorithmic composition programs which were a generalisation of his own serial composition practice this is not exactly similar to xenakis work as he used mathematical abstractions and examined how far he could explore these musically koenig s software translated the calculation of mathematical equations into codes which represented musical notation this could be converted into musical notation by hand and then performed by human players his programs project 1 and project 2 are examples of this kind of software later he extended the same kind of principles into the realm of synthesis enabling the computer to produce the sound directly ssp is an example of a program which performs this kind of function all of these programs were produced by koenig at the institute of sonology in utrecht in the 1970s citation needed procedures such as those used by koenig and xenakis are still in use today citation needed since the invention of the midi system in the early 1980s for example some people have worked on programs which map midi notes to an algorithm and then can either output sounds or music through the computer s sound card or write an audio file for other programs to play citation needed some of these simple programs are based on fractal geometry and can map midi notes to specific fractals or fractal equations although such programs are widely available and are sometimes seen as clever toys for the non musician some professional musicians have given them attention also the resulting music can be more like noise or can sound quite familiar and pleasant as with much algorithmic music and algorithmic art in general more depends on the way in which the parameters are mapped to aspects of these equations than on the equations themselves thus for example the same equation can be made to produce both a lyrical and melodic piece of music in the style of the mid nineteenth century and a fantastically dissonant cacophony more reminiscent of the avant garde music of the 1950s and 1960s citation needed other programs can map mathematical formulae and constants to produce sequences of notes in this manner an irrational number can give an infinite sequence of notes where each note is a digit in the decimal expression of that number this sequence can in turn be a composition in itself or simply the basis for further elaboration citation needed operations such as these and even more elaborate operations can also be performed in computer music programming languages such as max msp supercollider csound pure data pd keykit and chuck these programs now easily run on most personal computers and are often capable of more complex functions than those which would have necessitated the most powerful mainframe computers several decades ago citation needed there exist programs that generate human sounding melodies by using a vast database of phrases one example is band in a box which is capable of creating jazz blues and rock instrumental solos with almost no user interaction another is impro visor which uses a stochastic context free grammar to generate phrases and complete solos citation needed another cybernetic approach to computer composition uses specialized hardware to detect external stimuli which are then mapped by the computer to realize the performance examples of this style of computer music can be found in the middle 80 s work of david rokeby very nervous system where audience performer motions are translated to midi segments computer controlled music is also found in the performance pieces by the canadian composer udo kasemets such as the marce ntennia l circus c ag elebrating duchamp 1987 a realization of the marcel duchamp process piece erratum musical using an electric model train to collect a hopper car of stones to be deposited on a drum wired to an analog digital converter mapping the stone impacts to a score display performed in toronto by pianist gordon monahan during the 1987 duchamp centennial or his installations and performance works e g spectrascapes based on his geo sono scope 1986 15x4 channel computer controlled audio mixer in these latter works the computer generates sound scapes from tape loop sound samples live shortwave or sine wave generators citation needed edit computer generated scores for performance by human players many systems for generating musical scores actually existed well before the time of computers one of these was musikalisches w rfelspiel musical dice game 18th century a system which used throws of the dice to randomly select measures from a large collection of small phrases when patched together these phrases combined to create musical pieces which could be performed by human players although these works were not actually composed with a computer in the modern sense it uses a rudimentary form of the random combinatorial techniques sometimes used in computer generated composition citation needed the world s first digital computer music was generated in australia by programmer geoff hill on the csirac computer which was designed and built by trevor pearcey and maston beard although it was only used to play standard tunes of the day subsequently one of the first composers to write music with a computer was iannis xenakis he wrote programs in the fortran language that generated numeric data that he transcribed into scores to be played by traditional musical instruments an example is st 48 of 1962 although xenakis could well have composed this music by hand the intensity of the calculations needed to transform probabilistic mathematics into musical notation was best left to the number crunching power of the computer citation needed computers have also been used in an attempt to imitate the music of great composers of the past such as mozart a present exponent of this technique is david cope he wrote computer programs that analyse works of other composers to produce new works in a similar style he has used this program to great effect with composers such as bach and mozart his program experiments in musical intelligence is famous for creating mozart s 42nd symphony and also within his own pieces combining his own creations with that of the computer citation needed melomics a research group from the university of m laga spain developed a computer composition cluster named iamus computer which composes complex multi instrument pieces for editing and performance since its inception iamus computer has composed a full album in 2012 appropriately named iamus album which new scientist described as the first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra 11 the group has also developed an api for developers to utilize the technology and makes its music available on its website edit computer aided algorithmic composition diagram illustrating the position of caac in relation to other generative music systems computer aided algorithmic composition caac pronounced sea ack is the implementation and use of algorithmic composition techniques in software this label is derived from the combination of two labels each too vague for continued use the label computer aided composition lacks the specificity of using generative algorithms music produced with notation or sequencing software could easily be considered computer aided composition the label algorithmic composition is likewise too broad particularly in that it does not specify the use of a computer the term computer aided rather than computer assisted is used in the same manner as computer aided design citation needed edit machine improvisation see also machine learning machine listening artificial intelligence 160 and neural networks machine improvisation uses computer algorithms to create improvisation on existing music materials this is usually done by sophisticated recombination of musical phrases extracted from existing music either live or pre recorded in order to achieve credible improvisation in particular style machine improvisation uses machine learning and pattern matching algorithms to analyze existing musical examples the resulting patterns are then used to create new variations in the style of the original music developing a notion of stylistic reinjection this is different from other improvisation methods with computers that use algorithmic composition to generate new music without performing analysis of existing music examples citation needed edit statistical style modeling style modeling implies building a computational representation of the musical surface that captures important stylistic features from data statistical approaches are used to capture the redundancies in terms of pattern dictionaries or repetitions which are later recombined to generate new musical data style mixing can be realized by analysis of a database containing multiple musical examples in different styles machine improvisation builds upon a long musical tradition of statistical modeling that began with hiller and isaacson s illiac suite for string quartet 1957 and xenakis uses of markov chains and stochastic processes modern methods include the use of lossless data compression for incremental parsing prediction suffix tree and string searching by factor oracle algorithm basically a factor oracle is a nite state automaton constructed in linear time and space in an incremental fashion 12 edit uses of machine improvisation machine improvisation encourages musical creativity by providing automatic modeling and transformation structures for existing music citation needed this creates a natural interface with the musician without need for coding musical algorithms in live performance the system re injects the musician s material in several different ways allowing a semantics level representation of the session and a smart recombination and transformation of this material in real time in offline version machine improvisation can be used to achieve style mixing an approach inspired by vannevar bush s memex imaginary machine citation needed edit implementations the first system implementing machine improvisation by means of markov models and style modeling techniques is the continuator developed by fran ois pachet at sony csl paris in 2002 13 14 matlab implementation of the factor oracle machine improvisation can be found as part of computer audition toolbox omax is a software environment developed in ircam omax uses openmusic and max it is based on researches on stylistic modeling carried out by gerard assayag and shlomo dubnov and on researches on improvisation with the computer by g assayag m chemillier and g bloch aka the omax brothers in the ircam music representations group

composer hamburg pa usa edit live coding main article live coding live coding 15 sometimes known as interactive programming on the fly programming 16 just in time programming is the name given to the process of writing software in realtime as part of a performance recently it has been explored as a more rigorous alternative to laptop musicians who live coders often feel lack the charisma and pizzazz of musicians performing live 17 generally this practice stages a more general approach one of interactive programming of writing parts of programs while they are interpreted traditionally most computer music programs have tended toward the old write compile run model which evolved when computers were much less powerful this approach has locked out code level innovation by people whose programming skills are more modest some programs have gradually integrated real time controllers and gesturing for example midi driven software synthesis and parameter control until recently however the musician composer rarely had the capability of real time modification of program code itself this legacy distinction is somewhat erased by languages such as chuck supercollider and impromptu citation needed toplap an ad hoc conglomerate of artists interested in live coding was formed in 2004 and promotes the use proliferation and exploration of a range of software languages and techniques
