pron o f r is a tcp ip application layer protocol designed for distributing searching and retrieving documents over the internet strongly oriented towards a menu document design the gopher protocol presented an alternative to the world wide web in its early stages but ultimately http became the dominant protocol the gopher ecosystem is often regarded as the effective predecessor of the world wide web invented by a team led by mark p mccahill at the university of minnesota the protocol offers some features not natively supported by the web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on information stored on it its text menu interface is easy to use 1 and well suited to computing environments that rely heavily on remote text oriented computer terminals which were still common at the time of its creation in 1991 and the simplicity of its protocol facilitated a wide variety of client implementations more recent gopher revisions and graphical clients added support for multimedia 1 gopher was preferred by many network administrators for using fewer network resources than web services 2 with its hierarchical structure gopher provided a useful platform for the first large scale electronic library connections 3 gopher users remember the system as being faster and more efficient and so much more organised than today s web services 4 although largely supplanted by the web in the years following the gopher protocol is still in use by enthusiasts and a small population of actively maintained servers remains contents 1 origins 2 a new user experience 3 stagnation 3 1 native

spring of 1991 by mark mccahill farhad anklesaria paul lindner daniel torrey and bob alberti of the university of minnesota 5 its central goals were as stated in rfc 1436 a file like hierarchical arrangement that would be familiar to users a simple syntax a system that can be created quickly and inexpensively extending the file system metaphor such as searches gopher combines document hierarchies with collections of services including wais the archie and veronica search engines and gateways to other information systems such as ftp and usenet the general interest in campus wide information systems cwiss 6 in higher education at the time and the ease with which a gopher server could be set up to create an instant cwis with links to other sites online directories and resources were the factors contributing to gopher s rapid adoption by 1992 the standard method of locating someone s e mail address was to find their organization s ccso nameserver entry in gopher and query the nameserver 7 the name was coined by anklesaria 8 as a play off of several meanings of the word gopher the university of minnesota mascot is the gopher 9 a gofer same sound is an assistant who goes for things and a gopher burrows through the ground to reach a desired location edit a new user experience contemporary accounts 10 offer a glimpse of what using gopher was like when the program burst onto the scene unified several resources and created gopher space on a screen with 25 lines of 80 green characters each no graphics then long since remedied you got a series of hierarchical menus the top level menu might be all the departments and publications e g the campus newspaper of your university which had invested in running a gopher server as a way of delivering documents electronically at least to the local community there were no search engines as we know them today available information was presented in a series of nested menus intended to resemble a hierarchical file system of folders something familiar to computer users who saw any search for information as trying to find that particular file document which held a particular answer if you wanted recent news for the women s volleyball team you would go to the daily crimson newspaper menu item and choose the word search of latest month item when asked to enter a search string you would enter the word volleyball all articles in the local daily crimson newspaper from the last month that contained the word volleyball would be listed as a separate menu you could select which one to get first in part for lack of bandwidth the system s presentation was intended to appear as listings of files without their content there were no paragraphs from inside the hits each with the word volleyball in boldface type and if you don t know what the newspaper is called or even if it is available searching a top level menu called keyword search of all gopher menus with a keyword daily would get you into the daily crimson publication you wanted for your volleyball search note that this core gopher functionality searches one publication in one location only the campus newspaper at a local university nevertheless the system was robust and its power soon grew the sys admins setting up any local gopher server had freedom to change menu hierarchies and names independently of the underlying file systems what enabled gopher to give so many who worked with it a foretaste of the world wide web yet to come was the ability to add links to other gopher servers around the world now users could hop from one server to another in gopher space the first cloud without thinking about a single underlying network address true to actually get the text you wanted you had to click on several links and read through a menu each time before you choose another link yet that worked more rapidly than people might think today and in the heyday of gopher much time was spent choosing and organizing links in layouts that could be grasped at a glance gopher became the text handling document delivery system it was intended to be a user could display a text document on her screen save it to a file print it out or even e mail a copy to another person on the internet gopher became the dominant client for other information services wide area information servers wais ftp and archie a database of the files held by most of the major anonymous public ftp sites on the internet initially gopher could search only one wais database at a time and wais s relevance feedback tool find content similar documents was not available the world wide web added graphics to text but lost the menus it took a while for increased power in communication storage and computation bandwidth a thousand times broader 9600 baud modem to fiber optics arrays of disk drives each a thousand times larger under 1 gb to over 1 tb and cheap servers pc cpus a thousand times faster to permit us to regularly crawl the web and catalog it for search engines while gopher s menu system seems quaint we should remember the time between the decline in gopher usage and the arrival of search engine ascendency back then early world wide web users looked eagerly for lists of links my favorite links pages and users were anxious to bookmark good links that they might never find again without structured menus users had taken a step backwards but with less structure something with more generality and much greater power emerged by the dawn of the 21st century the world wide web edit stagnation the world wide web was in its infancy in 1991 and gopher services quickly became established by the late 1990s gopher had largely ceased expanding several factors contributed to gopher s stagnation in february 1993 the university of minnesota announced that it would charge licensing fees for the use of its implementation of the gopher server 11 as a consequence of this some users were concerned that a licensing fee would also be charged for independent implementations 12 13 users were scared away from gopher technology to the advantage of the web which cern disclaimed ownership of 14 in september 2000 the university of minnesota re licensed its gopher software under the gnu gpl 15 16 gopher client functionality was quickly duplicated by early web browsers such as mosaic which subsumed the protocol as part of their functions gopher has a more rigid structure compared to the free form html of the web with gopher every document has a defined format and type and the typical user navigates through a single server defined menu system to get to a particular document this can be quite different from the way a typical user might traverse documents on the web gopher remains in active use by its enthusiasts and there have been attempts to revive the use of gopher on modern platforms and mobile devices one such attempt is the overbite project which hosts various browser extensions and modern clients as of 2012 update there are approximately 160 gopher servers indexed by veronica 2 17 reflecting a slow growth from 2007 when there were fewer than 100 18 although many are infrequently updated within these servers veronica indexed approximately 2 5 million unique selectors a handful of new servers are set up every year by hobbyists over 50 have been set up and added to floodgap s list since 1999 19 a snapshot of gopherspace as it was in 2007 was circulated on bittorrent and is still available 20 due to the simplicity of the gopher protocol setting up new servers or adding gopher support to browsers is often done in a tongue in cheek manner principally on april fools day 21 22 edit native gopher support browser currently supported supported from supported until notes camino yes 1 0 current always uses port 70 classilla

allows versions of firefox and seamonkey that do not support gopher natively to access gopher servers plugins are also available for konqueror 30 and a proxy based extension for google chrome 31 edit gopher clients for mobile devices some have suggested that the bandwidth sparing simple interface of gopher would be a good match for mobile phones and personal digital assistants pdas 32 but so far mobile adaptations of html and xml and other simplified content have proven more popular the pygopherd server provides a built in wml front end to gopher sites served with it the early 2010s have seen a renewed interest in native gopher clients for popular smartphones overbite an open source client for android 1 5 was released in alpha stage in 2010 33 pocketgopher was also released in 2010 along with its source code for several java me compatible devices igopher was released in 2011 as a proprietary client for iphone and ipad devices edit other gopher clients gopher was at its height of popularity during a time when there were still many equally competing computer architectures and operating systems as such there are several gopher clients available for acorn risc os amigaos atari mint cms dos classic mac os mvs next os 2 warp most unix like operating systems vms windows 3 x and windows 9x gophervr was a client designed for 3d visualization and there is even a gopher client moo object the majority of these clients are hard 160 coded to work on tcp port 70 edit gopher to http gateways users of web browsers that have incomplete or no support for gopher can access content on gopher servers via a server gateway or proxy server that converts gopher menus into html known proxies are the floodgap public gopher proxy gopher proxy and the wikkagopher proxy similarly certain server packages such as gn and pygopherd have built in gopher to http interfaces squid proxy software gateways any gopher url to http content enabling any browser or web agent to access gopher content easily edit technical details the conceptualization of knowledge in gopher space or a cloud as specific information in a particular file and the prominence of the ftp influenced the technology and the resulting functionality of gopher edit gopher characteristics as part of its design goals gopher functions and appears much like a mountable read only global network file system and software such as gopherfs is available that can actually mount a gopher server as a fuse resource at a minimum whatever a person can do with data files on a cd rom they can do on gopher a gopher system consists of a series of hierarchical hyperlinkable menus the choice of menu items and titles is controlled by the administrator of the server the top level menu of a gopher server selecting the fun and games menu item takes the user to the fun and games menu similar to a file on a web server a file on a gopher server can be linked to as a menu item from any other gopher server many servers take advantage of this inter server linking to provide a directory of other servers that the user can access edit protocol the gopher protocol was first described in rfc 1436 iana has assigned tcp port 70 to the gopher protocol the protocol is simple to negotiate making it possible to browse without using a client a standard gopher session may therefore appear as follows reference 1cia world factbook archives

the client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a line feed a cr lf sequence this is the selector which identifies the document to be retrieved if the item selector were an empty line the default directory would be selected the server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection according to the protocol before the connection is closed the server should send a full stop i e a period character on a line by itself however as is the case here not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close the connection without returning the final full stop in this example the item sent back is a gopher menu a directory consisting of a sequence of lines each of which describes an item that can be retrieved most clients will display these as hypertext links and so allow the user to navigate through gopherspace by following the links 5 all lines in a gopher menu are terminated by cr lf and consist of five fields the item type as the very first character see below the display string i e the description text to display a selector i e a file system pathname host name i e the domain name of the server on which the item resides and port i e the port number used by that server the item type and display string are joined without a space the other fields are separated by the tab character because of the simplicity of the gopher protocol tools such as netcat make it possible to download gopher content easily from the command line echo jacks jack exe nc gopher example org 70 gt jack exe the protocol is also supported by curl as of 7 21 2 dev 34 edit gopher item types item types are described in gopher menus by a single number or case specific letter and act as hints to the client to tell it how to handle a specific media type in a menu analogous to a mime type every client necessarily must understand itemtypes 0 and 1 all known clients understand item types 0 through 9 g and s and all but the very oldest also understand file types h and i 0 plain text file 1 directory menu listing 2 cso search query 3 error message 4 binhex encoded text file 5 binary archive file 6 uuencoded text file 7 search engine query 8 telnet session pointer 9 binary file g gif image h html file i informational message i image file of unspecified format client decides how to display often used for jpeg images s audio file format primarily a wav file t tn3270 session pointer a list of additional file type definitions has continued to evolve over time with some clients supporting them and others not as such many servers assign the generic 9 to every binary file hoping that the client s computer will be able to correctly process the file edit url links historically to create a link to a web server get was used as a pseudo selector to simulate an http client request john goerzen created an addition 35 to the gopher protocol commonly referred to as url links that allows links to any protocol that supports urls for example to create a link to http gopher quux org the item type is h the display string is the title of the link the item selector is url http gopher quux org and the domain and port are that of the originating gopher server so that clients that do not support url links will query the server and receive an html redirection page edit related technology the master gopherspace search engine is veronica veronica offers a keyword search of all the public internet gopher server menu titles a veronica search produces a menu of gopher items each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source individual gopher servers may also use localized search engines specific to their content such as jughead and jugtail gophervr is a 3d virtual reality variant of the original gopher system edit
