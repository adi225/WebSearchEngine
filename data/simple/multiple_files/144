data collection is any process of preparing and collecting data for example as part of a process improvement or similar project the purpose of data collection is to obtain information to keep on record to make decisions about important issues or to pass information on to others data are primarily collected to provide information regarding a specific topic 1 data collection usually takes place early on in an improvement project and is often formalised through a data collection plan 2 which often contains the following activity pre collection activity 160 agree on goals target data definitions methods collection 160 data collection present findings 160 usually involves some form of sorting 3 analysis and or presentation prior to any data collection pre collection activity is one of the most crucial steps in the process it is often discovered too late that the value of their interview information is discounted as a consequence of poor sampling of both questions and informants and poor elicitation techniques 4 after pre collection activity is fully completed data collection in the field whether by interviewing or other methods can be carried out in a structured systematic and scientific way a formal data collection process is necessary as it ensures that data gathered are both defined and accurate and that subsequent decisions based on arguments embodied in the findings are valid 5 the process provides both a baseline from which to measure and in certain cases a target on what to improve other main types of collection include census sample survey and administrative by product and each with their respective advantages and disadvantages a census refers to data collection about everyone or everything in a group or statistical population and has advantages such as accuracy and detail and disadvantages such as cost and time a sampling is a data collection method that includes only part of the total population and has advantages such as cost and time and disadvantages such as accuracy and detail administrative by product data are collected as a byproduct of an organization s day to day operations and has advantages such as accuracy time simplicity and disadvantages such as no flexibility and lack of control 6 edit see also scientific data archiving data management experiment observational study sampling statistics statistical survey
