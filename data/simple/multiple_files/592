question to find the most likely meaning of the question being asked it does this by drawing upon its database of knowledge of discrete facts as these facts are stored in a form that the computer can understand the answer engine attempts to produce an answer to what it comprehends to be the question by logically deducing from them 5 for example if one were to type in what is the birth date of george w bush true knowledge would reason from the facts george w bush is a president george w bush is a human being a president is a subclass of human being date of creation is a more general form for birth date and the 6th of july is the date of creation for george w bush to produce the simple answer the 6th of july true knowledge differs from competitors like freebase and dbpedia in that they

for them includes wikipedia citation required and from user submission following a consistent format and detailed process for input 12 13 true knowledge strives to monitor this user submitted knowledge in multiple ways one method involves a system of checks and balances in some ways similar to wikipedia s allowing users to modify or agree disagree with information presented by true knowledge the system itself also assesses submitted information due the fact that the information is submitted as discrete facts that computers can understand the system is able to reject any facts that are semantically incompatible with other approved knowledge on november 21 2008 true knowledge announced on its official blog that over 100 000 facts had been added by beta users and as of august
