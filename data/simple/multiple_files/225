a filter bubble is a situation in which a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user such as location past click behaviour and search history and as a result users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles prime examples are google s personalised search results and facebook s personalised news stream the term was coined by internet activist eli pariser in his book by the same name according to pariser users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble pariser related an example in which one user searched google for bp and got investment news about british petroleum while another searcher got information about the deepwater horizon oil spill and that the two search results pages were strikingly different 1 2 3 4 the bubble effect may have negative implications for civic discourse according to pariser but there are contrasting views suggesting the effect is minimal 4 and addressable 5 contents 1 concept 2 reactions 3 related concepts 4

these algorithms 1 other terms have been used to describe this phenomenon including ideological frames 2 or a figurative sphere surrounding you as you search the internet 6 the past search history is built up over time when an internet user indicates interest in topics by clicking links viewing friends putting movies in your queue reading news stories and so forth 6 an internet firm then uses this information to target advertising to the user or make it appear more prominently in a search results query page 6 pariser s concern is somewhat similar to one made by tim berners lee in a 2010 report in the guardian along the lines of a hotel california effect which happens when internet social networking sites were walling off content from other competing sites as a way of grabbing a greater share of all internet users such that the more you enter the more you become locked in to the information within a specific internet site 7 it becomes a closed silo of content with the risk of fragmenting the worldwide web according to berners lee 7 in the filter bubble pariser warns that a potential downside to filtered searching is that it closes us off to new ideas subjects and important information 8 and creates the impression that our narrow self interest is all that exists 2 it is potentially harmful to both individuals and society in his view he criticized google and facebook for offering users too much candy and not enough carrots 9 he warned that invisible algorithmic editing of the web may limit our exposure to new information and narrow our outlook according to pariser the detrimental effects of filter bubbles include harm to the general society in the sense that it has the possibility of undermining civic discourse and making people more vulnerable to propaganda and manipulation 2 he wrote a world constructed from the familiar is a world in which there s nothing to learn since there is invisible autopropaganda indoctrinating us with our own ideas eli pariser in the economist 2011 10 edit reactions there are conflicting reports about the extent to which personalised filtering is happening and whether such activity is beneficial or harmful analyst jacob weisberg writing in slate magazine did a small non scientific experiment to test pariser s theory which involved five associates with different ideological backgrounds conducting exactly the same search the results of all five search queries were nearly identical across four different searches suggesting that a filter bubble was not in effect which led him to write that a situation in which all people are feeding at the trough of a daily me was overblown 2 a wharton study 11 found that these filters can actually create commonality not fragmentation in online music taste consumers apparently use the filter to expand their taste not limit it 11 book reviewer paul boutin did a similar experiment among people with differing search histories and found results similar to weisberg s with nearly identical search results 4 harvard law professor jonathan zittrain disputed the extent to which personalisation filters distort google search results he said the effects of search personalization have been light 2 further there are reports that users can shut off personalisation features on google if they choose 12 by deleting the web history 4 and by other methods a spokesperson for google suggested that algorithms were added to google search engines to deliberately limit personalization and promote variety 2 nevertheless there are reports that google and other sites have vast information which might enable them to further personalise a user s internet experience if they chose to do so one account suggested that google can keep track of user past histories even if they don t have a personal google account or are not logged in to one 4 one report was that google has collected 10 years worth of information amassed from varying sources such as gmail maps and other services besides its search engine 3 although a contrary report was that trying to personalise the internet for each user was technically challenging for an internet firm to achieve despite the huge amounts of available web data analyst doug gross of cnn suggested that filtered searching seemed to be more helpful for consumers than for citizens and would help a consumer looking for pizza find local delivery options based on a personalised search and appropriately filter out distant pizza stores 3 there is agreement that sites within the internet such as the washington post the new york times and others are pushing efforts towards creating personalised information engines with the principle being tailoring search results to ones which users are likely to like or agree with 2 edit related concepts main article relevance paradox the filter bubble concept is similar to a phenomenon in which people and organisations seek information which is initially perceived as relevant but which turns out to be useless or on in fact only partially useful and avoid information perceived as irrelevant but which turns out to be useful the problem happens because the real relevance of a particular fact or concept in these cases is apparent only after that fact has become known before that the idea of learning a particular fact may have been dismissed because of a misperception of irrelevance accordingly the information seeker is trapped in a paradox and fails to learn what he or she really needs to know and can be caught in a kind of intellectual blind spot this phenomenon has been described as the relevance paradox 8 and it has happened in many situations throughout human intellectual development and is an important issue for science and education a book entitled the irg solution predicted and analysed this problem and suggested a generalised solution edit further reading pariser eli the filter bubble what the internet is hiding from you penguin press new york may
