a screenshot of a web page on wikipedia a web page or webpage is a document or information resource that is suitable for the world wide web and can be accessed through a web browser and displayed on a monitor or mobile device this information is usually in html or xhtml format and may provide navigation to other web pages via hypertext links web pages frequently subsume other resources such as style sheets scripts and images into their final presentation web pages may be retrieved from a local computer or from a remote web server the web server may restrict access only to a private network e g a corporate intranet or it may publish pages on the world wide web web pages are requested and served from web servers using hypertext transfer protocol http web pages may consist of files of static text and other content stored within the web server s file system static web pages or may be constructed by server side software when they are requested dynamic web pages client side scripting

also contain links to images and sometimes other types of media to be included in the final view layout typographic and color scheme information is provided by cascading style sheet css instructions which can either be embedded in the html or can be provided by a separate file which is referenced from within the html the latter case is especially relevant where one lengthy stylesheet is relevant to a whole website due to the way http works the browser will only download it once from the web server and use the cached copy for the whole site images are stored on the web server as separate files but again http allows for the fact that once a web page is downloaded to a browser it is quite likely that related files such as images and stylesheets will be requested as it is processed an http 1 1 web server will maintain a connection with the browser until all related resources have been requested and provided web browsers usually render images along with the text and other material on the displayed web page edit dynamic behavior main article dynamic web page client side computer code such as javascript or code implementing ajax techniques can be provided either embedded in the html of

apply their own css styling to the page the world wide web consortium w3c and web accessibility initiative wai recommend that all web pages should be designed with all of these options in mind edit elements a web page as an information set can contain numerous types of information which is able to be seen heard or interact by the end user perceived rendered information textual information with diverse render variations non textual information static images may be raster graphics typically gif jpeg or png or vector formats such as svg or flash animated images typically animated gif and svg but also may be flash shockwave or java applet audio typically mp3 ogg or various proprietary formats video wmv windows rm realmedia flv flash video mpg mov quicktime interactive information see

information document type definition dtd etc diagramation and style information information about rendered items like image size attributes and visual specifications as cascading style sheets css scripts usually javascript complement interactivity and functionality note on server side the web page may also have processing instruction information items the web page can also contain dynamically adapted information elements dependent upon the rendering browser or end user location through the use of ip address tracking and or cookie information from a more general wide point of view some information grouped elements like a navigation bar are uniform for all website pages like a standard these kind of website standard information are supplied by technologies like web template systems edit rendering web pages will often require more screen space than is available for a particular display resolution most modern browsers will place a scrollbar a sliding tool at the side of the screen that allows the user to move the page up or down or side to side in the window to allow the user to see all content scrolling horizontally is less prevalent than vertical scrolling not only because such pages often do not print properly but because it inconveniences the user more so than vertical scrolling would because lines are horizontal scrolling back and forth for every line is much more inconvenient than scrolling after reading a whole screen also most computer keyboards have page up and down keys and many computer mice have vertical scroll wheels but the horizontal scrolling equivalents are rare when web pages are stored in a common directory of a web server they become a website a website will typically contain a group of web pages that are linked together or have some other coherent method of navigation the most important web page to have on a website is the index page depending on the web server settings this index page can have many different names but the most common is index html when a browser visits the homepage for a website or any url pointing to a directory rather than a specific file the web server will serve the index page to the requesting browser if no index page is defined in the configuration or no such file exists on the server either an error or directory listing will be served to the browser a web page can either be a single html file or

page navigation or page headers to be repeated without duplicating the html in many files frames and the w3c recommended alternative of 2000 the lt object gt tag 1 also allow some content to remain in one place while other content can be scrolled using conventional scrollbars modern css and javascript client side techniques can also achieve all of these goals and more when creating a web page it is important to ensure it conforms to the world wide web consortium w3c standards for html css xml and other standards the w3c standards are in place to ensure all browsers which conform to their standards can display identical content without any special consideration for proprietary rendering techniques a properly coded web page is going to be accessible to many different browsers old and new alike display resolutions as well as those users with audio or visual impairments edit url main article uniform resource locator typically web pages today are becoming more dynamic a dynamic web page is one that is created server side when it is requested and then served to the end user these types of web pages typically do not have a permalink or a static url associated with them today this can be seen in many popular forums online shopping and even on wikipedia this practice is intended to reduce the amount of static pages in lieu of storing the relevant web page information in a database some search engines may have a hard time indexing a web page that is dynamic so static web pages can be provided in those instances edit viewing in order to graphically display a web page a web browser is needed this is a type of software that can retrieve web pages from the internet most current web browsers include the ability to view the source code viewing a web page in a text editor will also display the source code edit creation to create a web page a text editor or a specialized html editor is needed in order to upload the created web page to a web server traditionally an ftp client is needed the design of a web page is highly personal a design can be made according to one s own preference or a premade web template can be used web templates let web page designers edit the content of a web page without having to worry about the overall aesthetics many people publish their own web pages using products like tripod or angelfire these web publishing tools offer free page creation and hosting up to a certain size limit other ways of making a web page is to download specialized software like a wiki cms or forum these options allow for quick and easy creation of a web page which is typically dynamic edit saving while one is viewing a web page a copy of it is saved locally this is what is being viewed depending on the browser settings this copy may be deleted at any time or stored indefinitely sometimes without the user realizing it most gui browsers provide options for saving a web page more permanently these may include save the rendered text without formatting or images with hyperlinks reduced to plain text save the html as it was served 160 overall structure preserved but some links may be broken save the html with relative links changed to absolute ones so that hyperlinks are preserved save the entire web page 160 all images and other resources including stylesheets and scripts are downloaded and saved in a new folder alongside the html with links to them altered to refer to the local copies other relative links changed to absolute save the html as well as all images and other resources into a single mhtml file this is supported by internet

suitable plugin has been installed most operating systems allow applications such as web browsers not only to print the currently viewed web page to a printer but optionally to print to a file that can be viewed or printed later some web pages are designed for example by use of css so that hyperlinks menus and other navigation items which will be useless on paper are rendered into print with this in mind sometimes the destination addresses of hyperlinks may be shown explicitly either within the body of the page or listed at the end of the printed version web page designers may specify in css that non functional menus navigational blocks and other items may simply be absent from the printed version edit see also dead link domain name guestbook homepage linked data page seo copywriting
