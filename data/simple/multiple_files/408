branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers e g rational numbers or defined

understood through the study of analytical objects e g the riemann zeta function that encode properties of the integers primes or other number theoretic objects in some fashion analytic number theory one may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers e g as approximated by the latter diophantine approximation the older term for number theory is arithmetic by the early twentieth century it had been superseded by number theory note 2 the word arithmetic is used by the general public to mean elementary calculations it has also acquired other meanings in mathematical logic as in peano arithmetic and computer science as in floating point arithmetic the use of the term arithmetic for number theory regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century arguably in part due to french influence note 3 in particular arithmetical is preferred as an adjective to number theoretic contents 1 history 1 1 origins 1 1 1 dawn of arithmetic 1 1 2 classical greece and the early

edit history edit origins edit dawn of arithmetic the first historical find of an arithmetical nature is a fragment of a table the broken clay tablet plimpton 322 larsa mesopotamia ca 1800 bce contains a list of pythagorean triples i e integers such that the triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by brute force the heading over the first column reads the takiltum of the diagonal which has been substracted such that the width 1 the plimpton 322 tablet the table s layout suggests 2 that it was constructed by means of what amounts in modern language to the identity which is implicit in routine old babylonian exercises 3 if some other method was used 4 the triples were first constructed and then reordered by presumably for actual use as a table i e with a view to applications we do not know what these applications may have been or whether there could have been any babylonian astronomy for example truly flowered only later it has been suggested instead that the table was a source of numerical examples for school problems 5 note 4 while babylonian number theory or what survives of babylonian mathematics that can be called thus consists of this single striking fragment babylonian algebra in the secondary school sense of algebra was exceptionally well developed 6 late neoplatonic sources 7 state that pythagoras learned mathematics from the babylonians much earlier sources 8 state that thales and pythagoras traveled and studied in egypt euclid ix 21 34 is very probably pythagorean 9 it is very simple material odd times even is even if an odd number measures divides an even number then it also measures divides half of it but it is all that is needed to prove that is irrational 10 pythagorean mystics gave great importance to the odd and the even 11 the discovery that is irrational is credited to the early pythagoreans pre theodorus 12 by revealing in modern terms that numbers could be irrational this discovery seems to have provoked the first foundational crisis in mathematical history its proof or its divulgation are sometimes credited to hippasus who was expelled or split from the pythagorean sect 13 it is only here that we can start to speak of a clear conscious division between numbers integers and the rationals the subjects of arithmetic and lengths real numbers whether rational or not the pythagorean tradition spoke also of so called polygonal or figurate numbers 14 while square numbers cubic numbers etc are seen now as more natural than triangular numbers square numbers pentagonal numbers etc the study of the sums of triangular and pentagonal numbers would prove fruitful in the early modern period 17th to early 19th century we know of no clearly arithmetical material in ancient egyptian or vedic sources though there is some algebra in both the chinese remainder theorem appears as an exercise 15 in sun zi s suan ching also known as the mathematical classic of sun zi 3rd 4th or 5th century ce 16 there is one important step glossed over in sun zi s solution note 5 it is the problem that was later solved by ryabha a s ku aka see below there is also some numerical mysticism in chinese mathematics note 6 but unlike that of the pythagoreans it seems to have led nowhere like the pythagoreans perfect numbers magic squares have passed from superstition into recreation edit classical greece and the early hellenistic period aside from a few fragments the mathematics of classical greece is known to us either through the reports of contemporary non mathematicians or through mathematical works from the early hellenistic period 17 in the case of number theory this means by and large plato and euclid respectively plato had a keen interest in mathematics and distinguished clearly between arithmetic and calculation by arithmetic he meant in part theorising on number rather than what arithmetic or number theory have come to mean it is through one of plato s dialogues namely theaetetus that we know that theodorus had proven that are irrational theaetetus was like plato a disciple of theodorus s he worked on distinguishing different kinds of incommensurables and was thus arguably a pioneer in the study of number systems book x of euclid s elements is described by pappus as being largely based on theaetetus s work euclid devoted part of his elements to prime numbers and divisibility topics that belong unambiguously to number theory and are basic thereto books vii to ix of euclid s elements in particular he gave an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers the euclidean algorithm elements prop vii 2 and the first known proof of the infinitude of primes elements prop ix 20 in 1773 lessing published an epigram he had found in a manuscript during his work as a librarian it claimed to be a letter sent by archimedes to eratosthenes 18 19 the epigram proposed what has become known as archimedes cattle problem its solution absent from the manuscript requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation which reduces to what would later be misnamed pell s equation as far as we know such equations were first successfully treated by the indian school it is not known whether archimedes himself had a method of solution edit diophantus title page of the 1621 edition of diophantus arithmetica translated into latin by claude gaspard bachet de m ziriac very little is known about diophantus of alexandria he probably lived in the third century ce that is about five hundred years after euclid six out of the thirteen books of diophantus s arithmetica survive in the original greek four more books survive in an arabic translation the arithmetica is a collection of worked out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations usually of the form or thus nowadays we speak of diophantine equations when we speak of polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions must be found one may say that diophantus was studying rational points i e points whose coordinates are rational on curves and algebraic varieties however unlike the greeks of the classical period who did what we would now call basic algebra in geometrical terms diophantus did what we would now call basic algebraic geometry in purely algebraic terms in modern language what diophantus did was to find rational parametrizations of varieties that is given an equation of the form say his aim was to find in essence three rational functions such that for all values of and setting for gives a solution to diophantus also studied the equations of some non rational curves for which no rational parametrisation is possible he managed to find some rational points on these curves elliptic curves as it happens in what seems to be their first known occurrence by means of what amounts to a tangent construction translated into coordinate geometry which did not exist in diophantus s time his method would be visualised as drawing a tangent to a curve at a known rational point and then finding the other point of intersection of the tangent with the curve that other point is a new rational point diophantus also resorted to what could be called a special case of a secant construction while diophantus was concerned largely with rational solutions he assumed some results on integer numbers in particular that every integer is the sum of four squares though he never stated as much explicitly edit indian school ryabha a brahmagupta bh skara while greek astronomy thanks to alexander s conquests probably influenced indian learning to the point of introducing trigonometry 20 it seems to be the case that indian mathematics is otherwise an indigenous tradition 21 in particular there is no evidence that euclid s elements reached india before the 18th century 22 ryabha a 476 550 ce showed that pairs of simultaneous congruences could be solved by a method he called ku aka or pulveriser 23 this is a procedure close to a generalisation of the euclidean algorithm which was probably discovered independently in india 24 ryabha a seems to have had in mind applications to astronomical calculations 25 brahmagupta 628 ce started the systematic study of indefinite quadratic equations in particular the misnamed pell equation in which archimedes may have first been interested and which did not start to be solved in the west until the time of fermat and euler later sanskrit authors would follow using brahmagupta s technical terminology a general procedure the chakravala or cyclic method for solving pell s equation was finally found by jayadeva cited in the eleventh century his work is otherwise lost the earliest surviving exposition appears in bh skara ii s b ja ga ita twelfth century 26 unfortunately indian mathematics remained largely unknown in the west until the late eighteenth century 27 brahmagupta and bh skara s work was translated into english in 1817 by henry colebrooke 28 edit arithmetic in the islamic golden age al haytham seen by the west frontispice of selenographia showing alhasen sic representing knowledge through reason and galileo representing knowledge through the senses in the early ninth century the caliph al ma mun ordered translations of many greek mathematical works and at least one sanskrit work the sindhind which may 29 or may not 30 be brahmagupta s br hmasphu asiddh nta thus giving rise to the tradition of islamic mathematics diophantus s main work the arithmetica was translated into arabic by qusta ibn luqa 820 912 part of the treatise al fakhri by al karaj 953 ca 1029 builds on it to some extent according to rashed roshdi al karaj s contemporary ibn al haytham knew 31 what would later be called wilson s theorem other than a treatise on squares in arithmetic progression by fibonacci who lived and studied in north africa and constantinople during his formative years ca 1175 1200 no number theory to speak of was done in western europe during the middle ages matters started to change in europe in the late renaissance thanks to a renewed study of the works of greek antiquity a catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into latin of diophantus s arithmetica bachet 1621 following a first attempt by xylander 1575 edit early modern number theory edit fermat pierre de fermat pierre de fermat 1601 1665 never published his writings in particular his work on number theory is contained almost entirely in letters to mathematicians and in private marginal notes 32 he wrote down nearly no proofs in number theory he had no models in the area 33 he did make repeated use of mathematical induction introducing the method of infinite descent one of fermat s first interests was perfect numbers which appear in euclid elements ix and amicable numbers note 7 this led him to work on integer divisors which were from the beginning among the subjects of the correspondence 1636 onwards that put him in touch with the mathematical community of the day 34 he had already studied bachet s edition of diophantus carefully 35 by 1643 his interests had shifted largely to diophantine problems and sums of squares 36 also treated by diophantus fermat s achievements in arithmetic include fermat s little theorem 1640 37 stating that if a is not divisible by a prime p then note 8 if a and b are coprime then is not divisible by any prime congruent to 1 modulo 4 38 and every prime congruent to 1 modulo 4 can be written in the form 39 these two statements also date from 1640 in 1659 fermat stated to huygens that he had proven the latter statement by the method of descent 40 fermat and frenicle also did some work some of it erroneous or non rigorous 41 on other quadratic forms fermat posed the problem of solving as a challenge to english mathematicians 1657 the problem was solved in a few months by wallis and brouncker 42 fermat considered their solution valid but pointed out they had provided an algorithm without a proof as had jayadeva and bhaskara though fermat would never know this he states that a proof can be found by descent fermat developed methods for doing what in our terms amounts to finding points on curves of genus 0 and 1 as in diophantus there are many special procedures and what amounts to a tangent construction but no use of a secant construction 43 fermat states and proves by descent in the appendix to observations on diophantus obs xlv 44 that has no non trivial solutions in the integers fermat also mentioned to his correspondents that has no non trivial solutions and that this could be proven by descent 45 the first known proof is due to euler 1753 indeed by descent 46 fermat s claim fermat s last theorem to have shown there are no solutions to for all a fact completely beyond his methods appears only in his annotations on the margin of his copy of diophantus he never claimed this to others 47 and thus would have had no need to retract it if he found any mistake in his supposed proof edit euler leonhard euler the interest of leonhard euler 1707 1783 in number theory was first spurred in 1729 when a friend of his the amateur note 9 goldbach pointed him towards some of fermat s work on the subject 48 49 this has been called the rebirth of modern number theory 35 after fermat s relative lack of success in getting his contemporaries attention for the subject 50 euler s work on number theory includes the following 51 proofs for fermat s statements this includes fermat s little theorem generalised by euler to non prime moduli the fact that if and only if initial work towards a proof that every integer is the sum of four squares the first complete proof is by lagrange 1770 soon improved by euler himself 52 the lack of non zero integer solutions to implying the case n 4 of fermat s last theorem the case n 3 of which euler also proved by a related method pell s equation first misnamed by euler 53 he wrote on the link between continued fractions and pell s equation 54 first steps towards analytic number theory in his work of sums of four squares partitions pentagonal numbers and the distribution of prime numbers euler pioneered the use of what can be seen as analysis in particular infinite series in number theory since he lived before the development of complex analysis most of his work is restricted to the formal manipulation of power series he did however do some very notable though not fully rigorous early work on what would later be called the riemann zeta function 55 quadratic forms following fermat s lead euler did further research on the question of which primes can be expressed in the form some of it prefiguring quadratic reciprocity 56 57 58 diophantine equations euler worked on some diophantine equations of genus 0 and 1 59 60 in particular he studied diophantus s work he tried to systematise it but the time was not yet ripe for such an endeavour algebraic geometry was still in its infancy 61 he did notice there was a connection between diophantine problems and elliptic integrals 61 whose study he had himself initiated edit lagrange legendre and gauss carl friedrich gauss s disquisitiones arithmeticae first edition lagrange 1736 1813 was the first to give full proofs of some of fermat s and euler s work and observations for instance the four square theorem and the basic theory of the misnamed pell s equation for which an algorithmic solution was found by fermat and his contemporaries and also by jayadeva and bhaskara ii before them he also studied quadratic forms in full generality as opposed to defining their equivalence relation showing how to put them in reduced form etc legendre 1752 1833 was the first to state the law of quadratic reciprocity he also conjectured what amounts to the prime number theorem and dirichlet s theorem on arithmetic progressions he gave a full treatment of the equation 62 and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by gauss 63 in his old age he was the first to prove fermat s last theorem for completing work by dirichlet and crediting both him and sophie germain 64 carl friedrich gauss in his disquisitiones arithmeticae 1798 gauss 1777 1855 proved the law of quadratic reciprocity and developed the theory of quadratic forms in particular defining their composition he also introduced some basic notation congruences and devoted a section to computational matters including primality tests 65 the last section of the disquisitiones established a link between roots of unity and number theory the theory of the division of the circle which is treated in sec 7 does not belong by itself to arithmetic but its principles can only be drawn from higher arithmetic 66 in this way gauss arguably made a first foray towards both galois s work and algebraic number theory edit maturity and division into subfields ernst kummer peter gustav lejeune dirichlet starting early in the nineteenth century the following developments gradually took place the rise to self consciousness of number theory or higher arithmetic as a field of study 67 the development of much of modern mathematics necessary for basic modern number theory complex analysis group theory galois theory accompanied by greater rigor in analysis and abstraction in algebra the rough subdivision of number theory into its modern subfields in particular analytic and algebraic number theory algebraic number theory may be said to start with the study of reciprocity and cyclotomy but truly came into its own with the development of abstract algebra and early ideal theory and valuation theory see below a conventional starting point for analytic number theory is dirichlet s theorem on arithmetic progressions 1837 68 69 whose proof introduced l functions and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable 70 the first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually goes back to euler 1730s 71 72 who used formal power series and non rigorous or implicit limiting arguments the use of complex analysis in number theory comes later the work of riemann 1859 on the zeta function is the canonical starting point 73 jacobi s four square theorem 1839 which predates it belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory modular forms 74 the history of each subfield is briefly addressed in its own section below see the main article of each subfield for fuller treatments many of the most interesting questions in each area remain open and are being actively worked on edit main subdivisions edit elementary tools the term elementary generally denotes a method that does not use complex analysis for example the prime number theorem was first proven in 1896 but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by erd s and selberg 75 the term is somewhat ambiguous for example proofs based on complex tauberian theorems e g wiener ikehara are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary in spite of using fourier analysis rather than complex analysis as such here as elsewhere an elementary proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non elementary one number theory has the reputation of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson at the same time the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible in part because the range of tools they use is if anything unusually broad within mathematics 76 edit analytic number theory main article analytic number theory riemann zeta function s in the complex plane the color of a point s gives the value of s dark colors denote values close to zero and hue gives the value s argument the action of the modular group on the upper half plane the region in grey is the standard fundamental domain analytic number theory may be defined in terms of its tools as the study of the integers by means of tools from real and complex analysis 68 or in terms of its concerns as the study within number theory of estimates on size and density as opposed to identities 77 some subjects generally considered to be part of analytic number theory e g sieve theory note 10 are better covered by the second rather than the first definition some of sieve theory for instance uses little analysis note 11 yet it is considered to be part of analytic number theory the following are examples of problems in analytic number theory the prime number theorem the goldbach conjecture or the twin prime conjecture or the hardy littlewood conjectures the waring problem and the riemann hypothesis some of the most important tools of analytic number theory are the circle method sieve methods and l functions or rather the study of their properties the theory of modular forms and more generally automorphic forms also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory one may ask analytic questions about algebraic numbers and use analytic means to answer such questions it is thus that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect for example one may define prime ideals generalizations of prime numbers living in the field of algebraic numbers and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size this question can be answered by means of an examination of dedekind zeta functions which are generalizations of the riemann zeta function an all important analytic object that describes the distribution of prime numbers edit algebraic number theory main article algebraic number theory algebraic number theory studies algebraic properties and algebraic objects of interest in number theory thus analytic and algebraic number theory can and do overlap the former is defined by its methods the latter by its objects of study a key topic is that of the algebraic numbers which are generalizations of the rational numbers briefly an algebraic number is any complex number that is a solution to some polynomial equation with rational coefficients for example every solution of say is an algebraic number fields of algebraic numbers are also called algebraic number fields or shortly number fields it could be argued that the simplest kind of number fields viz quadratic fields were already studied by gauss as the discussion of quadratic forms in disquisitiones arithmeticae can be restated in terms of ideals and norms in quadratic fields a quadratic field consists of all numbers of the form where and are rational numbers and is a fixed rational number whose square root is not rational for that matter the 11th century chakravala method amounts in modern terms to an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field however neither bh skara nor gauss knew of number fields as such the grounds of the subject as we know it were set in the late nineteenth century when ideal numbers the theory of ideals and valuation theory were developed these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorisation in algebraic number fields for example in the field generated by the rationals and the number can be factorised both as and all of and are irreducible and thus in a na ve sense analogous to primes among the integers the initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers by kummer seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws 78 i e generalisations of quadratic reciprocity number fields are often studied as extensions of smaller number fields a field l is said to be an extension of a field k if l contains k for example the complex numbers c are an extension of the reals r and the reals r are an extension of the rationals q classifying the possible extensions of a given number field is a difficult and partially open problem abelian extensions that is extensions l of k such that the galois group note 12 gal l k of l over k is an abelian group are relatively well understood their classification was the object of the programme of class field theory which was initiated in the late 19th century partly by kronecker and eisenstein and carried out largely in 1900 1950 an example of an active area of research in algebraic number theory is iwasawa theory the langlands program one of the main current large scale research plans in mathematics is sometimes described as an attempt to generalise class field theory to non abelian extensions of number fields edit diophantine geometry main articles diophantine geometry and glossary of arithmetic and diophantine geometry the central problem of diophantine geometry is to determine when a diophantine equation has solutions and if it does how many the approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object for example an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane more generally an equation or system of equations in two or more variables defines a curve a surface or some other such object in n dimensional space in diophantine geometry one asks whether there are any rational points points all of whose coordinates are rationals or integral points points all of whose coordinates are integers on the curve or surface if there are any such points the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed a basic question in this direction is are there finitely or infinitely many rational points on a given curve or surface what about integer points an example here may be helpful consider the pythagorean equation we would like to study its rational solutions i e its solutions such that x and y are both rational this is the same as asking for all integer solutions to any solution to the latter equation gives us a solution to the former it is also the same as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve described by this curve happens to be a circle of radius 1 around the origin two examples of an elliptic curve i e a curve of genus 1 having at least one rational point either graph can be seen as a slice of a torus in four dimensional space the rephrasing of questions on equations in terms of points on curves turns out to be felicitous the finiteness or not of the number of rational or integer points on an algebraic curve that is rational or integer solutions to an equation where is a polynomial in two variables turns out to depend crucially on the genus of the curve the genus can be defined as follows note 13 allow the variables in to be complex numbers then defines a 2 dimensional surface in projective 4 dimensional space since two complex variables can be decomposed into four real variables i e four dimensions count the number of doughnut holes in the surface call this number the genus of other geometrical notions turn out to be just as crucial there is also the closely linked area of diophantine approximations given a number how well can it be approximated by rationals we are looking for approximations that are good relative to the amount of space that it takes to write the rational call with a good approximation to if where is large this question is of special interest if is an algebraic number if cannot be well approximated then some equations do not have integer or rational solutions moreover several concepts especially that of height turn out to be crucial both in diophantine geometry and in the study of diophantine approximations this question is also of special interest in transcendence theory if a number can be better approximated than any algebraic number then it is a transcendental number it is by this argument that and e have been shown to be transcendental diophantine geometry should not be confused with the geometry of numbers which is a collection of graphical methods for answering certain questions in algebraic number theory arithmetic geometry on the other hand is a contemporary term for much the same domain as that covered by the term diophantine geometry the term arithmetic geometry is arguably used most often when one wishes to emphasise the connections to modern algebraic geometry as in for instance faltings theorem rather than to techniques in diophantine approximations edit recent approaches and subfields the areas below date as such from no earlier than the mid twentieth century even if they are based on older material for example as is explained below the matter of algorithms in number theory is very old in some sense older than the concept of proof at the same time the modern study of computability dates only from the 1930s and 1940s and computational complexity theory from the 1970s edit probabilistic number theory main article probabilistic number theory take a number at random between one and a million how likely is it to be prime this is just another way of asking how many primes there are between one and a million very well ask further how many prime divisors will it have on average how many divisors will it have altogether and with what likelihood what is the probability that it have many more or many fewer divisors or prime divisors than the average much of probabilistic number theory can be seen as an important special case of the study of variables that are almost but not quite mutually independent for example the event that a random integer between one and a million be divisible by two and the event that it be divisible by three are almost independent but not quite it is sometimes said that probabilistic combinatorics uses the fact that whatever happens with probability greater than must happen sometimes one may say with equal justice that many applications of probabilistic number theory hinge on the fact that whatever is unusual must be rare if certain algebraic objects say rational or integer solutions to certain equations can be shown to be in the tail of certain sensibly defined distributions it follows that there must be few of them this is a very concrete non probabilistic statement following from a probabilistic one at times non rigorous probabilistic approach leads to a number of heuristic algorithms and open problems notably cram r s conjecture edit arithmetic combinatorics main articles arithmetic combinatorics and additive number theory let a be a set of n integers consider the set a a m n m n a consisting of all sums of two elements of a is a a much larger than a barely larger if a a is barely larger than a must a have plenty of arithmetic structure for example does a resemble an arithmetic progression if we begin from a fairly thick infinite set does it contain many elements in arithmetic progression say should it be possible to write large integers as sums of elements of these questions are characteristic of arithmetic combinatorics this is a presently coalescing field it subsumes additive number theory which concerns itself with certain very specific sets of arithmetic significance such as the primes or the squares and arguably some of the geometry of numbers together with some rapidly developing new material its focus on issues of growth and distribution accounts in part for its developing links with ergodic theory finite group theory model theory and other fields the term additive combinatorics is also used however the sets being studied need not be sets of integers but rather subsets of non commutative groups for which the multiplication symbol not the addition symbol is traditionally used they can also be subsets of rings in which case the growth of and may be compared edit computations in number theory main article computational number theory while the word algorithm goes back only to certain readers of al khw rizm careful descriptions of methods of solution are older than proofs such methods that is algorithms are as old as any recognisable mathematics ancient egyptian babylonian vedic chinese whereas proofs appeared only with the greeks of the classical period an interesting early case is that of what we now call the euclidean algorithm in its basic form namely as an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor it appears as proposition 2 of book vii in elements together with a proof of correctness however in the form that is often used in number theory namely as an algorithm for finding integer solutions to an equation or what is the same for finding the quantities whose existence is assured by the chinese remainder theorem it first appears in the works of ryabha a 5th 6th century ce as an algorithm called ku aka pulveriser without a proof of correctness there are two main questions can we compute this and can we compute it rapidly anybody can test whether a number is prime or if it is not split it into prime factors doing so rapidly is another matter we now know fast algorithms for testing primality but in spite of much work both theoretical and practical no truly fast algorithm for factoring the difficulty of a computation can be useful modern protocols for encrypting messages e g rsa depend on functions that are known to all but whose inverses a are known only to a chosen few and b would take one too long a time to figure out on one s own for example these functions can be such that their inverses can be computed only if certain large integers are factorized while many difficult computational problems outside number theory are known most working encryption protocols nowadays are based on the difficulty of a few number theoretical problems on a different note some things may not be computable at all in fact this can be proven in some instances for instance in 1970 it was proven that there is no turing machine which can solve all diophantine equations see hilbert s 10th problem there are thus some problems in number theory that will never be solved we even know the shape of some of them viz diophantine equations in nine variables we simply do not know and cannot know which coefficients give us equations for which the following two statements are both true there are no solutions and we shall never know that there are no solutions edit applications the number theorist leonard dickson 1874 1954 said thank god that number theory is unsullied by any application such a view is no longer applicable to number theory 79 in 1974 donald knuth said virtually every theorem in elementary number theory arises in a natural motivated way in connection with the problem of making computers do high speed numerical calculations 80 elementary number theory is taught in discrete mathematics courses for computer scientists and on the other hand number theory also has applications to the continuous in numerical analysis 81 as well as the well known applications to cryptography there are also applications to many other areas of mathematics 82 83 edit literature two of the most popular introductions to the

the book hardy amp wright 2008 robson 2001 p 160 201 this is controversial see plimpton 322 robson s article is written polemically robson 2001 p 160 202 with a view to perhaps knocking plimpton 322 off its pedestal robson 2001 p 160 167 at the same time it settles to the conclusion that the question how was the tablet calculated does not have to have the same answer as the question what problems does the tablet set the first can be answered most satisfactorily by reciprocal pairs as first suggested half a century ago and the second by some sort of right triangle problems robson 2001 p 160 202 robson takes issue with the notion that the scribe who produced plimpton 322 who had to work for a living and would not have belonged to a leisured middle class could have been motivated by his own idle curiosity in the absence of a market for new mathematics robson 2001 pp 160 199 200 sun zi suan ching ch 3 problem 26 in lam amp ang 2004 pp 160 219 220 26 now there are an unknown number of

the remainder is odd the sex is male and if the remainder is even the sex is female this is the last problem in sun zi s otherwise matter of fact treatise perfect and especially amicable numbers are of little or no interest nowadays the same was not true in medieval times whether in the west or the arab speaking world due in part to the importance given to them by the neopythagorean and hence mystical nicomachus ca 100 ce who wrote a primitive but influential introduction to arithmetic see van der waerden 1961 ch iv here as usual given two integers a and b and a non zero integer m we write read a is congruent to b modulo m to mean that m divides a 160 160 b or what is the same a and b leave the same residue when divided by m this notation is actually much later than fermat s it first appears in section 1 of gauss s disquisitiones arithmeticae fermat s little theorem is a consequence of the fact that the order of an element of a group divides the order of the group the modern proof would have been within fermat s means and was indeed given later by euler even though the modern concept of a group came long after fermat or euler it helps to know that inverses exist modulo p i e given a not divisible by a prime p there is an integer x such that this fact which in modern language makes the residues mod p into a group and which was already known to ryabha a see above was familiar to fermat thanks to its rediscovery by bachet weil 1984 p 160 7 weil goes on to say that fermat would have recognised that bachet s argument is essentially euclid s algorithm up to the second half of the seventeenth century academic positions were very rare and most mathematicians and scientists earned their living in some other way weil 1984 pp 160 159 161 there were already some recognisable features of professional practice viz seeking correspondents visiting foreign colleagues building private libraries weil 1984 pp 160 160 161 matters started to shift in the late 17th century weil 1984 p 160 161 scientific academies were founded in england the royal society 1662 and france the acad mie des sciences 1666 and russia 1724 euler was offered a position at this last one in 1726 he accepted arriving in st petersburg in 1727 weil 1984 p 160 163 and varadarajan 2006 p 160 7 in this context the term amateur usually applied to goldbach is well defined and makes some sense he has been described as a man of letters who earned a living as a spy truesdell 1984 p 160 xv cited in varadarajan 2006 p 160 9 notice however that goldbach published some works on mathematics and sometimes held academic positions sieve theory figures as one of the main subareas of analytic number theory in many standard treatments see for instance iwaniec amp kowalski 2004 or montgomery amp vaughan 2007 this is the case for small sieves in particular some combinatorial sieves such as the brun sieve rather than for large sieves the study of the latter now includes ideas from harmonic and functional analysis the galois group of an extension k l consists of the operations isomorphisms that send elements of l to other elements of l while leaving all elements of k fixed thus for instance gal c r consists of two elements the identity element taking every element x 160 160 iy of c to itself and complex conjugation the map taking each element x 160 160 iy to x 160 160 iy the galois group of an extension tells us many of its crucial properties the study of galois groups started with variste galois in modern language the main outcome of his work is that an equation f x 160 160 0 can be solved by radicals that is x can be expressed in terms of the four basic operations together with square roots cubic roots etc if and only if the extension of the rationals by the roots of the equation f x 160 160 0 has a galois group that is solvable in the sense of group theory solvable in the sense of group theory is a simple property that can be checked easily for finite groups it may be useful to look at an example here say we want to study the curve we allow x and y to be complex numbers this is in effect a set of two equations on four variables since both the real and the imaginary part on each side must match as a result we get a surface two dimensional in four dimensional space after we choose a convenient hyperplane on which to project the surface meaning that say we choose to ignore the coordinate a we can plot the resulting projection which is a surface in ordinary three dimensional space it then becomes clear that the result is a torus i e the surface of a doughnut somewhat stretched a doughnut has one hole hence the genus is 1 edit references neugebauer amp sachs 1945 p 160 40 the term takiltum is problematic robson prefers the rendering the holding square of the diagonal from which 1 is torn out so that the short side comes up robson 2001 p 160 192 robson 2001 p 160 189 other sources give the modern formula van der waerden gives both the modern formula and what amounts to the form preferred by robson van der waerden 1961 p 160 79 van der waerden 1961 p 160 184 neugebauer neugebauer 1969 pp 160 36 40 discusses the table in detail and mentions
