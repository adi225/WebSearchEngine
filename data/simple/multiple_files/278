information systems informatics studies the structure algorithms behavior and interactions of natural and artificial systems that store process access and communicate information in addition it studies human computer interaction and how an interface can be built to maximize user efficiency it also develops its own conceptual and theoretical foundations and utilizes foundations developed in other fields since the advent of computers individuals and organizations increasingly process information digitally this has led to the study of informatics that has computational biological cognitive and social aspects including study of the social impact of information technologies loosely it can be thought of as studying how to design a system that delivers the right information to the right person in the right place and time in the right way and is intimately tied to workflow discussions and standards contents 1 etymology 2 history 3 contributing disciplines 4 see also 5 notes 6 external links edit etymology in 1957 the german computer scientist karl steinbuch coined the word informatik by publishing a paper called informatik automatische informationsverarbeitung informatics automatic information processing 1 the english term informatics is sometimes understood as meaning the same as computer science however the german word informatik is the correct translation of english computer science clarification needed the french term informatique was coined in 1962 by philippe dreyfus 2 together with various translations informatics english also proposed independently and simultaneously by walter f bauer and associates who co founded informatics inc and informatica italian spanish romanian portuguese dutch referring to the application of computers to store and process information the term was coined as a combination of information and automatic to describe the science of automating information interactions the morphology informat ion ics uses the accepted form for names of sciences as conics linguistics optics or matters of practice as economics politics tactics 3 and so linguistically the meaning extends easily to encompass both the science of information and the practice of information processing the naming for computer science is derived from the concept of computation which doesn t necessarily involve the existence of information for example quantum computation and digital logic does not involve information a practitioner of informatics may be called an informatician or an informaticist edit history this new term was adopted across western europe and except in english developed a meaning roughly translated by the english computer science or computing science mikhailov et al advocated the russian term informatika 1966 and the english informatics 1967 as names for the theory of scientific information and argued for a broader meaning including study of the use of information technology in various communities for example scientific and of the interaction of technology and human organizational structures informatics is the discipline of science which investigates the structure and properties not specific content of scientific information as well as the regularities of scientific information activity its theory history methodology and organization 4 usage has since modified this definition in three ways first the restriction to scientific information is removed as in business informatics or legal informatics second since most information is now digitally stored computation is now central to informatics third the representation processing and communication of information are added as objects of investigation since they have been recognized as fundamental to any scientific account of information taking information as the central focus of study distinguishes informatics from computer science informatics includes the study of biological and social mechanisms of information processing whereas computer science focuses on the digital computation similarly in the study of representation and communication informatics is indifferent to the substrate that carries information for example it encompasses the study of communication using gesture speech and language as well as digital communications and networking in the english speaking world the term informatics was first widely used in the compound medical informatics taken to include the cognitive information processing and communication tasks of medical practice education and research including information science and the technology to support these tasks 5 many such compounds are now in use they can be viewed as different areas of applied informatics informatics encompasses the study of systems that represent process and communicate information however the theory of computation in the specific discipline of theoretical computer science which evolved from alan turing studies the notion of a complex system regardless of whether or not information actually exists since both fields process information there is some disagreement among scientists as to field hierarchy for example arizona state university attempted to adopt a broader definition of informatics to even encompass cognitive science at the launch of its school of computing and informatics in september 2006 the confusion arises since information can be easily stored on a computer and hence informatics could be considered the parent of computer science however the original notion of a computer was the name given to the action of computation regardless of the existence of information or the existence of a von neumann architecture humans are examples of computational systems and not information systems many fields such as quantum computing theory are studied in theoretical computer science but not related to informatics in 1989 the first international olympiad in informatics ioi was held in bulgaria the olympiad involves two five hour days of intense competition four students are selected from each participating country to attend and compete for gold silver and bronze medals the 2008 ioi was held in cairo egypt the first example of a degree level qualification in informatics occurred in 1982 when plymouth polytechnic now the university of plymouth offered a four year bsc honours degree in computing and informatics with an initial intake of only 35 students the course still runs today 6 making it the longest available qualification in the subject a broad interpretation of informatics as the study of the structure algorithms behaviour and interactions of natural and artificial computational systems was introduced by the university of edinburgh in 1994 when it formed the grouping that is now its school of informatics this meaning is now 2006 increasingly used in the united kingdom 7 the 2008 research assessment exercise of the uk funding councils includes a new computer science and informatics unit of assessment uoa 8 whose scope is described as follows the uoa includes the study of methods for acquiring storing processing communicating and reasoning about information and the role of interactivity in natural and artificial systems through the implementation organisation and use of computer hardware software and other resources the subjects are characterised by the rigorous application of analysis experimentation and design at the indiana university school of informatics bloomington indianapolis and southeast informatics is defined as the art science and human dimensions of information technology and the study application and social consequences of technology it is also defined in informatics 101 introduction to informatics as the application of information technology to the arts sciences and professions these definitions are widely accepted in the united states and differ from british usage in omitting the study of natural computation at the university of california irvine department of informatics informatics is defined as the interdisciplinary study of the design application use and impact of information technology the discipline of informatics is based on the recognition that the design of this technology is not solely a technical matter but must focus on the relationship between the technology and its use in real world settings that is informatics designs solutions in context and takes into account the social cultural and organizational settings in which computing and information technology will be used at the university of michigan ann arbor informatics interdisciplinary major informatics is defined as the study of information and the ways information is used by and affects human beings and social systems key to this growing field is that it applies both technological and social perspectives to the study of information michigan s interdisciplinary approach to teaching informatics gives you a solid grounding in contemporary computer programming mathematics and statistics combined with study of the ethical and social science aspects of complex information systems experts in the field help design new information technology tools for specific scientific business and cultural needs michigan offers four curricular tracks within the informatics degree to provide students with increased expertise these four track topics include 9 internet informatics an applied track in which students experiment with technologies behind internet based information systems and acquire skills to map problems to deployable internet based solutions this track will replace computational informatics in fall 2013 10 data mining amp information analysis integrates the collection analysis and visualization of complex data and its critical role in research business and government to provide students with practical skills and a theoretical basis for approaching challenging data analysis problems life science informatics examines artificial information systems which has helped scientists make great progress in identifying core components of organisms and ecosystems social computing advances in computing have created opportunities for studying patterns of social interaction and developing systems that act as introducers recommenders coordinators and record keepers students in this track craft evaluate and refine social software computer applications for engaging technology in unique social contexts this track will be phased out in fall 2013 in favor of the new bachelor of science in information this will be the first undergraduate degree offered by the school of information 11 one of the most significant areas of applied informatics is that of organisational informatics organisational informatics is fundamentally interested in the application of information information systems and ict within organisations of various forms including private sector public sector and voluntary sector organisations 12 13 as such organisational informatics can be seen to be sub category of social informatics and a super category of business informatics edit contributing disciplines computer science communication studies
