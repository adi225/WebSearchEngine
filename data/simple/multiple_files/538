a software engineer programming for the wikimedia foundation software engineering se is the application of a systematic disciplined quantifiable approach to the design development operation and maintenance of software and the study of these approaches that is the application of engineering to software 1 2 3 in layman s terms it is the act of using insights to conceive model and scale a solution to a problem the term software engineering first appeared in the 1968 nato software engineering conference and was meant to provoke thought regarding the perceived software crisis at the time 4 5 6 software development a much used and more generic term does not necessarily subsume the engineering paradigm the generally accepted concepts of software engineering as an engineering discipline have been specified in the guide to the software engineering body of knowledge swebok the swebok has become an internationally accepted standard iso iec tr 19759 2005 7 for those who wish to become recognized as professional software engineers the ieee offers two certifications certified software development associate and certified software development professional the ieee certifications do not use the term engineer in their title for compatibility reasons in some parts of the us such as texas the use of the term engineer is regulated only to those who have a professional engineer license further in the united states starting from 2013 the ncees professional engineer licences are available also for software engineers 8 contents 1 history 2 profession 2 1 employment 2 2 certification 2

appeared in the early 1940s 9 the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine practitioners quickly realized that this design was not flexible and came up with the stored program architecture or von neumann architecture thus the division between hardware and software began with abstraction being used to deal with the complexity of computing programming languages started to appear in the 1950s and this was also another major step in abstraction major languages such as fortran algol and cobol were released in the late 1950s to deal with scientific algorithmic and business problems respectively e w dijkstra wrote his seminal paper go to statement considered harmful 10 in 1968 and david parnas introduced the key concept of modularity and information hiding in 1972 11 to help programmers deal with the ever increasing complexity of software systems a software system for managing the hardware called an operating system was also introduced most notably by unix in 1969 in 1967 the simula language introduced the object oriented programming paradigm these advances in software were met with more advances in computer hardware in the mid 1970s the microcomputer was introduced making it economical for hobbyists to obtain a computer and write software for it this in turn led to the now famous personal computer pc and microsoft windows the software development life cycle or sdlc was also starting to appear as a consensus for centralized construction of software in the mid 1980s the late 1970s and early 1980s saw the introduction of several new simula inspired object oriented programming languages including smalltalk objective c and c open source software started to appear in the early 90s in the form of linux and other software introducing the bazaar or decentralized style of constructing software 12 then the world wide web and the popularization of the internet hit in the mid 90s changing the engineering of software once again distributed systems gained sway as a way to design systems and the java programming language was introduced with its own virtual machine as another step in abstraction programmers collaborated and wrote the agile manifesto which favored more lightweight processes to create cheaper and more timely software the current definition of software engineering is still being debated by practitioners today as they struggle to come up with ways to produce software that is cheaper better faster cost reduction has been a primary focus of the it industry since the 1990s total cost of ownership represents the costs of more than just acquisition it includes things like productivity impediments upkeep efforts and resources needed to support infrastructure edit profession main article software engineer legal requirements for the licensing or certification of professional software engineers vary around the world in the uk the british computer society licenses software engineers and members of the society can also become chartered engineers ceng while in some areas of canada such as alberta ontario 13 and quebec software engineers can hold the professional engineer p eng designation and or the information systems professional i s p designation in canada there is a legal requirement to have p eng when one wants to use the title engineer or practice software engineering in the usa beginning on 2013 the path for licensure of software engineers will become a reality as with the other engineering disciplines the requirements consist of earning an abet accredited bachelor s degree in software engineering or any non abet degree and ncees credentials evaluation passing the fundamentals of engineering exam having at least four years of demonstrably relevant experience and passing the software engineering pe exam in some states such as florida texas washington and other software developers cannot use the title engineer unless they are licensed professional engineers who have passed the pe exam and possess a valid licence to practice this license has to be periodically renewed which is known as continuous education to ensure engineers are kept up to date with latest techniques and safest practices 14 15 the ieee computer society and the acm the two main us based professional organizations of software engineering publish guides to the profession of software engineering the ieee s guide to the software engineering body of knowledge 2004 version or swebok defines the field and describes the knowledge the ieee expects a practicing software engineer to have currently the swebok v3 is being produced and will likely be released in mid 2013 16 the ieee also promulgates a software engineering code of ethics 17 edit employment in 2004 the u s bureau of labor statistics counted 760 840 software engineers holding jobs in the u s in the same time period there were some 1 4 million practitioners employed in the u s in all other engineering disciplines combined 18 due to its relative newness as a field of study formal education in software engineering is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum and many software engineers hold computer science degrees 19 many software engineers work as employees or contractors software engineers work with businesses government agencies civilian or military and non profit organizations some software engineers work for themselves as freelancers some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the software development process other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them in large projects people may specialize in only one role in small projects people may fill several or all roles at the same time specializations include in industry analysts architects developers testers technical support middleware analysts managers and in academia educators researchers most software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008 injuries in these occupations are rare however like other workers who spend long periods in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain back discomfort and hand and wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome 20 the field s future looks bright according to money magazine and salary com which rated software engineer as the best job in the united states in 2006 21 in 2012 software engineering was again ranked as the best job in the united states this time by careercast com 22 edit certification the software engineering institute offers certifications on specific topics like security process improvement and software architecture 23 apple ibm microsoft and other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations many it certification programs are oriented toward specific technologies and managed by the vendors of these technologies 24 these certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies broader certification of general software engineering skills is available through various professional societies as of 2006 update the ieee had certified over 575 software professionals as a certified software development professional csdp 25 in 2008 they added an entry level certification known as the certified software development associate csda 26 the acm had a professional certification program in the early 1980s citation needed which was discontinued due to lack of interest the acm examined the possibility of professional certification of software engineers in the late 1990s but eventually decided that such certification was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of software engineering 27 in 2012 validated guru began offering the certified software developer vgcsd certification which is heavily influenced by the global community in the u k the british computer society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called chartered it professional citp available to fully qualified members mbcs software engineers may be eligible for membership of the institution of engineering and technology and so qualify for chartered engineer status in canada the canadian information processing society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called information systems professional isp 28 in ontario canada software engineers who graduate from a canadian engineering accreditation board ceab accredited program successfully complete peo s professional engineers ontario professional practice examination ppe and have at least 48 months of acceptable engineering experience are eligible to be licensed through the professional engineers ontario and can become professional engineers p eng 29 the peo does not recognize any online or distance education however and does not consider computer science programs to be equivalent to software engineering programs despite the tremendous overlap between the two this has sparked controversy and a certification war it has also held the number of p eng holders for the profession exceptionally low the vast majority of working professionals in the field hold a degree in cs not se and given the difficult certification path for holders of non se degrees most never bother to pursue the license edit impact of globalization the initial impact of outsourcing and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in north america and europe to india and later china russia and other developing countries this approach had some flaws mainly the distance timezone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers but also the lower quality of the software developed by the outsourcing companies and the massive job transfer this had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession for example some students in the developed world avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing importing software products or services from other countries and of being displaced by foreign visa workers 30 although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself a related career computer programming does appear to have been affected 31 32 nevertheless the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near shore resources via the follow the sun workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations 33 when north americans are leaving work asians are just arriving to work when asians are leaving work europeans are arriving to work this provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business critical processes 24 hours per day without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource sleep patterns while global outsourcing has several advantages global and generally distributed development can run into serious difficulties resulting from the distance between developers this includes but is not limited to language communication cultural or corporate barriers handling global development successfully is subject to active research of the software engineering community edit education a knowledge of programming is a pre requisite to becoming a software engineer in 2004 the ieee computer society produced the swebok which has been published as iso iec technical report 19759 2004 describing the body of knowledge that they believe should be mastered by a graduate software engineer with four years of experience 34 many software engineers enter the profession by obtaining a university degree or training at a vocational school one standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by the ccse and updated in 2004 35 a number of universities have software engineering degree programs as of 2010 update there were 244 campus programs 70 online programs 230 masters level programs 41 doctorate level programs and 69 certificate level programs in the united states 36 in addition to university education many companies sponsor internships for students wishing to pursue careers in information technology these internships can introduce the student to interesting real world tasks that typical software engineers encounter every day similar experience can be gained through military service in software engineering edit comparison with other disciplines major differences between software engineering and other engineering disciplines according to some researchers result from the costs of fabrication 37 edit software process a set of activities that leads to the production of a software product is known as software process 38 although most of the softwares are custom build the software engineering market is being gradually shifted towards component based computer aided software engineering case tools are being used to support the software process activities however due to the vast diversity of software processes for different types of products the effectiveness of case tools is limited there is no ideal approach to software process that has yet been developed some fundamental activities like software specification design validation and maintainence are common to all the process activities 39 edit models a software process model is an abstraction of software process these are also called process paradigms various general process models are waterfall model evolutionary development model and component based software engineering model these are widely used in current software engineering practice for large systems these are used together 40 edit waterfall model the waterfall model was one of the first published model for the sofware process this model divides software processes in various phases these phases are 41 requirements analysis software design unit testing system testing maintenance theoretically the activities should be performed individually but in practice they often overlap during the maintenance stage the software is put into use during this additional problems might be discovered and the need of new feature may arise this may require the software to undergo the previous phases once again 42 edit subdisciplines software engineering can be divided into ten subdisciplines they are 1 software requirements the elicitation analysis specification and validation of requirements for software software design the process of defining the architecture components interfaces and other characteristics of a system or component it is also defined as the result of that process software construction the detailed creation of working meaningful software through a combination of coding verification unit testing integration testing and debugging software testing the dynamic verification of the behavior of a program on a finite set of test cases suitably selected from the usually infinite executions domain against the expected behavior software maintenance the totality of activities required to provide cost effective support to software software configuration management the identification of the configuration of a system at distinct points in time for the purpose of systematically controlling changes to the configuration and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration throughout the system life cycle software engineering management the application of management activities planning coordinating measuring monitoring controlling and reporting to ensure that the development and maintenance of software is systematic disciplined and quantified software engineering process the definition implementation assessment measurement management change and improvement of the software life cycle process itself software engineering tools and methods the computer based tools that are intended to assist the software life cycle processes see computer aided software engineering and the methods which impose structure on the software engineering activity with the goal of making the activity systematic and ultimately more likely to be successful and toher required tools which are use software quality the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements edit related disciplines software engineering is a direct subfield of computer science and has some relations with management science it is also considered a part of overall systems engineering edit systems engineering systems engineers deal primarily with the overall system requirements and design including hardware and human issues they are often concerned with partitioning functionality to hardware software or human operators therefore the output of the systems engineering process serves as an input to the software engineering process edit computer software engineers computer software engineers are usually systems level software engineering information systems computer science or software level computer
