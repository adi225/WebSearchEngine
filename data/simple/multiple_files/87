this article is about enterprise level cloud data storage for consumer level file hosting services see file hosting service cloud storage is a model of networked online storage where data is stored in virtualized pools of storage which are generally hosted by third parties hosting companies operate large data centers and people who require their data to be hosted buy or lease storage capacity from them the data center operators in the background virtualize the resources according to the requirements of the customer and expose them as storage pools which the customers can themselves use to store files or data objects physically the resource may span across multiple servers the safety of the files depends upon the hosting websites cloud storage services may be accessed through a web service application programming interface api a cloud storage gateway or through a web based user interface contents 1 architecture 2 advantages 3 potential concerns 3 1 attack surface area 3 2 supplier

characteristics as cloud computing in terms of agility scalability elasticity and multi tenancy and is available both off premise amazon ec2 and on premise vion capacity services 1 it is believed to have been invented by joseph carl robnett licklider in the 1960s 2 since the sixties cloud computing has developed along a number of lines with web 2 0 being the most recent evolution however since the internet only started to offer significant bandwidth in the nineties cloud computing for the masses has been something of a late developer it is difficult to pin down a canonical definition of cloud storage architecture but object storage is reasonably analogous cloud storage services like openstack cloud storage products like emc atmos and hitachi cloud services and distributed storage research projects like oceanstore 3 are all examples of object storage and infer the following guidelines cloud storage is 3 made up of many distributed resources but still acts as one highly fault tolerant through redundancy and distribution of data highly durable through the creation of versioned copies typically eventually consistent with regard to data replicas edit advantages companies need only pay for the storage they actually use as it is also possible for companies by utilizing actual virtual storage features like thin provisioning 4 organizations can choose between off premise and on premise cloud storage options or a mixture of the two options depending on relevant decision criteria that is complementary to initial direct cost savings potential for instance continuity of operations coop disaster recovery dr security pii hippa sarbox ia cnd and records retention laws regulations and policies 5 storage maintenance tasks such as backup data replication and purchasing additional storage devices are offloaded to the responsibility of a service provider allowing organizations to focus on their core business but the fact stays the same that someone has to pay for the administrative effort for these tasks 4 cloud storage provides users with immediate access to a broad range of resources and applications hosted in the infrastructure of another organization via a web service interface 6 cloud storage can be used for copying virtual machine images from the cloud to on premise locations or to import a virtual machine image from an on premise location to the cloud image library in addition cloud storage can be used to move virtual machine images between user accounts or between data centers 7 edit potential concerns main article cloud computing security edit attack surface area outsourcing data storage increases the attack surface area 8 the article referenced does not mention storage but refers generically to cloud computing when data is distributed it is stored at more locations increasing the risk of unauthorised physical access to the data for example in cloud based architecture data is replicated and moved frequently so the risk of unauthorised data recovery increases dramatically e g disposal of old equipment reuse of drives reallocation of storage space the manner that data is replicated depends on the service level a customer chooses and on the service provided different cloud vendors offer different service levels risk of unauthorized access to data can be mitigated through the use of encryption which can be applied to data as part of the storage service or by on premises equipment that encrypts data prior to uploading it to the cloud the number of people with access to the data who could be compromised i e bribed or coerced increases dramatically a single company might have a small team of administrators network engineers and technicians but a cloud storage company will have many customers and thousands of servers and therefore a much larger team of technical staff with physical and electronic access to almost all of the data at the entire facility or perhaps the entire company 9 encryption keys that are kept by the service user as opposed to the service provider limit the access to data by service provider employees it increases the number of networks over which the data travels instead of just a local area network lan or storage area network san data stored on a cloud requires a wan wide area network to connect them both by sharing storage and networks with many other users customers it is possible for other customers to access your data sometimes because of human error faulty equipment a bug and sometimes because of criminal intent this risk applies to all types of storage and not only cloud storage the risk of having data read during transmission can be mitigated through encryption technology encryption in transit protects data as it is being transmitted to and from the cloud service encryption at rest protects data that is stored at the service provider encrypting data in an on premises cloud service on ramp system can provide both kinds of encryption protection edit supplier stability see also financial analysis companies are not permanent and the services and products they provide can change outsourcing data storage to another company needs careful investigation and nothing is ever certain contracts set in stone can be worthless when a company ceases to exist or its circumstances change companies can go bankrupt expand and change their focus be purchased by other larger companies be purchased by a company headquartered in a country that negates compliance with u s government itar more information needed suffer an irrecoverable disaster edit accessibility performance for outsourced storage is likely to be lower than local storage depending on how much a customer is willing to spend for wan bandwidth 4 reliability and availability depends on wide area network availability and on the level of precautions taken by the service provider citation needed edit other concerns security of stored data and data in transit may be a concern when storing sensitive data at a cloud storage provider 4 users with specific records keeping requirements such as public agencies that must retain electronic records according to statute may encounter complications with using cloud computing and storage for instance the u s department of defense designated the defense information systems agency disa to maintain a list of records management products that meet all of the records retention personally identifiable information pii and security information assurance ia requirements 10 cloud storage is a rich resource for both hackers and national security agencies 11 12 piracy and copyright infringement may be enabled by sites that permit filesharing for example the codexcloud ebook storage site has faced litigation from the owners of the intellectual property uploaded and shared there as have the grooveshark and youtube sites it has been compared to 13 14 edit costs cloud storage may be cost efficient for many corporations and small businesses for everyday use but for the average user of the computer and internet the costs of cloud storage may outweigh its benefits as a result users have other alternatives of storage such as local wired hard drive local wireless hard drive external usb hard drive edit see also cloud collaboration cloud computing cloud database cloud storage gateway comparison of online backup services
