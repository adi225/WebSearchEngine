as a malignant neoplasm is a broad group of various diseases all involving unregulated cell growth in cancer cells divide and grow uncontrollably forming malignant tumors and invade nearby parts of the body the cancer may also spread to more distant parts of the body through the lymphatic system or bloodstream not all tumors are cancerous benign tumors do not grow uncontrollably do not invade neighboring tissues and do not spread throughout the body there are over 200 different known cancers that afflict humans 1 determining what causes cancer is complex many things are known to increase the risk of cancer including tobacco use certain infections radiation lack of physical activity obesity and environmental pollutants 2 these can directly damage genes or combine with existing genetic faults within cells to cause the disease 3 approximately five to ten percent of cancers are entirely hereditary cancer can be detected in a number of ways including the presence of certain signs and symptoms screening tests or medical imaging once a possible cancer is detected it is diagnosed by microscopic examination of a tissue sample cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy radiation therapy and surgery the chances of surviving the disease vary greatly by the type and location of the cancer and the extent of disease at the start of treatment while cancer can affect people of all ages and a few types of cancer are more common in children the risk of developing cancer generally increases with age in 2007 cancer caused about 13 of all human deaths worldwide 7 9 160 million rates are rising as more people live to an old age and as mass lifestyle changes occur in the developing world 4 contents 1 signs and symptoms 1 1 local effects 1 2 systemic symptoms 1 3 metastasis 2 causes

of cancer metastasis depend on the location of the tumor when cancer begins it invariably produces no symptoms with signs and symptoms only appearing as the mass continues to grow or ulcerates the findings that result depends on the type and location of the cancer few symptoms are specific with many of them also frequently occurring in individuals who have other conditions cancer is the new great imitator thus it is not uncommon for people diagnosed with cancer to have been treated for other diseases to which it was assumed their symptoms were due 5 local effects local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration for example mass effects from lung cancer can cause blockage of the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus making it difficult or painful to swallow and colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel resulting in changes in bowel habits masses of breast or testicles may be easily felt ulceration can cause bleeding which if it occurs in the lung will lead to coughing up blood in the bowels to anemia or rectal bleeding in the bladder to blood in the urine and in the uterus to vaginal bleeding although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer the initial swelling is usually painless some cancers can cause build up of fluid within the chest or abdomen 5 systemic symptoms general symptoms occur due to distant effects of the cancer that are not related to direct or metastatic spread these may include unintentional weight loss fever being excessively tired and changes to the skin 6 hodgkin disease leukemias and cancers of the liver or kidney can cause a persistent fever of unknown origin 5 specific constellations of systemic symptoms termed paraneoplastic phenomena may occur with some cancers examples include the appearance of myasthenia gravis in thymoma and clubbing in lung cancer 5 metastasis symptoms of metastasis are due to the spread of cancer to other locations in the body they can include enlarged lymph nodes which can be felt or sometimes seen under the skin and are typically hard hepatomegaly enlarged liver or splenomegaly enlarged spleen which can be felt in the abdomen pain or fracture of affected bones and neurological symptoms 5 causes cancers are primarily an environmental disease with 90 95 of cases attributed to environmental factors and 5 10 due to genetics 2 environmental as used by cancer researchers means any cause that is not inherited genetically not merely pollution 7 common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco 25 30 diet and obesity 30 35 infections 15 20 radiation both ionizing and non ionizing up to 10 stress lack of physical activity and environmental pollutants 2 it is nearly impossible to prove what caused a cancer in any individual because most cancers have multiple possible causes for example if a person who uses tobacco heavily develops lung cancer then it was probably caused by the tobacco use but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air pollution or radiation then there is a small chance that the cancer developed because of air pollution or radiation chemicals further information alcohol and cancer 160 and 160 smoking and cancer the incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking cancer pathogenesis is traceable back to dna mutations that impact cell growth and metastasis substances that cause dna mutations are known as mutagens and mutagens that cause cancers are known as carcinogens particular substances have been linked to specific types of cancer tobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer 8 and causes 90 of lung cancer 9 many mutagens are also carcinogens but some carcinogens are not mutagens alcohol is an example of a chemical carcinogen that is not a mutagen 10 in western europe 10 of cancers in males and 3 of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol 11 decades of research has demonstrated the link between tobacco use and cancer in the lung larynx head neck stomach bladder kidney esophagus and pancreas 12 tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 13 tobacco is responsible for about one in three of all cancer deaths in the developed world 8 and about one in five worldwide 13 lung cancer death rates in the united states have mirrored smoking patterns with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and more recently decreases in smoking rates since the 1950s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since 1990 14 15 however the numbers of smokers worldwide is still rising leading to what some organizations have described as the tobacco epidemic 16 cancer related to one s occupation is believed to represent between 2 20 of all cases 17 every year at least 200 000 people die worldwide from cancer related to their workplace 18 most cancer deaths caused by occupational risk factors occur in the developed world 18 it is estimated that approximately 20 000 cancer deaths and 40 000 new cases of cancer each year in the u s are attributable to occupation 19 millions of workers run the risk of developing cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma from inhaling asbestos fibers and tobacco smoke or leukemia from exposure to benzene at their workplaces 18 diet and exercise diet physical inactivity and obesity are related to approximately 30 35 of cancer deaths 2 20 in the united states excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in 14 20 of all cancer deaths 20 physical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on immune system and endocrine system 20 diets that are low in vegetables fruits and whole grains and high in processed or red meats are linked with a number of cancers 20 a high salt diet is linked to gastric cancer aflatoxin b1 a frequent food contaminate with liver cancer and betel nut chewing with oral cancer 21 this may partly explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries for example gastric cancer is more common in japan with its high salt diet 22 and colon cancer is more common in the united states immigrants develop the risk of their new country often within one generation suggesting a substantial link between diet and cancer 23 infection main article infectious causes of cancer worldwide approximately 18 of cancer deaths are related to infectious diseases 2 this proportion varies in different regions of the world from a high of 25 in africa to less than 10 in the developed world 2 viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but bacteria and parasites may also have an effect a virus that can cause cancer is called an oncovirus these include human papillomavirus cervical carcinoma epstein barr virus b cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma kaposi s sarcoma herpesvirus kaposi s sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas hepatitis b and hepatitis c viruses hepatocellular carcinoma and human t cell leukemia virus 1 t cell leukemias bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer as seen in helicobacter pylori induced gastric carcinoma 24 parasitic infections strongly associated with cancer include schistosoma haematobium squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder and the liver flukes opisthorchis viverrini and clonorchis sinensis cholangiocarcinoma 25 radiation main article radiation induced cancer up to 10 of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure including both ionizing radiation and non ionizing radiation 2 additionally the vast majority of non invasive cancers are non melanoma skin cancers caused by non ionizing ultraviolet radiation sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging and radon gas radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body in all animals and at any age although radiation induced solid tumors usually take 10 15 years and can take up to 40 years to become clinically manifest and radiation induced leukemias typically require 2 10 years to appear 26 some people such as those with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome or retinoblastoma are more susceptible than average to developing cancer from radiation exposure 26 children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation induced leukemia as adults radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect 26 ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen 26 residential exposure to radon gas for example has similar cancer risks as passive smoking 26 low dose exposures such as living near a nuclear power plant are generally believed to have no or very little effect on cancer development 26 radiation is a more potent source of cancer when it is combined with other cancer causing agents such as radon gas exposure plus smoking tobacco 26 unlike chemical or physical triggers for cancer ionizing radiation hits molecules within cells randomly if it happens to strike a chromosome it can break the chromosome result in an abnormal number of chromosomes inactivate one or more genes in the part of the chromosome that it hit delete parts of the dna sequence cause chromosome translocations or cause other types of chromosome abnormalities 26 major damage normally results in the cell dying but smaller damage may leave a stable partly functional cell that may be capable of proliferating and developing into cancer especially if tumor suppressor genes were damaged by the radiation 26 three independent stages appear to be involved in the creation of cancer with ionizing radiation morphological changes to the cell acquiring cellular immortality losing normal life limiting cell regulatory processes and adaptations that favor formation of a tumor 26 even if the radiation particle does not strike the dna directly it triggers responses from cells that indirectly increase the likelihood of mutations 26 medical use of ionizing radiation is a growing source of radiation induced cancers ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers but this may in some cases induce a second form of cancer 26 it is also used in some kinds of medical imaging one report estimates that approximately 29 000 future cancers could be related to the approximately 70 million ct scans performed in the us in 2007 27 it is estimated that 0 4 of cancers in 2007 in the united states are due to cts performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1 5 2 with rates of ct usage during this same time period 28 prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies 29 clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation especially the non ionizing medium wave uvb as the cause of most non melanoma skin cancers which are the most common forms of cancer in the world 29 non ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones electric power transmission and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the world health organization s international agency for research on cancer 30 heredity main article cancer syndrome the vast majority of cancers are non hereditary sporadic cancers hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect less than 0 3 of the population are carriers of a genetic mutation which has a large effect on cancer risk and these cause less than 3 10 of all cancer 31 some of these syndromes include certain inherited mutations in the genes brca1 and brca2 with a more than 75 risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer 31 and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer hnpcc or lynch syndrome which is present in about 3 of people with colorectal cancer 32 among others physical agents some substances cause cancer primarily through their physical rather than chemical effects on cells 33 a prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos naturally occurring mineral fibers which are a major cause of mesothelioma a type of cancer of the serous membrane 33 other substances in this category including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos like fibers such as wollastonite attapulgite glass wool and rock wool are believed to have similar effects 33 nonfibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel and crystalline silica quartz cristobalite and tridymite 33 usually physical carcinogens must get inside the body such as through inhaling tiny pieces and require years of exposure to develop cancer 33 physical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare 34 claims that breaking bone resulted in bone cancer for example have never been proven 34 similarly physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer breast cancer or brain cancer 34 one accepted source is frequent long term application of hot objects to the body it is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters charcoal hand warmers may produce skin cancer especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present 34 frequently drinking scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer 34 generally it is believed that the cancer arises or a pre existing cancer is encouraged during the process of repairing the trauma rather than the cancer being caused directly by the trauma 34 however repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation there is no evidence that inflammation itself causes cancer 34 hormones some hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation 35 hormones are important agents in sex related cancers such as cancer of the breast endometrium prostate ovary and testis and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer 35 an individual s hormone levels are mostly determined genetically so this may at least partly explains the presence of some cancers that run in families that do not seem to have any cancer causing genes 35 for example the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer these higher hormone levels may explain why these women have higher risk of breast cancer even in the absence of a breast cancer gene 35 similarly men of african ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of european ancestry and have a correspondingly much higher level of prostate cancer 35 men of asian ancestry with the lowest levels of testosterone activating androstanediol glucuronide have the lowest levels of prostate cancer 35 however non genetic factors are also relevant obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers 35 women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones 35 on the other hand people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones and lower risk of cancer 35 osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones 35 some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels and thus discouraging hormone sensitive cancers 35 other excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and only a marginal few organ donors cancer is generally not a transmissible disease the main reason for this is tissue graft rejection caused by mhc incompatibility 36 in humans and other vertebrates the immune system uses mhc antigens to differentiate between self and non self cells because these antigens are different from person to person when non self antigens are encountered the immune system reacts against the appropriate cell such reactions may protect against tumour cell engraftment by eliminating implanted cells in the united states approximately 3 500 pregnant women have a malignancy annually and transplacental transmission of acute leukaemia lymphoma melanoma and carcinoma from mother to fetus has been observed 36 the development of donor derived tumors from organ transplants is exceedingly rare the main cause of organ transplant associated tumors seems to be malignant melanoma that was undetected at the time of organ harvest 37 cancer from one organism will usually grow in another organism of that species as long as they share the same histocompatibility genes 38 proven using mice however this would never happen in a real world setting except as described above in non humans a few types of transmissible cancer have been described wherein the cancer spreads between animals by transmission of the tumor cells themselves this phenomenon is seen in dogs with sticker s sarcoma also known as canine transmissible venereal tumor 39 as well as devil facial tumour disease in tasmanian devils pathophysiology main article carcinogenesis cancers are caused by a series of mutations each mutation alters the behavior of the cell somewhat cancer is fundamentally a disease of failure of regulation of tissue growth in order for a normal cell to transform into a cancer cell the genes which regulate cell growth and differentiation must be altered 40 the affected genes are divided into two broad categories oncogenes are genes which promote cell growth and reproduction tumor suppressor genes are genes which inhibit cell division and survival malignant transformation can occur through the formation of novel oncogenes the inappropriate over expression of normal oncogenes or by the under expression or disabling of tumor suppressor genes typically changes in many genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell 41 genetic changes can occur at different levels and by different mechanisms the gain or loss of an entire chromosome can occur through errors in mitosis more common are mutations which are changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic dna large scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains many copies often 20 or more of a small chromosomal locus usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused often at a characteristic location a well known example of this is the philadelphia chromosome or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia and results in production of the bcr abl fusion protein an oncogenic tyrosine kinase small scale mutations include point mutations deletions and insertions which may occur in the promoter region of a gene and affect its expression or may occur in the gene s coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a dna virus or retrovirus and resulting in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants replication of the enormous amount of data contained within the dna of living cells will probabilistically result in some errors mutations complex error correction and prevention is built into the process and safeguards the cell against cancer if significant error occurs the damaged cell can self destruct through programmed cell death termed apoptosis if the error control processes fail then the mutations will survive and be passed along to daughter cells some environments make errors more likely to arise and propagate such environments can include the presence of disruptive substances called carcinogens repeated physical injury heat ionising radiation or hypoxia 42 the errors which cause cancer are self amplifying and compounding for example a mutation in the error correcting machinery of a cell might cause that cell and its children to accumulate errors more rapidly a further mutation in an oncogene might cause the cell to reproduce more rapidly and more frequently than its normal counterparts a further mutation may cause loss of a tumour suppressor gene disrupting the apoptosis signalling pathway and resulting in the cell becoming immortal a further mutation in signaling machinery of the cell might send error causing signals to nearby cells the transformation of normal cell into cancer is akin to a chain reaction caused by initial errors which compound into more severe errors each progressively allowing the cell to escape the controls that limit normal tissue growth this rebellion like scenario becomes an undesirable survival of the fittest where the driving forces of evolution work against the body s design and enforcement of order once cancer has begun to develop this ongoing process termed clonal evolution drives progression towards more invasive stages 43 diagnosis chest x ray showing lung cancer in the left lung most cancers are initially recognized either because of the appearance of signs or symptoms or through screening neither of these lead to a definitive diagnosis which requires the examination of a tissue sample by a pathologist people with suspected cancer are investigated with medical tests these commonly include blood tests x rays ct scans and endoscopy classification further information list of cancer types and list of oncology related terms cancers are classified by the type of cell that the tumor cells resemble and is therefore presumed to be the origin of the tumor these types include carcinoma cancers derived from epithelial cells this group includes many of the most common cancers particularly in the aged and include nearly all those developing in the breast prostate lung pancreas and colon sarcoma cancers arising from connective tissue i e bone cartilage fat nerve each of which develop from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside the bone marrow lymphoma and leukemia these two classes of cancer arise from hematopoietic blood forming cells that leave the marrow and tend to mature in the lymph nodes and blood respectively leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children accounting for about 30 44 germ cell tumor cancers derived from pluripotent cells most often presenting in the testicle or the ovary seminoma and dysgerminoma respectively blastoma cancers derived from immature precursor cells or embryonic tissue blastomas are more common in children than in older adults cancers are usually named using carcinoma sarcoma or blastoma as a suffix with the latin or greek word for the organ or tissue of origin as the root for example cancers of the liver parenchyma arising from malignant epithelial cells is called hepatocarcinoma while a malignancy arising from primitive liver precursor cells is called a hepatoblastoma and a cancer arising from fat cells is called a liposarcoma for some common cancers the english organ name is used for example the most common type of breast cancer is called ductal carcinoma of the breast here the adjective ductal refers to the appearance of the cancer under the microscope which suggests that it has originated in the milk ducts benign tumors which are not cancers are named using oma as a suffix with the organ name as the root for example a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells is called a leiomyoma the common name of this frequently occurring benign tumor in the uterus is fibroid confusingly some types of cancer use the noma suffix examples including melanoma and seminoma some types of cancer are named for the size and shape of the cells under a microscope such as giant cell carcinoma spindle cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma pathology the tissue diagnosis given by the pathologist indicates the type of cell that is proliferating its histological grade genetic abnormalities and other features of the tumor together this information is useful to evaluate the prognosis of the patient and to choose the best treatment cytogenetics and immunohistochemistry are other types of testing that the pathologist may perform on the tissue specimen these tests may provide information about the molecular changes such as mutations fusion genes and numerical chromosome changes that has happened in the cancer cells and may thus also indicate the future behavior of the cancer prognosis and best treatment an invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast pale area at the center surrounded by spikes of whitish scar tissue and yellow fatty tissue an invasive colorectal carcinoma top center in a colectomy specimen a squamous cell carcinoma the whitish tumor near the bronchi in a lung specimen a large invasive ductal carcinoma in a mastectomy specimen prevention cancer prevention is defined as active measures to decrease the risk of cancer 45 the vast majority of cancer cases are due to environmental risk factors and many but not all of these environmental factors are controllable lifestyle choices thus cancer is considered a largely preventable disease 46 greater than 30 of cancer deaths could be prevented by avoiding risk factors including tobacco overweight obesity an insufficient diet physical inactivity alcohol sexually transmitted infections and air pollution 47 not all environmental causes are controllable such as naturally occurring background radiation and other cases of cancer are caused through hereditary genetic disorders and thus it is not possible to prevent all cases of cancer dietary main article diet and cancer while many dietary recommendations have been proposed to reduce the risk of cancer few have significant supporting scientific evidence 48 the primary dietary factors that increase risk are obesity and alcohol consumption with a diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in red meat being implicated but not confirmed 49 50 consumption of coffee is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer 51 studies have linked consumption of red or processed meat to an increased risk of breast cancer colon cancer and pancreatic cancer a phenomenon which could be due to the presence of carcinogens in meats cooked at high temperatures 52 53 dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include an emphasis on vegetables fruit whole grains and fish and an avoidance of red meat animal fats and refined carbohydrates however these recommendations are based on relatively limited evidence 48 medication the concept that medications can be used to prevent cancer is attractive and evidence supports their use in a few defined circumstances 54 in the general population nsaids reduce the risk of colorectal cancer however due to the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects they cause overall harm when used for prevention 55 aspirin has been found to reduce the risk of death from cancer by about 7 56 cox 2 inhibitor may decrease the rate of polyp formation in people with familial adenomatous polyposis however are associated with the same adverse effects as nsaids 57 daily use of tamoxifen or raloxifene has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in high risk women 58 the benefit verses harm for 5 alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride is not clear 59 vitamins have not been found to be effective at preventing cancer 60 although low blood levels of vitamin d are correlated with increased cancer risk 61 62 whether this relationship is causal and vitamin d supplementation is protective is not determined 63 beta carotene supplementation has been found to increase lung cancer rates in those who are high risk 64 folic acid supplementation has not been found effective in preventing colon cancer and may increase colon polyps 65 vaccination vaccines have been developed that prevent some infection by some viruses 66 human papillomavirus vaccine gardasil and cervarix decreases the risk of developing cervical cancer 66 the hepatitis b vaccine prevents infection with hepatitis b virus and thus decreases the risk of liver cancer 66 screening main article cancer screening unlike diagnosis efforts prompted by symptoms and medical signs cancer screening involves efforts to detect cancer after it has formed but before any noticeable symptoms appear 67 this may involve physical examination blood or urine tests or medical imaging 67 cancer screening is currently not possible for many types of cancers and even when tests are available they may not be recommended for everyone universal screening or mass screening involves screening everyone 68 selective screening identifies people who are known to be at higher risk of developing cancer such as people with a family history of cancer 68 several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening 67 these factors include possible harms from the screening test for example x ray images involve exposure to potentially harmful ionizing radiation the likelihood of the test correctly identifying cancer the likelihood of cancer being present screening is not normally useful for rare cancers possible harms from follow up procedures whether suitable treatment is available whether early detection improves treatment outcomes whether the cancer will ever need treatment whether the test is acceptable to the people if a screening test is too burdensome for example being extremely painful then people will refuse to participate 68 cost of the test recommendations the u s preventive services task force uspstf strongly recommends cervical cancer screening in women who are sexually active and have a cervix at least until the age of 65 69 they recommend that americans be screened for colorectal cancer via fecal occult blood testing sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy starting at age 50 until age 75 70 there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for skin cancer 71 oral cancer 72 lung cancer 73 or prostate cancer in men under 75 74 routine screening is not recommended for bladder cancer 75 testicular cancer 76 ovarian cancer 77 pancreatic cancer 78 or prostate cancer 79 the uspstf recommends mammography for breast cancer screening every two years for those 50 74 160 years old however they do not recommend either breast self examination or clinical breast examination 80 a 2011 cochrane review came to slightly different conclusions with respect to breast cancer screening stating that routine mammography may do more harm than good 81 japan screens for gastric cancer using photofluorography due to the high incidence there 4 genetic testing see also cancer syndrome gene cancer types brca1 brca2 breast ovarian pancreatic hnpcc mlh1 msh2 msh6 pms1 pms2 colon uterine small bowel stomach urinary tract genetic testing for individuals at high risk of certain cancers is recommended 82 carriers of these mutations may than undergo enhanced surveillance chemoprevention or preventative surgery to reduce their subsequent risk 82 management main article management of cancer many management options for cancer exist with the primary ones including surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy and palliative care which treatments are used depends upon the type location and grade of the cancer as well as the person s health and wishes palliative care palliative care refers to treatment which attempts to make the patient feel better and may or may not be combined with an attempt to attack the cancer palliative care includes action to reduce the physical emotional spiritual and psycho social distress experienced by people with cancer unlike treatment that is aimed at directly killing cancer cells the primary goal of palliative care is to improve the patient s quality of life patients at all stages of cancer treatment need some kind of palliative care to comfort them in some cases medical specialty professional organizations recommend that patients and physicians respond to cancer only with palliative care and not with cancer directed therapy 83 those cases have the following characteristics 84 patient has low performance status corresponding with limited ability to care for oneself 83 patient received no benefit from prior evidence based treatments 83 patient is ineligible to participate in any appropriate clinical trial 83 the physician sees no strong evidence that treatment would be effective 83 palliative care is often confused with hospice and therefore only involved when people approach end of life like hospice care palliative care attempts to help the person cope with the immediate needs and to increase the person s comfort unlike hospice care palliative care does not require people to stop treatment aimed at prolonging their lives or curing the cancer multiple national medical guidelines recommend early palliative care for people whose cancer has produced distressing symptoms pain shortness of breath fatigue nausea or who need help coping with their illness in people who have metastatic disease when first diagnosed oncologists should consider a palliative care consult immediately additionally an oncologist should consider a palliative care consult in any patient they feel has a prognosis of less than 12 months even if continuing aggressive treatment 85 86 87 surgery surgery is the primary method of treatment of most isolated solid cancers and may play a role in palliation and prolongation of survival it is typically an important part of making the definitive diagnosis and staging the tumor as biopsies are usually required in localized cancer surgery typically attempts to remove the entire mass along with in certain cases the lymph nodes in the area for some types of cancer this is all that is needed to eliminate the cancer 88 chemotherapy chemotherapy in addition to surgery has proven useful in a number of different cancer types including breast cancer colorectal cancer pancreatic cancer osteogenic sarcoma testicular cancer ovarian cancer and certain lung cancers 88 the effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by toxicity to other tissues in the body radiation radiation therapy involves the use of ionizing radiation in an attempt to either cure or improve the symptoms of cancer it is used in about half of all cases and the radiation can be from either internal sources in the form of brachytherapy or external sources radiation is typically used in addition to surgery and or chemotherapy but for certain types of cancer such as early head and neck cancer may be used alone for painful bone metastasis it has been found to be effective in about 70 of people 89 alternative treatments complementary and alternative cancer treatments are a diverse group of practices and products 90 complementary medicine refers to methods and substances which may be used along with conventional medicine and may form part of evidence based medicine while alternative medicine refers to treatments which have either not been tested scientifically or have been tested and found not to work 91 most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been rigorously studied or tested some alternative treatments have been investigated and shown to be ineffective but still continue to be marketed and promoted 92 prognosis see also cancer survivor cancer has a reputation as a deadly disease taken as a whole about half of people receiving treatment for invasive cancer excluding carcinoma in situ and non melanoma skin cancers die from cancer or its treatment 4 survival is worse in the developing world 4 however the survival rates vary dramatically by type of cancer with the range running from basically all people surviving to almost no one surviving those who survive cancer are at increased risk of developing a second primary cancer at about twice the rate of those never diagnosed with cancer 93 the increased risk is believed to be primarily due to the same risk factors that produced the first cancer partly due to the treatment for the first cancer and potentially related to better compliance with screening 93 predicting either short term or long term survival is difficult and depends on many factors the most important factors are the particular kind of cancer and the patient s age and overall health people who are frail with many other health problems have lower survival rates than otherwise healthy people a centenarian is unlikely to survive for five years even if the treatment is successful people who report a higher quality of life tend to survive longer 94 people with lower quality of life may be affected by major depressive disorder and other complications from cancer treatment and or disease progression that both impairs their quality of life and reduces their quantity of life additionally patients with worse prognoses may be depressed or report a lower quality of life directly because they correctly perceive that their condition is likely to be fatal epidemiology main article epidemiology of cancer death rate from malignant cancer per 100 000 160 inhabitants in 2004 95 160 160 no data 160 160 160 55 160 160 55 80 160 160 80 105 160 160 105 130 160 160 130 155 160 160 155 180 160 160 180 205 160 160 205 230 160

million people died of cancer worldwide 4 cancers as a group account for approximately 13 of all deaths each year with the most common being lung cancer 1 4 million deaths stomach cancer 740 000 deaths liver cancer 700 000 deaths colorectal cancer 610 000 deaths and breast cancer 460 000 deaths 96 this makes invasive cancer the leading cause of death in the developed world and the second leading cause of death in the developing world 4 over half of cases occur in the developing world 4 global cancer rates have been increasing primarily due to an aging population and lifestyle changes in the developing world 4 the most significant risk factor for developing cancer is old age 97 although it is possible for cancer to strike at any age most people who are diagnosed with invasive cancer are over the age of 65 97 according to cancer researcher robert a weinberg if we lived long enough sooner or later we all would get cancer 98 some of the association between aging and cancer is attributed to immunosenescence 99 errors accumulated in dna over a lifetime 100 and age related changes in the endocrine system 101 some slow growing cancers are particularly common autopsy studies in europe and asia have shown that up to 36 of people have undiagnosed and apparently harmless thyroid cancer at the time of their deaths and that 80 of men develop prostate cancer by age 80 102 103 as these cancers did not cause the person s death identifying them would have represented overdiagnosis rather than useful medical care the three most common childhood cancers are leukemia 34 brain tumors 23 and lymphomas 12 104 rates of childhood cancer have increased by 0 6 per year between 1975 to 2002 in the united states 105 and by 1 1 per year between 1978 and 1997 in europe 104 history main article history of cancer engraving with two views of a dutch woman who had a tumor removed from her neck in 1689 the earliest written record regarding cancer is from 3000 bc in the egyptian edwin smith papyrus and describes cancer of the breast 106 cancer however has existed for all of human history 106 hippocrates ca 460 bc ca 370 bc described several kinds of cancer referring to them with the greek word carcinos crab or crayfish 106 this name comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumour with the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet whence it derives its name 107 celsus ca 25 bc 50 ad translated carcinos into the latin cancer also meaning crab and recommended surgery as treatment 106 galen 2nd century ad disagreed with the use of surgery and recommended purgatives instead 106 these recommendations largely stood for 1000 years 106 in the 15th 16th and 17th centuries it became more acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death 108 the german professor wilhelm fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct the dutch professor francois de la boe sylvius a follower of descartes believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes and that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer his contemporary nicolaes tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads and concluded that it was contagious 109 the physician john hill described tobacco snuff as the cause of nose cancer in 1761 108 this was followed by the report in 1775 by british surgeon percivall pott that cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps 110 with the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century it was discovered that the cancer poison spread from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites metastasis this view of the disease was first formulated by the english surgeon campbell de morgan between 1871 and 1874 111 society and culture though many diseases such as heart failure may have a worse prognosis than most cases of cancer cancer is the subject of widespread fear and taboos the euphemism after a long illness is still commonly used 2012 reflecting an apparent stigma 112 this deep belief that cancer is necessarily a difficult and usually deadly disease is reflected in the systems chosen by society to compile cancer statistics the most common form of cancer non melanoma skin cancers accounting for about one third of all cancer cases worldwide but very few deaths 113 114 are excluded from cancer statistics specifically because they are easily treated and almost always cured often in a single short outpatient procedure 115 cancer is regarded as a disease that must be fought to end the civil insurrection a war on cancer has been declared military metaphors are particularly common in descriptions of cancer s human effects and they emphasize both the parlous state of the affected individual s health and the need for the individual to take immediate decisive actions himself rather than to delay to ignore or to rely entirely on others caring for him the military metaphors also help rationalize radical destructive treatments 116 117 in the 1970s a relatively popular alternative cancer treatment was a specialized form of talk therapy based on the idea that cancer was caused by a bad attitude 118 people with a cancer personality depressed repressed self loathing and afraid to express their emotions were believed to have manifested cancer through subconscious desire some psychotherapists said that treatment to change the patient s outlook on life would cure the cancer 118 among other effects this belief allows society to blame the victim for having caused the cancer by wanting it or having prevented its cure by not becoming a sufficiently happy fearless and loving person 119 it also increases patients anxiety as they incorrectly believe that natural emotions of sadness anger or fear shorten their lives 119 the idea was excoriated by the notoriously outspoken susan sontag who published illness as metaphor while recovering from treatment for breast cancer in 1978 118 although the original idea is now generally regarded as nonsense the idea partly persists in a reduced form with a widespread but incorrect belief that deliberately cultivating a habit of positive thinking will increase survival 119 this notion is particularly strong in breast cancer culture 119 in 2007 the overall costs of cancer in the u s including treatment and indirect mortality expenses such as lost productivity in the workplace was estimated to be 226 8 billion in 2009 32 of hispanics and 10 of children 17 years old or younger lacked health insurance uninsured patients and those from ethnic minorities are substantially more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at a later stage when treatment can be more extensive and more costly 120 research main article cancer research because cancer is a class of diseases 121 122 it is unlikely that there will ever be a single cure for cancer any more than there will be a single treatment for all infectious diseases 123 angiogenesis inhibitors were once thought to have potential as a silver bullet treatment applicable to many types of cancer but this has not been the case in practice 124 experimental cancer treatments are treatments that are being studied to see whether they work typically these are studied in clinical trials to compare the proposed treatment to the best existing treatment they may be entirely new treatments or they may be treatments that have been used successfully in one type of cancer and are now being tested to see whether they are effective in another type 125 more and more such treatments are being developed alongside companion diagnostic tests to target the right drugs to the right patients based on their individual biology 126 cancer research is the intense scientific effort to understand disease processes and discover possible therapies research about cancer causes focuses on the following issues agents e g viruses and events e g mutations which cause or facilitate genetic changes in cells destined to become cancer the precise nature of the genetic damage and the genes which are affected by it the consequences of those genetic changes on the biology of the cell both in generating the defining properties of a cancer cell and in facilitating additional genetic events which lead to further progression of the cancer the improved understanding of molecular biology and cellular biology due to cancer research has led to a number of new treatments for cancer since u s president nixon declared the war on cancer in 1971 since then the u s has spent over 200 billion on cancer research including resources from the public and private sectors and foundations 127 during that time the country has seen a five percent decrease in the cancer death rate adjusting for size and age of the population between 1950 and 2005 128 in pregnancy because cancer is largely a disease of older adults it is not common in pregnant women cancer affects approximately 1 in 1 000 pregnant women 129 the most common cancers found during pregnancy are the same as the most common cancers found in non pregnant women during childbearing ages breast cancer cervical cancer leukemia lymphoma melanoma ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer 129 diagnosing a new cancer in a pregnant woman is difficult in part because any symptoms are commonly assumed to be a normal discomfort associated with pregnancy 129 as a result cancer is typically discovered at a somewhat later stage than average in many pregnant or recently pregnant women some imaging procedures such as mris magnetic resonance imaging ct scans ultrasounds and mammograms with fetal shielding are considered safe during pregnancy some others such as pet scans are not 129 treatment is generally the same as for non pregnant women 129 however radiation and radioactive drugs are normally avoided during pregnancy especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cgy in some cases some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy early deliveries to speed the start of treatment are not uncommon surgery is generally safe but pelvic surgeries during the first trimester may cause miscarriage some treatments especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the first trimester increase the risk of birth defects and pregnancy loss spontaneous abortions and stillbirths 129 elective abortions are not required and for the most common forms and stages of cancer do not improve the likelihood of the mother surviving or being cured 129 in a few instances such as advanced uterine cancer the pregnancy cannot be continued and in others such as an acute leukemia discovered early in pregnancy the pregnant woman may choose to have abortion so that she can begin aggressive chemotherapy without worrying about birth defects 129 some treatments may interfere with the mother s ability to give birth vaginally or to breastfeed her baby 129 cervical cancer may require birth by caesarean section radiation to the breast reduces the ability of that breast to produce milk and increases the risk of mastitis also when chemotherapy is being given after birth many of the drugs pass through breast milk to the baby which could harm the baby 129 notes how many different types of cancer are there 160 cancer research uk 160 cancerhelp uk http cancerhelp
