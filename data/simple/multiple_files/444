closed circuit television cameras such as these can be used to take the images scanned by automatic number plate recognition systems the uk has an extensive automatic number plate recognition anpr cctv network police and security services use it to track uk vehicle movements in real time the resulting data are stored for 5 years in the national anpr data centre to be analyzed for intelligence and to be used as evidence 1 following the formation of the conservative liberal democrat coalition after the 2010 general election it was announced in july 2010 that the system is to be placed under statutory regulation this is likely to establish a right in law to collect the data and place controls on its use storage and access by third parties 2 the protection of freedoms act 2012 was enacted

uses two hundred and thirty cameras and anpr to help monitor vehicles in the charging zone since march 2006 most motorways main roads town centres london s congestion charge zone 3 ports and petrol station forecourts have been covered by cctv camera networks using automatic number plate recognition existing traffic cameras in towns and cities are being converted to read number plates automatically as part of the new national surveillance network what we re trying to do as far as we can is to stitch together the existing camera network rather than install a huge number of new cameras mr whiteley chairman of the anpr steering committee said 1 some cameras may be disguised for covert operations but the majority will be ordinary cctv traffic cameras converted to read number plates 1 every police force will also have a fleet of specially fitted police vans with anpr cameras 1 all data generated is fed to the national anpr data centre one camera can cover many motorway lanes just two anpr devices for instance cover north and south movements through the 27 lanes of the dartford crossing toll area on the thames whiteley said the intention eventually was to move from the low thousands of cameras to the high thousands 1 edit national anpr data centre the national anpr data centre stores all anpr data feed from the various police and civic cctv networks in the uk 4 the national anpr data centre is based at hendon in north london the site of the existing police national computer in march 2006 the national anpr data centre could store 50 million number plate reads per day 5 to be expanded to 100 million reads per day within a couple of years the time date and place of each vehicle sighting will be stored for two years 1 at the present 50 million clocks a day over 18 billion anpr records would be recorded every year according to the national policing improvement agency 25 000 hits per day against the anpr database generate a transaction against the police national computer 6 edit crosschecks cctv cameras the national anpr data centre is being built alongside the police national computer because of the need to be constantly updated with lists of suspect drivers and vehicles 1 car registrations are checked against lists from the police national computer including vehicles of interest to the police for crimes such as burglary or theft of petrol uninsured drivers will be identified from data provided by the insurance industry vehicles without a valid mot test certificate will be flagged and vehicles without a valid tax disc or with unlawful number plates will be identified the national anpr data centre allows analysis across police force boundaries 4 if a vehicle enters the anpr network the police should have an image of it entering the area which may also show the driver and passenger as the data generated is stored for two years the police argue criminals could be identified and linked to vehicles 4 edit data mining a major feature of the national anpr data centre for car numbers is the ability to data mine advanced versatile automated data mining software trawls through the vast amounts of data collected finding patterns and meaning in the data data mining can be used on the records of previous sightings to build up intelligence of a vehicle s movements on the road network or can be used to find cloned vehicles by searching the database for impossibly quick journeys 1 4 we can use anpr on investigations or we can use it looking forward in a proactive intelligence way things like building up the lifestyle of criminals where they are going to be at certain times we seek to link the criminal to the vehicle through intelligence vehicles moving on the roads are open to police scrutiny at any time the road traffic act gives us the right to stop vehicles at any time for any purpose frank whiteley chief constable of hertfordshire and chair of the acpo anpr steering group 1 edit the database the national anpr data centre uses an oracle database with data for analysis extracted to a postgresql database to avoid affecting core performance and custom written java software with specific police networks rather than the internet used to send and receive data 4 the design of the system will also take into account future changes to the way cars will be recognised such as electronic vehicle identification when a unique identity chip is built in to the bodywork 1 edit data access edit police the police have real time access to all anpr camera data effectively the police and the security services can track any car technically any numberplate around the country in close to real time 3 every police force will have direct computer access to the national anpr data centre the current restraints on police use of anpr data have been dictated by pragmatism rather than a concern for civil liberties giving every police officer free access to the system would overload the system make it unstable slow it down said john dean national anpr co ordinator for the association of chief police officers 5 anpr records younger than 91 days can only be accessed on the nadc with an inspector s authority to investigate serious and major crime enquiries over 90 days to a year require a superintendent s authority and any searches over a year require a superintendent s authority and must be for counter terrorism only police in west yorkshire are working out how to arm bobbies on the beat with the national anpr data centre west yorkshire police asked rim maker of the blackberry handheld computer given to his constables about the technicalities of an anpr link the police have most streets of bradford covered by anpr cameras while leeds is being wired once that s stable we ll look at taking it onto blackberry 5 mobile anpr systems such as provida anpr are becoming more popular with forces having systems in traffic police intercept cars the advantage of this is that officers can get real time hits from passing vehicles as they are on patrol edit anpr cases edit positive use in august 2004 a presentation by john dean the association of chief police officers acpo national anpr co ordinator at ifsec revealed how anpr was being used to deny criminals the use of the road 7 on 18 november 2005 british police constable sharon beshenivsky was shot and killed during a robbery in bradford the cctv network was linked in to an anpr system and was able to identify the getaway car and track its movements leading to the arrest of six suspects at its launch in may ch supt geoff dodd of west yorkshire police called the anpr system a revolutionary tool in detecting crime 8 edit car cloning the success of anpr in detecting vehicles of interest to police has led to a new kind of crime car cloning criminals target vehicles of the same make and model to copy these number plates so that anpr systems will record a read on the make and model relating to a fake licence plate any legal transgressions could then lead to the legitimate owner receiving notification of enforcement action instead of the criminal there is very little monitoring of licence plate manufacture particularly websites offering vanity plates plates that are usable only in off road circumstances such as car shows and this gives criminals avenues to attempt to evade detection however anpr will often show that there are multiple vehicles using the same registration number and prove that the genuine owner is innocent as well as providing images to identify the culprits 9 edit project champion project champion is a project to install a 3m network of 169 anpr cameras to monitor vehicles entering and leaving the sparkbrook and washwood heath neighbourhoods of birmingham both of which have large muslim communities its implementation was frozen in june 2010 amid allegations that the police deliberately misled councillors about its purpose after it was revealed that it was being funded as an anti terrorism initiative rather than for reassurance and crime prevention 10 11 edit history edit project laser in the united kingdom in march 2005 plans were announced to set up a nationwide system of over 2 000 automatic number plate recognition cameras in the united kingdom this followed the successful rollout of project spectrum in which all 43 police forces in england and wales were supplied by the home office with an anpr capable mobile unit and a back office a subsequent series of trials were then commenced in 2002 when the vehicle and operator services agency vosa was given funding by the home office to work with the police standards unit and develop project laser using the equipment supplied under project spectrum with the aim of running the anpr system nationwide it was initially trialled by nine police forces and ran between 30 september 2002 and march 2003 those police forces covered the areas of greater manchester north wales avon and somerset northampton london kent west yorkshire staffordshire and west midlands the second phase of the project ran between 1 june 2003 and 21 june 2004 and involved 23 police forces in total the dvla is also involved with project laser using the system to gather details on unregistered and unlicensed vehicles and those without a valid mot certificate or insurance cover eventually the database will link to most cctv systems in town centres meaning that all vehicles filmed on one of the many cameras protecting bedford high street for instance can be checked against the database and the movements of wanted cars traced to help with serious crime investigations bedfordshire police the project was seen as a success despite a home office report showing that the driver and vehicle licensing agency dvla trial had an error rate of up to 40 with claims that the system was contributing in excess of 100 arrests per officer per year ten times the national average 12 further findings went on to show that the error rate dropped to 5 when infrared systems and more regular updates of information were used during the second phase of the project around 28 million number plates were spotted in total with 1 1 million 3 9 of these matching an entry in one of the databases 180 543 vehicles were stopped 101 775 directly because of the anpr system leading to 13 499 arrests 7 5 of the total and the issue of 50 910 fines 28 2 1 152 stolen vehicles worth 7 5 million in total 380 000 worth of drugs and 640 000 worth of stolen goods were also recovered the primary goal of the second phase was to see how well the costs of the anpr system could be covered the final conclusion was that less than 10 of the expenditure incurred was recouped with the home office claiming that the failure of drivers to pay fines contributed to this low figure and continued to recommend the system be deployed throughout the uk report pdf funding is now in place for the construction of the national anpr data centre capable of holding 50 million anpr reads per day destined to form the basis of a vehicle movement database 13 there have been sensationalist stories in the national press suggesting that the use of the network could be extended to catch drivers using mobile phones illegally and those failing to wear seat belts 14 since the current system only retains simple text strings consisting of number date amp time and not the actual images a huge increase in data transmission speeds and storage space would be required leaving aside the problem of creating computer software capable of recognising the presence of a phone or absence of a seat belt at motorway traffic speeds edit criticism speaking on 14 september 2008 simon davies the director of privacy international stated that the database would give police extraordinary powers of surveillance and claimed that this would never be allowed in any other democratic country 15 john catt an 80 year old pensioner at the time and his daughter linda with no criminal record between them were stopped in 2005 had their vehicle searched under section 44 of the terrorism act 2000 by city of london police and were threatened with arrest if they refused to answer police questions after making formal police complaints it was discovered they were stopped after their vehicle had been picked up by roadside anpr cctv cameras after a marker had been placed against their vehicle in the police national computer database as a result of them being spotted attending edo mbm demonstrations in brighton supporters of the catts highlight the fact that john and linda catt had been suspected of no crime and argue that they were unfairly targeted due to their associations 16 police spokesmen described the campaign catt had been taking part in as a campaign of illegality designed to pressurise edo to cease its lawful business which led to a series of convictions of campaigners and argued that surveillance of catt was necessary because his voluntary association at the smash edo protests forms part of a far wider picture of information which it is necessary for the police to continue to monitor in order to plan to maintain the peace minimise the risks of criminal offending and adequately to detect and prosecute offenders 17 sussex police refused to confirm or deny whether a tag exists on their car as of february 2012 john catt did not have a criminal record catt commented that our participation in peaceful protest outside an arms factory led to our arbitrary stop check for terrorist activities many miles away by another force is a very disturbing development of the police state 18 the register has noted that in theory a system could be organised in such a way that records of law abiding drivers weren t generated at all but that hasn t been the way things have panned out 19 in the united states the misuse of anpr has led to car confiscations 20 for crimes such as frequenting a bawdy place richard diamond commented that now it s a constitutional nightmare mocking fundamental and cherished legal protections the right to be presumed innocent the right to a trial by jury the right not to have excessive fines imposed the right not to be searched or have your property seized without reason or warrant and the right to due process 20 edit see also mass surveillance privacy civil liberties edit references a b c d e f g h i j connor
