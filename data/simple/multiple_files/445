been suggested that this article or section be merged with negative predictive value discuss proposed since may 2012 in statistics and diagnostic testing the positive predictive value or precision rate is the proportion of positive test results that are true positives such as correct diagnoses it is a critical measure of the performance of a diagnostic method as it reflects the probability that a positive test reflects the underlying condition being tested for its value does however depend on the prevalence of the outcome of interest which may be unknown for a particular target population the ppv can be derived using bayes theorem although sometimes used synonymously a positive predictive value generally refers to what is established by control groups while a post test probability rather refers to a probability for an individual still if the individual s pre test probability of the target condition is the same as the prevalence in the control group used to establish the positive predictive value the two are numerically equal contents 1 definition 2 worked example 3 problems with positive predictive value 3 1 other individual factors 3 2 different target conditions 4 see also 5 references and notes edit definition the positive predictive value is defined as where a true positive is the event that the test makes a positive prediction and the subject has a positive result under the gold standard and a false positive is the event that the test makes a positive prediction and the subject has a negative result under the gold standard the following diagram illustrates how the positive predictive value negative predictive value sensitivity and specificity are related condition as determined by gold standard condition positive condition negative test

true negative negative predictive value true negative 160 test 160 outcome 160 negative sensitivity true positive 160 condition 160 positive specificity true negative 160 condition 160 negative note that the positive and negative predictive values can only be estimated using data from a cross sectional study or other population based study in which valid prevalence estimates may be obtained in contrast the sensitivity and specificity can be estimated from case control studies if the prevalence sensitivity and specificity are known the positive predictive value can be obtained from the following identity edit worked example suppose the fecal occult blood fob screen test is used in 2030 people to look for bowel cancer patients with bowel cancer as confirmed on endoscopy condition

value ppv 160 160 10 indicates that many of the positive results from this testing procedure are false positives thus it will be necessary to follow up any positive result with a more reliable test to obtain a more accurate assessment as to whether cancer is present nevertheless such a test may be useful if it is inexpensive and convenient the strength of the fob screen test is instead in its negative predictive value which if negative for an individual gives us a high confidence that its negative result is true edit problems with positive predictive value edit other individual factors note that the ppv is not intrinsic to the test it depends also on the prevalence 1 due to the large effect of prevalence upon predictive values a standardized approach has been proposed where the ppv is normalized to a prevalence of 50 2 ppv is directly proportional to the prevalence of the disease or condition in the above example if the group of people tested had included a higher proportion of people with bowel cancer then the ppv would probably come out higher and the npv lower if everybody in the group had bowel cancer the ppv would be 100 and the npv 0 to overcome this problem npv and ppv should only be used if the ratio of the number of patients in the disease group and the number of patients in the healthy control group used to establish the npv and ppv is equivalent to the prevalence of the diseases in the studied population or in case two disease groups are compared if the ratio of the number of patients in disease group 1 and the number of patients in disease group 2 is equivalent to the ratio of the prevalences of the two diseases studied otherwise positive and negative likelihood ratios are more accurate than npv and ppv because likelihood ratios do not depend on prevalence when an individual being tested has a different pre test probability of having a condition than the control groups used to establish the ppv and npv the ppv and npv are generally distinguished from the positive and negative post test probabilities with the ppv and npv referring to the ones established by the control groups and the post test probabilities referring to the ones for the tested individual as estimated for example by likelihood ratios preferably in such cases a large group of equivalent individuals should be studied in order to establish separate positive and negative predictive values for use of the test in such individuals edit different target conditions ppv is used to indicate the probability that in case of a positive test that the patient really has the specified disease however there may be more than one cause for a disease and any single potential cause may not always result in the overt disease seen in a patient there is potential to mixup related target conditions of ppv and npv such as interpreting the ppv or npv of a test as having a disease when that ppv or npv value actually refers only to a predisposition of having that disease an example is the microbiological throat swab used in patients with a sore throat usually publications stating ppv of a throat swab are reporting on the probability that this bacteria is present in the throat rather than that the patient is ill from the bacteria found if presence of this bacteria always resulted in a sore throat then the ppv would be very useful however the bacteria may colonise individuals in a harmless way and never result in infection or disease sore throats occurring in these individuals is caused by other agents such as a virus in this situation the gold standard used in the evaluation study represents only the presence of bacteria that might be harmless but not a causal bacterial sore throat illness it can be proven that this problem will affect positive predictive value far more than negative predictive value to evaluate diagnostic tests where the gold standard looks only at potential causes of disease one may use an extension of the predictive value termed the etiologic predictive value 3 edit see also binary classification sensitivity and specificity negative predictive value false discovery rate relevance information retrieval receiver operator
