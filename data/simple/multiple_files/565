supreme court was organized on february 2 1790 4 edit earliest beginnings to marshall main article marshall court under chief justices jay rutledge and ellsworth 1789 1801 the court heard few cases its first decision was west v barnes 1791 a case involving a procedural issue 5 the court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige 6 a situation not helped by the highest profile case of the era chisholm v georgia which was immediately repudiated by the eleventh amendment the court s power and prestige waxed during the marshall court 1801 1835 7 under marshall the court established the principle of judicial review including specifying itself as the supreme expositor of the constitution marbury v madison 8 9 and made several important constitutional rulings giving shape and substance to the balance of power between the federal government and the states prominently martin v hunter s lessee mcculloch v maryland and gibbons v ogden 10 11 12 13 the marshall court also ended the practice of each justice issuing his opinion seriatim 14 a remnant of british tradition 15 and instead issuing a single majority opinion 14 also during marshall s tenure although beyond the court s control the impeachment and acquittal of justice samuel chase in 1804 1805 helped cement the principle of judicial independence 16 17 edit from taney to taft the taney court 1836 1864 made several important rulings such as sheldon v sill which held that while congress may not limit the subjects the supreme court may hear it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects 18 nevertheless it is primarily remembered for its ruling in dred scott v sandford 19 which may have helped precipitate the civil war 20 in the reconstruction era the chase waite and fuller courts 1864 1910 interpreted the new civil war amendments to the constitution 13 and developed the doctrine of substantive due process lochner v new york 21 adair v united states 22 under the white and taft courts 1910 1930 the court held that the fourteenth amendment had incorporated some guarantees of the bill of rights against the states gitlow v new york 23 grappled with the new antitrust statutes standard oil co of new jersey v united states upheld the constitutionality of military conscription selective draft law cases 24 and brought the substantive due process doctrine to its first apogee adkins v children s hospital 25 edit the new deal era during the hughes stone and vinson courts 1930 1953 the court gained its own accommodation in 1935 26 and changed its interpretation of the constitution giving a broader reading to the powers of the federal government to facilitate president franklin roosevelt s new deal most prominently west coast hotel co v parrish wickard v filburn united states v darby and united states v butler 27 28 29 during world war ii the court continued to favor government power upholding the internment of japanese citizens korematsu v united states and the mandatory pledge of allegiance minersville school district v gobitis nevertheless gobitis was soon repudiated west virginia state board of education v barnette and the steel seizure case restricted the pro government trend edit warren and burger main article warren court the warren court 1953 1969 dramatically expanded the force of constitutional civil liberties 30 it held that segregation in public schools violates equal protection brown v board of education bolling v sharpe and green v county school bd 31 and that traditional legislative district boundaries violated the right to vote reynolds v sims it created a general right to privacy griswold v connecticut 32 limited the role of religion in public school most prominently engel v vitale and abington school district v schempp 33 34 incorporated most guarantees of the bill of rights against the states prominently mapp v ohio the exclusionary rule and gideon v wainwright right to appointed counsel 35 36 and required that criminal suspects be apprised of all these rights by police miranda v arizona 37 at the same time however the court limited defamation suits by public figures new york times v sullivan and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust victories 38 the burger court 1969 1986 expanded griswold s right to privacy to strike down abortion laws roe v wade 39 but divided deeply on affirmative action regents of the university of california v bakke 40 and campaign finance regulation buckley v valeo 41 and dithered on the death penalty ruling first that most applications were defective furman v georgia 42 then that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional gregg v georgia 42 43 44 edit rehnquist and roberts main article roberts court the rehnquist court 1986 2005 was noted for its revival of judicial enforcement of federalism 45 emphasizing the limits of the constitution s affirmative grants of power united states v lopez and the force of its restrictions on those powers seminole tribe v florida city of boerne v flores 46 47 48 49 50 it struck down single sex state schools as a violation of equal protection united states v virginia laws against sodomy as violations of substantive due process lawrence v texas 51 and the line item veto clinton v new york but upheld school vouchers zelman v simmons harris and reaffirmed roe s restrictions on abortion laws planned parenthood v casey 52 the court s decision in bush v gore which ended the electoral recount during the presidential election of 2000 was controversial 53 54 the roberts court 2005 present is regarded by some as more conservative than the rehnquist court 55 56 some of its major rulings have concerned federal preemption wyeth v levine civil procedure twombly iqbal abortion gonzales v carhart 57 and the bill of rights prominently citizens united v federal election commission first amendment 58 heller mcdonald second amendment 59 and baze v rees eighth amendment 60 61 edit composition edit size of the court article iii of the united states constitution leaves it to congress to fix the number of justices the judiciary act of 1789 called for the appointment of six justices and as the nation s boundaries grew congress added justices to correspond with the growing number of judicial circuits seven in 1807 nine in 1837 and ten in 1863 in 1866 at the behest of chief justice chase congress passed an act providing that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced which would thin the bench to seven justices by attrition consequently one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867 in 1869 however the circuit judges act returned the number of justices to nine 62 where it has since remained president franklin d roosevelt attempted to expand the court in 1937 his proposal envisioned appointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 160 years 6 160 months and refused retirement up to a maximum bench of 15 justices the proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on elderly judges but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to pack the court with justices who would support roosevelt s new deal 63 the plan usually called the court packing plan failed in congress 64 nevertheless the court s balance began to shift within months when justice van devanter retired and was replaced by senator hugo black by the end of 1941 roosevelt had appointed seven justices and elevated harlan fiske stone to chief justice 65 edit appointment and confirmation main article appointment and confirmation to the supreme court of the united states the president of the united states appoints justices by and with the advice and consent of the senate 66 most presidents nominate candidates who broadly share their ideological views although a justice s decisions may end up being contrary to a president s expectations because the constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice a president may nominate anyone to serve subject to senate confirmation the roberts court october 2010 back row left to right sonia sotomayor stephen g breyer samuel a alito and elena kagan front row left to right clarence thomas antonin scalia chief justice john roberts anthony kennedy and ruth bader ginsburg in modern times the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group s views the senate judiciary committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full senate with a positive negative or neutral report the committee s practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent the first nominee to appear before the committee was harlan fiske stone in 1925 who sought to quell concerns about his links to wall street and the modern practice of questioning began with john marshall harlan ii in 1955 67 once the committee reports out the nomination the full senate considers it rejections are relatively uncommon the senate has explicitly rejected twelve supreme court nominees most recently robert bork in 1987 nevertheless not every nominee has received a floor vote in the senate although senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative vote in committee to block a nomination a nominee may be filibustered once debate has begun in the full senate no nomination for associate justice has ever been filibustered but president lyndon johnson s nomination of sitting associate justice abe fortas to succeed earl warren as chief justice was successfully filibustered in 1968 a president may also withdraw a nominee s name before the actual confirmation vote occurs typically because it is clear that the senate will reject them most recently harriet miers in 2006 once the senate confirms a nomination the president must prepare and sign a commission to which the seal of the department of justice must be affixed before the new justice can take office 68 the seniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date not the confirmation or swearing in date 69 before 1981 the approval process of justices was usually rapid from the truman through nixon administrations justices were typically approved within one month from the reagan administration to the present however the process has taken much longer some believe this is because congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past 70 edit recess appointments when the senate is in recess a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies recess appointees hold office only until the end of the next senate session at most less than two years the senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving of the two chief justices and six associate justices who have received recess appointments only chief justice john rutledge was not subsequently confirmed no president since dwight d eisenhower has made a recess appointment to the court and the practice has become rare and controversial even in lower federal courts 71 in 1960 after eisenhower had made three such appointments the senate passed a sense of the senate resolution that recess appointments to the court should only be made in unusual circumstances 72 such resolutions are not legally binding but are an expression of congress s views in the hope of guiding executive action 72 73 edit tenure the constitution provides that justices shall hold their offices during good behavior unless appointed during a senate recess the term good behavior is understood to mean justices may serve for the remainder of their lives unless they are impeached and convicted by congress resign or retire 74 only one justice has been impeached by the house of representatives samuel chase march 1804 but he was acquitted in the senate march 1805 75 moves to impeach sitting justices have occurred more recently for example william o douglas was the subject of hearings twice once in 1953 and again in 1970 but they did not reach a vote in the house no mechanism exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury both unable to resign and unable to resume service 76 because justices have indefinite tenure timing of vacancies can be unpredictable sometimes vacancies arise in quick succession as in the early 1970s when lewis franklin powell jr and william rehnquist were nominated to replace hugo black and john marshall harlan ii who retired within a week of each other sometimes a great length of time passes between nominations such as the eleven years between stephen breyer s nomination in 1994 and the nomination of john roberts in 2005 to fill the seat of sandra day o connor though roberts nomination was withdrawn and resubmitted for the role of chief justice after rehnquist died despite the variability all but four presidents have been able to appoint at least one justice william henry harrison died a month after taking office though his successor john tyler made an appointment during that presidential term zachary taylor likewise died early in his term although his successor millard fillmore also made a supreme court nomination before the end of that term andrew johnson who succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of abraham lincoln was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a contraction in the size of the court jimmy carter is the only president who completed at least one full term in office without making a nomination to the court during his presidency three presidents have appointed justices who collectively served more than 100 years franklin

1995 associate professor university of chicago law school 1991 1995 edit court demographics main article demographics of the supreme court of the united states the court currently has six male and three female justices one justice is african american one is latino and two are italian americans six justices are roman catholics and three are jewish the average age is 67 years 160 2 months and every current justice has an ivy league background 78 four justices are from the state of new york two from new jersey two from california and one from georgia in the 19th century every justice was a caucasian male and concerns about diversity focused on geography to represent all regions of the country rather than ethnic religious or gender diversity 79 thurgood marshall became the first african american justice in 1967 and sandra day o connor became the first female justice in 1981 o connor whose appointment fulfilled ronald reagan s campaign promise to place a woman on the court was later joined by ruth bader ginsburg appointed by bill clinton in 1993 marshall was succeeded by clarence thomas in 1991 who is the second african american to serve on the supreme court after o connor had in 2006 been succeeded by samuel alito ginsburg was in 2009 joined by sonia sotomayor the first latino justice and in 2010 by elena kagan so that there were three female justices most justices have been protestants including thirty five episcopalians nineteen presbyterians ten unitarians five methodists and three baptists 80 81 the first catholic justice was roger taney in 1836 and 1916 saw the appointment of the first jewish justice louis brandeis in recent years this situation has reversed after the retirement of justice stevens in june 2010 the court is without a protestant for the first time in its history 82 edit retired justices there are currently three living retired justices of the supreme court of the united states john paul stevens sandra day o connor and david souter as retired justices they no longer participate in the work of the supreme court but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts usually the united states courts of appeals such assignments are formally made by the chief justice on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice in recent years justice o connor has sat with several courts of appeals around the country and justice souter has frequently sat on the first circuit the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the supreme court the status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district judge who has taken senior status and eligibility of a supreme court justice to assume retired status rather than simply resign from the bench is governed by the same age and service criteria justices sometimes strategically plan their decisions to leave the bench with personal institutional and partisan factors playing a role 83 84 the fear of mental decline and death often motivates justices to step down the desire to maximize the court s strength and legitimacy through one retirement at a time when the court is in recess and during non presidential election years suggests a concern for institutional health finally especially in recent decades many justices have timed their departure to coincide with a compatible president holding office to ensure that a like minded successor would be appointed 85 86 name born appt by retired under conf vote age at appt first day date of retirement john paul stevens 01920 04 20 april 20

90 9 51 01990 10 09 october 9 1990 june 29 2009 edit seniority and seating many of the internal operations of the court are organized by the seniority of the justices the chief justice is considered the most senior member of the court regardless of the length of his or her service the associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service during court sessions the justices sit according to seniority with the chief justice in the center and the associate justices on alternating sides with the most senior associate justice on the chief justice s immediate right and the most junior associate justice seated on the left farthest away from the chief justice therefore the current court sits as follows from left to right when looking at the bench from the perspective of a lawyer arguing before the court sotomayor breyer thomas scalia most senior associate justice roberts chief justice kennedy ginsburg alito and kagan in the official yearly court photograph justices are arranged similarly with the five most senior members sitting in the front row in the same order as they would sit during court sessions thomas scalia roberts kennedy ginsburg and the four most junior justices standing behind them again in the same order as they would sit during court sessions sotomayor breyer alito kagan in the justices private conferences the current practice is for them to speak and vote in order of seniority from the chief justice first to the most junior associate justice last the most junior associate justice in these conferences is tasked with any menial labor the justices may require as they convene alone such as answering the door of their conference room serving coffee and transmitting the orders of the court to the court s clerk 87 justice joseph story served the longest as the junior justice from february 3 1812 to september 1 1823 for a total of 4 228 days justice stephen breyer follows close behind with 4 199 days when samuel alito joined the court on january 31 2006 88 edit salary for the years 2009 and 2010 associate justices were paid 213 900 and the chief justice 223 500 89 article iii section 1 of the u s constitution prohibits congress from reducing the pay for incumbent justices once a justice meets age and service requirements the justice may retire judicial pensions are based on the normal formula for federal employees but a justice s pension will never be less than their salary at time of retirement the same procedure applies to judges of other federal courts edit judicial leanings see also ideological leanings of u s supreme court justices while justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from political parties as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches jurists are informally categorized in legal and political circles as being judicial conservatives moderates or liberals such leanings however generally refer to legal outlook rather than a political or legislative one as of the october 2012 term the court consists of five justices appointed by republican presidents and four appointed by democratic presidents it is popularly accepted that chief justice roberts and justices scalia thomas and alito appointed by republican presidents comprise the court s conservative wing justices ginsburg breyer sotomayor and kagan appointed by democratic presidents comprise the court s liberal wing justice kennedy appointed by president reagan is generally considered a conservative who has occasionally voted with liberals 90 and is often the swing vote that determines the outcome of close cases 91 92 93 tom goldstein argued in an article in scotusblog in 2010 that the popular view of the supreme court as sharply divided along ideological lines and each side pushing an agenda at every turn is in significant part a caricature designed to fit certain preconceptions 94 he points out that in the 2009 term almost half the cases were decided unanimously and only about 20 were decided by a 5 to 4 vote barely one in ten cases involved the narrow liberal conservative divide fewer if the cases where sotomayor recused herself are not included he also pointed to several cases that defy the popular conception of the ideological lines of the court 95 goldstein further argued that the large number of pro criminal defendant summary dismissals usually cases where the justices decide that the lower courts significantly misapplied precedent and reverse the case without briefing or argument are an illustration that the conservative justices have not been aggressively ideological likewise goldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of congress show inadequate deference to the political process and be disrespectful of precedent also lacks merit thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent even if long standing that he views as having been wrongly decided and during the 2009 term scalia and thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation according to statistics compiled by scotusblog in the twelve terms from 2000 to 2011 an average of 19 of the opinions on major issues 22 were decided by a 5 4 vote with an average of 70 of those split opinions decided by a court divided along the traditionally perceived ideological lines about 15 of all opinions issued over that period the conservative bloc has been in the majority about 62 of the time that the court has divided along ideological lines which represents about 44 of all the 5 4 decisions 96 in the october 2010 term the court decided 86 cases including 75 signed opinions and 5 summary reversals where the court reverses a lower court without arguments and without issuing an opinion on the case 97 98 four were decided with unsigned opinions two cases affirmed by an equally divided court and two cases were dismissed as improvidently granted justice kagan recused herself from 26 of the cases due to her prior role as united states solicitor general of the 80 cases 38 about 48 the highest percentage since the october 2005 term were decided unanimously 9 0 or 8 0 and only 16 decisions were made by a 5 4 vote about 20 compared to 18 in the october 2009 term and 29 in the october 2008 term 99 however in fourteen of the sixteen 5 4 decisions the court divided along the traditional ideological lines with ginsburg breyer sotomayor and kagan on the liberal side and roberts scalia thomas and alito on the conservative and kennedy providing the swing vote this represents 87 of those 16 cases the highest rate in the past 10 years the conservative bloc joined by kennedy formed the majority in 63 of the 5 4 decisions the highest cohesion rate of that bloc in the roberts court 97 100 101 102 103 in the october 2011 term the court decided 75 cases of these 33 about 44 were decided unanimously and 15 about 20 the same percentage as in the previous term were decided by a vote of 5 4 of the latter 15 the court divided along the perceived ideological lines 10 times with justice kennedy siding with the conservative justices roberts scalia thomas and alito five times and with the liberal justices ginsburg breyer sotomayor and kagan five times 96 104 105 edit politicization of the court clerks hired by each of the justices of the supreme court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft supreme court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of vanderbilt university law school 106 107 as law has moved closer to mere politics political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts former federal court of appeals judge j michael luttig said 106 david j garrow professor of history at the university of cambridge stated that the court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government we are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the house of representatives professor garrow said each side is putting forward only ideological purists 106 according to the vanderbilt law review study this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the supreme court is a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law 106 a poll conducted in june 2012 by the new york times and cbs news showed that just 44 percent of americans approve of the job the supreme court is doing three quarters said the justices decisions are sometimes influenced by their political or personal views 108 edit facilities the present u s supreme court building seen from across 1st street se from the 1860s until the 1930s the court sat in the old senate chamber of the u s capitol main article united states supreme court building the supreme court first met on february 1 1790 at the merchants exchange building in new york city when philadelphia became the capital the court met briefly in independence hall before settling in old city hall from 1791 until 1800 after the government moved to washington d c the court occupied various spaces in the united states capitol building until 1935 when it moved into its own purpose built home the four story building was designed by cass gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the capitol and library of congress and is clad in marble the building includes the courtroom justices chambers an extensive law library various meeting spaces and auxiliary services including a gymnasium the supreme court building is within the ambit of the architect of the capitol but maintains its own police force separate from the capitol police 109 located across the street from the united states capitol at one first street ne and maryland avenue 110 111 the building is open to the public from 9 160 am to 4 30 160 pm weekdays but closed on weekends and holidays 110 visitors may not tour the actual courtroom unaccompanied there is a cafeteria a gift shop

through late april with breaks during december and february visitors are seated on a first come first served basis one estimate is there are about 250 seats available 112 the number of open seats varies from case to case for important cases some visitors arrive the day before and wait through the night from mid may until the end of june the court releases orders and opinions beginning at 10 160 am and these 15 to 30 minute sessions are open to the public on a similar basis 109 supreme court police are available to answer questions 110 edit jurisdiction inscription on the wall of the supreme court building from marbury v madison in which chief justice john marshall outlined the concept of judicial review main article procedures of the supreme court of the united states section 2 of article three of the united states constitution outlines the jurisdiction of the federal courts of the united states the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution the laws of the united states and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority to all cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and consuls to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to controversies to which the united states shall be a party to controversies between two or more states between a state and citizens of another state between citizens of different states between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states and between a state or the citizens thereof and foreign states citizens or subjects the jurisdiction of the federal courts was further limited by the eleventh amendment to the united states constitution which forbade federal courts from hearing cases commenced or prosecuted against a state by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state however states may waive this immunity and congress may abrogate the states immunity in certain circumstances see sovereign immunity in addition to constitutional constraints congress is authorized by article iii to regulate the court s appellate jurisdiction for example the federal courts may hear cases only if one or more of the following conditions are met if there is diversity of citizenship meaning the parties are citizens of different states or countries including foreign states 113 and the amount of damages exceeds 75 000 114 if the case presents a federal question meaning that it involves a claim or issue arising under the constitution laws or treaties of the united states 115 if the united states federal government including the post office 116 is a party in the case 117 118 exercise of this power can become controversial see jurisdiction stripping for example 28 u s c 160 160 2241 e 1 as amended by the detainee treatment act provides that no court justice or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the united states who has been determined by the united states to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination the constitution specifies that the supreme court may exercise original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors and other diplomats and in cases in which a state is a party in all other cases however the court has only appellate jurisdiction it considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely almost all cases are brought to the supreme court on appeal in practice the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the court are disputes between two or more states the power of the supreme court to consider appeals from state courts rather than just federal courts was created by the judiciary act of 1789 and upheld early in the court s history by its rulings in martin v hunter s lessee 1816 and cohens v virginia 1821 the supreme court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions although there are several devices that permit so called collateral review of state cases since article three of the united states constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain cases or controversies the supreme court avoids deciding cases that are moot and does not render advisory opinions as the supreme courts of some states may do for example in defunis v odegaard 416 u s 312 1974 the court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit and a decision from the court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered the mootness exception is not absolute if an issue is capable of repetition yet evading review the court will address it even though the party before the court would not himself be made whole by a favorable result in roe v wade 410 u s 113 1973 and other abortion cases the court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the supreme court edit justices as circuit justices the united states is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals each of which is assigned a circuit justice from the supreme court although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic its meaning has changed through time under the judiciary act of 1789 each justice was required to ride circuit or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges this practice encountered opposition from many justices who cited the difficulty of travel moreover several individuals opposed it because a justice could not be expected to be impartial in an appeal if he had previously decided the same case while riding circuit circuit riding was abolished in 1891 today the circuit justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing with certain types of applications that under the court s rules may be addressed by a single justice these include applications for emergency stays including stays of execution in death penalty cases and injunctions pursuant to the all writs act arising from cases within that circuit as well as routine requests such as requests for extensions of time in the past circuit justices also sometimes ruled on motions for bail in criminal cases writs of habeas corpus and applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal ordinarily a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it granted or denied or entering a standard form of order however the justice may elect to write an opinion referred to as an in chambers opinion in such matters if he or she wishes a circuit justice may sit as a judge on the court of appeals of that circuit but over the past hundred years this has rarely occurred a circuit justice sitting with the court of appeals has seniority over the chief judge of the circuit the chief justice has traditionally been assigned to the district of columbia circuit the fourth circuit which includes maryland and virginia the states surrounding the district of columbia and since it was established the federal circuit each associate justice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits as of september 28 2010 the allotment of the justices among the circuits is 119 circuit justice district of columbia circuit chief justice roberts first circuit justice breyer second circuit justice ginsburg third circuit justice alito fourth circuit chief justice roberts fifth circuit justice scalia sixth circuit justice kagan seventh circuit justice kagan eighth circuit justice alito ninth circuit justice kennedy tenth circuit justice sotomayor eleventh circuit justice thomas federal circuit chief justice roberts four of the current justices are assigned to circuits on which they previously sat as circuit judges chief justice roberts d c circuit justice breyer first circuit justice alito third circuit and justice kennedy ninth circuit edit process main article procedures of the supreme court of the united states a term of the supreme court commences on the first monday of each october and continues until june or early july of the following year each term consists of alternating periods of approximately two weeks known as sittings and recesses justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings they discuss cases and write opinions during recesses edit case selection nearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of certiorari commonly referred to as cert the court may review any case in the federal courts of appeals by writ of certiorari granted upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case 120 the court may only review final judgments rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had if those judgments involve a question of federal statutory or constitutional law 121 the party that lost in the lower court is the petitioner and the party that prevailed is the respondent all case names before the court are styled petitioner v respondent regardless of which party initiated the lawsuit in the trial court for example criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state and against an individual as in state of arizona v ernesto miranda if the defendant is convicted and his conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the state supreme court when he petitions for cert the name of the case becomes miranda v arizona there are situations where the court has original jurisdiction such as when two states have a dispute against each other or when there is a dispute between the united states and a state in such instances a case is filed with the supreme court directly examples of such cases include united states v texas a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the united states or to texas and virginia v tennessee a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires congressional approval although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of georgia v brailsford 122 parties in an action at law in which the supreme court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact 123 two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in new jersey v delaware and water rights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in kansas v colorado the common shorthand name for cases is typically the first party the petitioner for example brown v board of education is referred to simply as brown and roe v wade as roe the exception to this rule is when the name of a state or the united states or some government entity is the first listed party in that instance the name of the second party is the shorthand name for example iowa v tovar is referred to simply as tovar and gonzales v raich is referred to simply as raich because the first party alberto gonzales was sued in his official capacity as the united states attorney general a cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called a conference a conference is a private meeting of the nine justices by themselves the public and the justices clerks are excluded if four justices vote to grant the petition the case proceeds to the briefing stage otherwise the case ends except in death penalty cases and other cases in which the court orders briefing from the respondent the respondent may but is not required to file a response to the cert petition the court grants a petition for cert only for compelling reasons spelled out in the court s rule 10 such reasons include resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or a provision of the federal constitution correcting an egregious departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings resolving an important question of federal law or to expressly review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a previous decision of the court when a conflict of interpretations arises from differing interpretations of the same law or constitutional provision issued by different federal circuit courts of appeals lawyers call this situation a circuit split if the court votes to deny a cert petition as it does in the vast majority of such petitions that come before it it does so typically without comment a denial of a cert petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case and the decision of the lower court stands as the final ruling in the case to manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the court each year of the more than 7 000 petitions the court receives each year it will usually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer the court employs an internal case management tool known as the cert pool currently all justices except for justice alito participate in the cert pool 124 125 126 edit oral argument when the court grants a cert petition the case is set for oral argument both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition with the consent of the parties or approval of the court amici curiae or friends of the court may also file briefs the court holds two week oral argument sessions each month from october through april each side has thirty minutes to present its argument the court may choose to give more time though this is rare 127 and during that time the justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions the petitioner gives the first presentation and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent s arguments after the respondent has concluded amici curiae may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees the court advises counsel to assume that the justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case edit decision at the conclusion of oral argument the case is submitted for decision cases are decided by majority vote of the justices it is the court s practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular term by the end of that term within that term however the court is under no obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral argument at the conclusion of oral argument the justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied and the most senior justice in the majority assigns the initial draft of the court s opinion to a justice on his or her side drafts of the court s opinion as well as any concurring or dissenting opinions 128 circulate among the justices until the court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case it is possible that through recusals or vacancies the court divides evenly on a case if that occurs then the decision of the court below is affirmed but does not establish binding precedent in effect it results in a return to the status quo ante for a case to be heard there must be a quorum of at least six justices 129 if a quorum is not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the court had been evenly divided for cases brought directly to the supreme court by direct appeal from a united states district court the chief justice may order the case remanded to the appropriate u s court of appeals for a final decision there 130 this has only occurred once in u s history in the case of united states v alcoa 131 edit published opinions the court s opinions are published in three stages first a slip opinion is made available on the court s web site and through other outlets next several opinions are bound together in paperback form called a preliminary print of united states reports the official series of books in which the final version of the court s opinions appears about a year after the preliminary prints are issued a final bound volume of u s reports is issued the individual volumes of u s reports are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily as of march 2012 ref there are 566 volumes of u s reports lawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases in the form vvv u s ppp yyyy the number before the u s refers to the volume number and the number after the u s refers to the page within that volume the number in parentheses is the year in which the case was decided for instance the citation for roe v wade is 410 u s 113 1973 and it means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410 of u s reports for hot from the press judgments the volume and page numbers are replaced with as of march 2012 update the u s reports have published a total of 30 161 supreme court opinions covering the decisions handed down from february 1790 to march 2012 this figure does not reflect the number of cases the court has taken up as several cases can be addressed by a single opinion see for example parents v seattle where meredith v jefferson county board of education was also decided in the same opinion a more unusual example is the telephone cases which comprise a single opinion that takes up the entire 126th volume of the u s reports opinions are also collected and published in two unofficial parallel reporters supreme court reporter published by west now a part of thomson reuters and united states supreme court reports lawyers edition simply known as lawyers edition published by lexisnexis in court documents legal periodicals and other legal media case citations generally contain the cites from each of the three reporters for example the citation to citizens united v federal election commission is presented as citizens united v federal election com n 585 u s 50 130 s ct 876 175 l ed 2d 753 2010 with s ct representing the supreme court reporter and l ed representing the lawyers edition 132 133 edit institutional powers and constraints the constitution does not explicitly grant the supreme court the power of judicial review nevertheless the power of this court to overturn laws and executive actions it deems unlawful or unconstitutional is a well established precedent many of the founding fathers accepted the notion of judicial review in federalist no 78 alexander hamilton wrote a constitution is in fact and must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law it therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body if there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two that which has the superior obligation and validity ought of course to be preferred or in other words the constitution ought to be preferred to the statute the supreme court first established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in marbury v madison 1803 consummating the system of checks and balances this power allows judges to have the last word on allocation of authority among the three branches of the federal government which grants them the ability to set bounds to their own authority as well as to their immunity from outside checks and balances the supreme court cannot directly enforce its rulings instead it relies on respect for the constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments one notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832 when the state of georgia ignored the supreme court s decision in worcester v georgia president andrew jackson who sided with the georgia courts is supposed to have remarked john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it 134 however this alleged quotation has been disputed some state governments in the south also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment brown v board of education more recently many feared that president nixon would refuse to comply with the court s order in united states v nixon 1974 to surrender the watergate tapes nixon however ultimately complied with the supreme court s ruling some argue that the supreme court is the most separated and least checked of all branches of government 135 justices are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure during good behavior and their pay may not be diminished while they hold their position section 1 of article three though subject to the process of impeachment only one justice has ever been impeached and no supreme court justice has been removed from office supreme court decisions have been purposefully overridden by constitutional amendment in only four instances the eleventh amendment overturned chisholm v georgia 1793 the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments in effect overturned dred scott v sandford 1857 the sixteenth amendment reversed pollock v farmers loan and trust co 1895 and the twenty sixth amendment overturned some portions of oregon v mitchell 1970 however when the court rules on matters involving the interpretation of laws rather than of the constitution simple legislative action can reverse the decisions for example in 2009 congress passed the lilly ledbetter act superseding the limitations given in ledbetter v goodyear tire amp rubber co in 2007 also the supreme court is not immune from political and institutional restraints lower federal courts and state courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations as do law enforcement officials 136 in addition the other two branches can restrain the court through other mechanisms congress can increase the number of justices giving the president power to influence future decisions by appointments as in roosevelt s court packing plan discussed above congress can pass legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the supreme court and other federal courts over certain topics and cases this is suggested by language in section 2 of article three where the appellate jurisdiction is granted with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make the court sanctioned such congressional action in the reconstruction case ex parte mccardle 1869 though it rejected congress power to dictate how particular cases must be decided in united states v klein 1871 on the other hand through its power of judicial review the supreme court has defined the scope and nature of the powers and separation between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government for example in united states v curtiss wright export corp 1936 dames amp moore v regan 1981 and notably in goldwater v carter 1979 where it effectively gave the presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of congress or the senate the court s decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of executive authority as in humphrey s executor v united states 1935 the steel seizure case 1952 and united states v nixon 1974 edit criticism some criticisms leveled at the supreme court are judicial activism the supreme court has been criticized for not keeping within constitutional bounds by engaging in judicial activism rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology 137 an often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in lochner v new york which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers including robert bork justice antonin scalia and chief justice john roberts 137 138 an often cited example of liberal judicial activism is roe v wade 1973 which legalized abortion in part on the basis of the right to privacy expressed in the fourteenth amendment a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous 137 legal scholars 139 140 justices 141 and presidential candidates 142 have criticized the roe decision the progressive brown v board of education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as patrick buchanan 143 and former presidential contender barry goldwater 144 lincoln warned referring to the dred scott decision that if government policy became irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court the people will have ceased to be their own rulers 145 former justice thurgood marshall justified judicial activism with these words you do what you think is right and let the law catch up 146 during different historical periods the court has leaned in different directions 147 148 critics from both sides complain that activist judges abandon the constitution and substitute their own views instead 149 150 151 critics include writers such as andrew napolitano 152 phyllis schlafly 153 mark r levin 154 mark i sutherland 155 and james macgregor burns 156 157 past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism including franklin roosevelt richard nixon and ronald reagan 158 159 failed supreme court nominee robert bork wrote what judges have wrought is a coup d tat slow moving and genteel but a coup d tat nonetheless 160 senator al franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than the politician would like 161 it has been argued that the supreme court is in some respects certainly a legislative body 162 federal versus state power there has been debate throughout american history about the boundary between federal and state power while framers such as james madison 163 and alexander hamilton 164 argued in the federalist papers that their then proposed constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments 165 166 167 168 others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the framers wishes 169 the supreme court has been criticized for giving the federal government too much power to interfere with state authority one criticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the commerce clause by upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce but that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce and by voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce for example the commerce clause was used by the fifth circuit court of appeals to uphold the endangered species act thus protecting six endemic species of insect near austin texas despite the fact that the insects had no commercial value and did not travel across state lines the supreme court let that ruling stand without comment in 2005 170 chief justice john marshall asserted congress s power over interstate commerce was complete in itself may be exercised to its utmost extent and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the constitution 171 justice alito said congressional authority under the commerce clause is quite broad 172 modern day theorist robert b reich suggests debate over the commerce clause continues today 171 advocates of states rights such as constitutional scholar kevin gutzman have also criticized the court saying it has misused the fourteenth amendment to undermine state authority justice brandeis in arguing for allowing the states to operate without federal interference suggested that states should be laboratories of democracy 173 one critic wrote the great majority of supreme court rulings of unconstitutionality involve state not federal law 174 however others see the fourteenth amendment as a positive force that extends protection of those rights and guarantees to the state level 175 judicial interference in political disputes some court decisions have been criticized for injecting the court into the political arena and deciding questions that are the purview of the other two branches of government the bush v gore decision in which the supreme court intervened in the 2000 presidential election and effectively chose george w bush over al gore has been criticized extensively particularly by liberals 176 177 178 179 180 181 another example are court decisions on apportionment and re districting in baker v carr the court decided it could rule on apportionment questions justice frankfurter in a scathing dissent argued against the court wading into so called political questions 182 failing to protect individual rights court decisions have been criticized for failing to protect individual rights the dred scott 1857 decision upheld slavery 183 plessy v ferguson 1896 upheld segregation under the doctrine of separate but equal 184 kelo v city of new london 2005 was criticized by prominent politicians including new jersey governor jon corzine as undermining property rights 185 186 a student criticized a 1988 ruling that allowed school officials to block publication of a student article in the high school newspaper 187 some critics suggest the 2009 bench with a conservative majority has become increasingly hostile to voters by siding with indiana s voter identification laws which tend to disenfranchise large numbers of people without driver s licenses especially poor and minority voters according to one report 188 senator al franken criticized the court for eroding individual rights 161 however others argue that the court is too protective of some individual rights particularly those of people accused of crimes or in detention for example chief justice warren burger was an outspoken critic of the exclusionary rule and justice scalia criticized the court s decision in boumediene v bush for being too protective of the rights of guantanamo detainees on the grounds that habeas corpus was limited to sovereign territory 189 supreme court has too much power this criticism is related to complaints about judicial activism george will wrote that the court has an increasingly central role in american governance 190 it was criticized for intervening in bankruptcy proceedings regarding ailing carmaker chrysler corporation in 2009 191 a reporter wrote that justice ruth bader ginsburg s intervention in the chrysler bankruptcy left open the possibility of further judicial review but argued overall that the intervention was a proper use of supreme court power to check the executive branch 191 warren e burger before becoming chief justice argued that since the supreme court has such unreviewable power it is likely to self indulge itself and unlikely to engage in dispassionate analysis 192 larry sabato wrote excessive authority has accrued to the federal courts especially the supreme court 193 courts are poor check on executive power british constitutional scholar adam tomkins sees flaws in the american system of having courts and specifically the supreme court act as checks on the executive and legislative branches he argues that because the courts must wait sometimes for years for cases to wend their way through the system their ability to restrain the other two branches is severely weakened 194 195 not choosing enough cases to review senator arlen specter said the court should decide more cases 161 on the other hand although justice scalia acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of cases that the court hears now is smaller today than when he first joined the supreme court he also stated that he has not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case nor does he believe his colleagues have changed their standards he attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s at least in part to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts 196 secretive proceedings the court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view 197 its inner workings are difficult for reporters to cover like a closed cartel only revealing itself through public events and printed releases with nothing about its inner workings according to a review of jeffrey toobin s expose the nine inside the secret world of the supreme court 180 the reviewer writes few reporters dig deeply into court affairs it all works very neatly the only ones hurt are the american people who know little about nine individuals with enormous power over their lives 180 larry sabato complains about the court s insularity 193 a fairleigh dickinson university poll conducted in 2010 found that 61 of american voters agreed that televising court hearings would be good for democracy and 50 of voters stated they would watch court proceedings if they were televised 198 199 in recent years many justices have appeared on television written books and made public statements to journalists 196 200 in a 2009 interview on c span journalists joan biskupic of usa today and lyle denniston of scotusblog argued that the court is a very open institution with only the justices private conferences being inaccessible to others 196 in october 2010 the court began the practice of posting on its website recordings and transcripts of oral arguments on the friday after they take place creating a culture of legal intimidation critic philip k howard in the death of common sense and life without lawyers criticized the court for promoting a culture in which law is wielded as a weapon of intimidation rather than as an instrument of protection 201 it leads to a nation paralyzed by fear unwilling to assume responsibility both overly reliant on authority and distrustful of it 201 howard deplores a legal culture in which the rights of whoever might disagree have trumped common sense 202 specifically howard criticized the earl warren court for too much sympathy for the little man 203 he criticized the conley v gibson decision for opening the floodgates to abusive litigation 204 lifetime tenure critic larry sabato wrote the insularity of lifetime tenure combined with the appointments of relatively young attorneys who give long service on the bench produces senior judges representing the views of past generations better than views of the current day 193 sanford levinson has been critical of justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity 205 james macgregor burns stated lifelong tenure has produced a critical time lag with the supreme court institutionally almost always behind the times 156 proposals to solve these problems include term limits for justices as proposed by levinson 206 and sabato 193 207 as well as a mandatory retirement age proposed by richard epstein 208 however others suggest lifetime tenure brings substantial benefits such as impartiality and freedom from political pressure alexander hamilton in federalist 78 wrote nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office 209 edit see also supreme court of the united states portal government of the united states portal law portal federal judicial appointment history
