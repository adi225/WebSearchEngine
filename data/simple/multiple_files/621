the wimm one an android powered wearable computer wearable computers also known as body borne computers are miniature electronic devices that are worn by the bearer under with or on top of clothing 1 this class of wearable technology has been developed for general or special purpose information technologies and media development wearable computers are especially useful for applications that require more complex computational support than just hardware coded logics one of the main features of a wearable computer is consistency there is a constant interaction between the computer and user i e there is no need to turn the device on or off another feature is the ability to multi task it is not necessary to stop what you are doing to use the device it is augmented into all other actions these devices can be incorporated by the user to act like a prosthetic it can therefore be an extension of the user s mind and or body many issues are common to the wearables as with mobile computing ambient intelligence and ubiquitous computing research communities including power management and heat dissipation software architectures wireless and personal area networks the international symposium on wearable computers is the longest running academic conference on the subject of wearable computers because wearable computing affects society so profoundly it is the central topic of the 2013 ieee international symposium on technology and society istas 2013 contents 1 areas of applications 2 history 2 1 1600s 2 2 1810 2 3 1880 2 4 1960s and 1970s 2 5 1980s 2 6 1990s 2 7 2000s 2 8

actively engaged as the physical environment wearable computer items have been initially developed for and applied with e g sensory integration e g to help people see better whether in task specific applications like camera based welding helmets 2 or for everyday use like computerized digital eyeglass or to help people understand the world better 1 behavioral modeling health care monitoring systems service management mobile phones smartphones electronic textiles fashion design and other usage also today still wearable computing is a topic of active research with areas of study including user interface design augmented reality pattern recognition the use of wearables for specific applications or for compensating disabilities as well as supporting elderly people steadily increases edit history evolution of steve mann s wearcomp wearable computer from backpack based systems of the late 1970s and early 1980s to his current covert systems the development of wearable items has taken several steps of miniaturization from discrete electronics over hybrid designs to fully integrated designs where just one processor chip a battery and some interface conditioning items make the whole unit depending on how broadly one defines both wearable and computer the first wearable computer could be as early as the first abacus on a string worn around the neck or later a 16th century abacus ring or perhaps the first wristwatch made by breguet for the queen of naples in 1810 or the covert timing devices hidden in shoes to cheat at roulette by thorp and shannon in the 1960s and 1970s however common understanding is that a computer as a user programmable item for complex algorithms interfacing and data management in this modern meaning of the word computer i e as a general purpose device upon which the wearer can choose to run various different applications while wearing it the wearable computer was invented by steve mann in the late 1970s steve mann a professor at the university of toronto was hailed as the father of the wearable computer and the isscc s first virtual panelist by moderator woodward yang of harvard university cambridge mass ieee isscc feb 8 2000 3 4 5 edit 1600s the qing dynasty saw the introduction of a fully functional abacus on a ring which could be used while it was being worn 1 6 if we interpret the words wearable computing separately this ring might be the first wearable computer since it is a computer and it is also wearable however a single task computer is not typically what we mean by computer in the modern sense of the word in which we expect a computer to be a general purpose device that can run a variety of user defined applications not just a calculator edit 1810 the first wearable timepiece was made by watchmaker breguet for the queen of naples in 1810 it was a small ladies pocket watch on a bracelet chain 7 again a wristwatch is a wearable computer in the sense that it can be worn and that it also computes time but it is not a general purpose computer in the sense of the modern word edit 1880 military use of wearables in girard perregaux made wristwatches for the german imperial navy after an artillery officer complained that it was not convenient to use both hands to operate a pocket watch while timing his bombardments the officer had strapped a pocket watch onto his wrist and his superiours liked his solution and thus asked la chaux de fonds to travel to berlin to begin production of small pocket watches attached to wrist bracelets 7 early acceptance of wristlets by men serving in the military was not widespread though wristlets as they were called were reserved for women and considered more of a passing fad than a serious timepiece in fact they were held in such disdain that many a gentlemen were actually quoted to say they would sooner wear a skirt as wear a wristwatch international watch magazine 8 edit 1960s and 1970s in 1961 mathematician edward o thorp and claude shannon built some computerized timing devices to help them cheat at roulette one such timer was concealed in a shoe another in a pack of cigarrettes various versions of this apparatus were built in the 1960s and 1970s detailed pictures of a shoe based timing device can be viewed at www eyetap org although the device used a 6502 microprocessor the same microprocessor used in many early computers it was not a computer in the modern sense of the word e g the user could not use it for various things its function was limited to telling time specifically to cheat at a game of roulette 1 thorp refers to himself as the inventor of the first wearable computer 9 in other variations the system was a concealed cigarette pack sized analog computer designed to predict roulette wheels a data taker would use microswitches hidden in his shoes to indicate the speed of the roulette wheel and the computer would indicate an octant to bet on by sending musical tones via radio to a miniature speaker hidden in a collaborators ear canal the system was successfully tested in las vegas in june 1961 but hardware issues with the speaker wires prevented them from using it beyond their test runs 10 this was not a wearable computer in the sense that it could not be programmed by the user during use i e it was an example of task specific hardware this work was kept secret until it was first mentioned in thorp s book beat the dealer revised ed in 1966 10 and later published in detail in 1969 11 the 1970s saw the rise of similar special purpose hardware timing devices etc such as the roulette prediction devices using next generation technology in particular a group known as eudaemonic enterprises that used a cmos 6502 microprocessor with 5k ram to create a shoe computer with inductive radio communications between a data taker and better 12 13 another early wearable system was a camera to tactile vest for the blind published by c c collins in 1977 that converted images into a 1024 point 10 inch square tactile grid on a vest 14 on the consumer end 1977 also saw the introduction of the hp 01 algebraic calculator watch by hewlett packard 15 edit 1980s the 1980s saw the rise of more general purpose wearable computers that fit the modern definition of computer by going beyond task specific hardware to more general purpose e g reprogrammable by the user devices in 1981 steve mann designed and built a backpack mounted 6502 based wearable multimedia computer with text graphics and multimedia capability as well as video capability cameras and other photographic systems mann went on to be an early and active researcher in the wearables field especially known for his 1994 creation of the wearable wireless webcam the first example of lifelogging 16 17 though perhaps not technically wearable in 1986 steve roberts built winnebiko ii a recumbent bicycle with on board computer and chorded keyboard winnebiko ii was the first of steve roberts forays into nomadic computing that allowed him to type while riding 18 datalink usb dress edition with invasion video game the watch crown icontrol can be used to move the defender left to right and the fire control is the start split button on the lower side of the face of the watch at 6 o clock in 1989 reflection technology marketed the private eye head mounted display which scanned a vertical array of leds across the visual field using a vibrating mirror this display gave rise to several hobbyist and research wearables including gerald chip maguire s ibm columbia university student electronic notebook 19 doug platt s hip pc and carnegie mellon university s vuman 1 in 1991 20 the student electronic notebook consisted of the private eye toshiba diskless aix notebook computers prototypes and a stylus based input system plus virtual keyboard and used direct sequence spread spectrum radio links to provide all the usual tcp ip based services including nfs mounted file systems and x11 all running in the andrew project environment the hip pc included an agenda palmtop used as a chording keyboard attached to the belt and a 1 44 megabyte floppy drive later versions incorporated additional equipment from park engineering the system debuted at the lap and palmtop expo on 16 april 1991 vuman 1 was developed as part of a summer term course at carnegie mellon s engineering design research center and was intended for viewing house blueprints input was through a three button unit worn on the belt and output was through reflection tech s private eye the cpu was an 8 160 mhz 80188 processor with 0 5 mb

october 2011 in 1993 the private eye was used in thad starner s wearable based on doug platt s system and built from a kit from park enterprises a private eye display on loan from devon sean mccullough and the twiddler chording keyboard made by handykey many iterations later this system became the mit tin lizzy wearable computer design and starner went on to become one of the founders of mit s wearable computing project 1993 also saw columbia university s augmented reality system known as karma knowledge based augmented reality for maintenance assistance users would wear a private eye display over one eye giving an overlay effect when the real world was viewed with both eyes open karma would overlay wireframe schematics and maintenance instructions on top of whatever was being repaired for example graphical wireframes on top of a laser printer would explain how to change the paper tray the system used sensors attached to objects in the physical world to determine their locations and the entire system ran tethered from a desktop computer 21 22 in 1994 edgar matias and mike ruicci of the university of toronto debuted a wrist computer their system presented an alternative approach to the emerging head up display plus chord keyboard wearable the system was built from a modified hp 95lx palmtop computer and a half qwerty one handed keyboard with the keyboard and display modules strapped to the operator s forearms text could be entered by bringing the wrists together and typing 23 the same technology was used by ibm researchers to create the half keyboard belt computer 24 also in 1994 mik lamming and mike flynn at xerox europarc demonstrated the forget me not a wearable device that would record interactions with people and devices and store this information in a database for later query 25 it interacted via wireless transmitters in rooms and with equipment in the area to remember who was there who was being talked to on the telephone and what objects were in the room allowing queries like who came by my office while i was on the phone to mark as with the toronto system forget me not was not based on a head mounted display also in 1994 darpa started the smart modules program to develop a modular humionic approach to wearable and carryable computers with the goal of producing a variety of products including computers radios navigation systems and human computer interfaces that have both military and commercial use in july 1996 darpa went on to host the wearables in 2005 workshop bringing together industrial university and military visionaries to work on the common theme of delivering computing to the individual 26 a follow up conference was hosted by boeing in august 1996 where plans were finalized to create a new academic conference on wearable computing in october 1997 carnegie mellon university mit and georgia tech co hosted the ieee international symposium on wearables computers iswc in cambridge massachusetts the symposium was a full academic conference with published proceedings and papers ranging from sensors and new hardware to new applications for wearable computers with 382 people registered for the event edit 2000s in 2002 as part of kevin warwick s project cyborg warwick s wife irena wore a necklace which was electronically linked to warwick s nervous system via an implanted electrode array the color of the necklace changed between red and blue dependent on the signals on warwick s nervous system 27 dr bruce h thomas and dr wayne piekarski developed the tinmith wearable computer system to support augmented reality this work was first published internationally in 2000 in the iswc conference the worked was carried out of the wearable computer lab at the university of south australia edit 2010s the current moves in standardization with ieee ietf and several industry groups e g bluetooth leads to more various interfacing under the wpan wireless personal area network and the wban wireless body area network offer new classification of designs for interfacing and networking also the 6th generation ipod nano has a wristwatch attachment available to convert it to a wearable wristwatch computer the developments of wearable computing now encompasses rehabilitation engineering ambulatory intervention treatment life guard systems defense wearable systems clarification needed sony is now selling an android compatible wrist watch called sony smartwatch it must be paired with an android phone as an additional remote display and notification tool http www sonymobile com us products accessories smartwatch edit commercialization image of the zypad wrist wearable computer from arcom control systems the commercialization of general purpose wearable computers as led by companies such as xybernaut cdi and via inc has thus far met with limited success publicly traded xybernaut tried forging alliances with companies such as ibm and sony in order to make wearable computing widely available but in 2005 their stock was delisted and the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection amid financial scandal and federal investigation xybernaut emerged from bankruptcy protection in january 2007 via inc filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and subsequently ceased operations 1998 seiko marketed the ruputer a computer in a fairly large wristwatch to mediocre returns in 2001 ibm developed and publicly displayed two prototypes for a wristwatch computer running linux the last message about them dates to 2004 saying the device would cost about 250 but it is still under development in 2002 fossil inc announced the fossil wrist pda which ran the palm os its release date was set for summer of 2003 but was delayed several times and was finally made available on 5 january 2005 timex datalink is another example of a practical wearable computer hitachi launched a wearable computer called poma in 2002 eurotech offers the zypad a wrist wearable touch screen computer with gps wi fi and bluetooth connectivity and which can run a number of custom applications 28 evidence of the allure of the wearable computer and the weak market acceptance is evident with market leading panasonic computer solutions company s failed product in this market panasonic has specialized in mobile computing with their toughbook line for over 10 years and has extensive market research into the field of portable wearable computing products in 2002 panasonic introduced a wearable brick computer coupled with a handheld or armworn touchscreen the brick would communicate wirelessly to the screen and concurrently the brick would communicate wirelessly out to the internet or other networks the wearable brick was quietly pulled from the market in 2005 while the screen evolved to a thin client touchscreen used with a handstrap the brick computer is the cf 07 toughbook dual batteries screen used same batteries as the base 800 x 600 resolution optional gps and wwan has one m pci slot and one pcmcia slot for expansion cpu used is a 600 mhz pentium 3 factory under clocked to 300 mhz so it can stay cool passively as it has no fan micro dim ram is upgradable the screen can be used wirelessly on other computers google has announced that it has been working on a wearable optical device 29 edit military use this section requires expansion september 2010 the most
