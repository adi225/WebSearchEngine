exploring four main areas of photovoltaic research using current technologies to develop cheaper and more efficient silicon solar cells developing new solution processed thin film photovoltaic devices concentrator photovoltaics and future generation photovoltaic architectures based upon nanostructures such as semiconductor quantum dots and nanowires 78 edit company logo and nickname the company used the globe logo until 1946 when it began using an acronym based logo ibm s current 8 bar logo was designed in 1972 by graphic designer paul rand 79 it was a general replacement for a 13 bar logo that first appeared in the public on the 1966 release of the tss 360 logos designed in the 1970s tended to be sensitive to the technical limitations of photocopiers which were then being widely deployed a logo with large solid areas tended to be poorly copied by copiers in the 1970s so companies preferred logos that avoided large solid areas the 1972 ibm logos are an example of this tendency with the advent of digital copiers in the mid 1980s this technical restriction had largely disappeared at roughly the same time the 13 bar logo was abandoned for almost the opposite reason 160 it was difficult to render accurately on the low resolution digital printers 240 dots per inch of the time the company wrote the ibm initials using individual atoms in 1990 as a demonstration of using a scanning tunneling microscope to move atoms this was the first structure assembled one atom at a time 80 big blue is a nickname for ibm there are several theories explaining the origin of the name one theory substantiated by people who worked for ibm at the time is that ibm field representatives coined the term in the 1960s referring to the color of the mainframes ibm installed in the 1960s and early 1970s true blue referred to a loyal ibm customer and business writers later picked up the term 81 82 another theory suggests that big blue refers to the company s logo a third theory suggests that big blue refers to a former company dress code that required many ibm employees to wear only white shirts and many wore blue suits 81 83 in any event ibm keyboards typewriters and some other manufactured devices have played on the big blue concept using the color for enter keys and carriage returns ibm has also used blue logos since 1947 making blue the defining color of the company s corporate design which might be another more plausible reason for the term citation needed edit see also information technology portal companies portal institute of electrical and electronics
