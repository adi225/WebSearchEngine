interdisciplinary field primarily concerned with the analysis collection classification manipulation storage retrieval movement and dissemination of information 1 practitioners within the field study the application and usage of knowledge in organizations along with the interaction between people organizations and any existing information systems with the aim of creating replacing improving or understanding information systems information science is often mistakenly considered a branch of computer science however it is actually a broad interdisciplinary field incorporating not only aspects of computer science but often diverse fields such as archival science cognitive science commerce communications law library science museology management mathematics philosophy public policy and the social sciences information science should not be confused with information theory or library science information theory is the study of a particular mathematical concept of information while library

information science focuses on understanding problems from the perspective of the stakeholders involved and then applying information and other technologies as needed in other words it tackles systemic problems first rather than individual pieces of technology within that system in this respect information science can be seen as a response to technological determinism the belief that technology develops by its own laws that it realizes its own potential limited only by the material resources available and the creativity of its developers it must therefore be regarded as an autonomous system controlling and ultimately permeating all other subsystems of society 2 many universities have entire colleges departments or schools devoted to the study of information science while numerous information science scholars can be found in disciplines such as communication computer science law library science and sociology several institutions have formed an i school caucus see list of i schools but there are numerous others besides these with comprehensive information foci within information science attention has been given in recent years to human computer interaction groupware the semantic web value sensitive design iterative design processes and to the ways people generate use and find information edit definitions of information science an early definition of information science going back to 1968 the year when american documentation institute shifted name to american society for information science and technology is information science is that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information the forces governing the flow of information and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability it is concerned with that body of knowledge relating to the origination collection organization storage retrieval interpretation transmission transformation and utilization of information this includes the investigation of information representations in both natural and artificial systems the use of codes for efficient message transmission and the study of information processing devices and techniques such as computers and their programming systems it is an interdisciplinary science derived from and related to such fields as mathematics logic linguistics psychology computer technology operations research the graphic arts communications library science management and other similar fields it has both a pure science component which inquires into the subject without regard to its application and an applied science component which develops services and products borko 1968 p 3 3 some authors use informatics as a synonym for information science this is especially true when related to the concept developed by a i mikhailov and other soviet authors in the mid sixties which suggested that informatics is a discipline related to the study of scientific information 4 informatics is difficult to precisely define because of the rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary nature of the field regional differences and international terminology complicate the problem some people note that much of what is called informatics today was once called information science at least in fields such as medical informatics for example when library scientists began also to use the phrase information science to refer to their work the term informatics emerged in the united states as a response by computer scientists to distinguish their work from that of library science and in britain as a term for a science of information that studies natural as well as artificial or engineered information processing systems another term that is debated to a be a synonym for information studies is information systems brian campbell vickery s information systems 1973 places information systems within is ellis allen amp wilson 1999 is on the other hand a bibliometric investigation describing the relation between two different fields information science and information systems edit a multitude of information sciences michael buckland s 2011 article what kind of science can information science be is written from the perspective of library and information science but nonetheless acknowledges that other important fields have also used the name information science one is computer science concerned with the theory and application of algorithms another concerned with entropy probability shannon weaver information theory physical patterns in form ing and related topics is sometimes referred to as the physics of information also the word information is of course used in information technology it also ict for information and communication technologies but largely restricted in practice to the use of electronics for communication and computation these other areas are not considered here instead we are concerned with those areas generally understood as being within the scope of library and information science lis and the interests of the american society for information science and technology edit philosophy of information main article philosophy of information philosophy of information pi studies conceptual issues arising at the intersection of computer science information technology and philosophy it includes the investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of information including its dynamics utilisation and sciences as well as the elaboration and application of information theoretic and computational methodologies to its philosophical problems 5 edit ontology main article ontology information science in computer science and information science an ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts it can be used to reason about the entities within that domain and may be used to describe the domain more specifically an ontology is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types properties and relationship types exactly what is provided around these varies but they are the essentials of an ontology there is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology 6 in theory an ontology is a formal explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation 7 an ontology renders shared vocabulary and taxonomy which models a domain with the definition of objects and or concepts and their properties and relations 8 ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and are used in artificial intelligence the semantic web systems engineering software engineering biomedical informatics library science enterprise bookmarking and information architecture as a form of knowledge representation about the world or some part of it the creation of domain ontologies is also fundamental to the definition and use of an enterprise architecture framework edit careers edit information scientist main article information scientist an information scientist is an individual usually with a relevant subject degree or high level of subject knowledge providing focused information to scientific and technical research staff in industry a role quite distinct from and complementary to that of a librarian the title also applies to an individual carrying out research in information science edit information professional main article information professional an information professional is an individual who preserves organizes and disseminates information information professionals are skilled in the organization and retrieval of recorded knowledge traditionally their work has been with print materials but these skills are being increasingly used with electronic visual audio and digital materials information professionals work in a variety of public private non profit and academic institutions edit history see also information history edit early beginnings gottfried wilhelm leibniz a german polymath who wrote primarily in latin and french his fields of study were metaphysics mathematics theodicy information science in studying the collection classification manipulation storage retrieval and dissemination of information has origins in the common stock of human knowledge information analysis has been carried out by scholars at least as early as the time of the abyssinian empire with the emergence of cultural depositories what is today known as libraries and archives 9 institutionally information science emerged in the 19th century along with many other social science disciplines as a science however it finds its institutional roots in the history of science beginning with publication of the first issues of philosophical transactions generally considered the first scientific journal in 1665 by the royal society london the institutionalization of science occurred throughout the 18th century in 1731 benjamin franklin established the library company of philadelphia the first library owned by a group of public citizens which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center of scientific experiment and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments 10 benjamin franklin invested a town in massachusetts with a collection of books that the town voted to make available to all free of charge forming the first public library 11 academie de chirurgia paris published memoires pour les chirurgiens generally considered to be the first medical journal in 1736 the american philosophical society patterned on the royal society london was founded in philadelphia in 1743 as numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded alois senefelder developed the concept of lithography for use in mass printing work in germany in 1796 edit 19th century joseph marie jacquard by the 19th century the first signs of information science emerged as separate and distinct from other sciences and social sciences but in conjunction with communication and computation in 1801 joseph marie jacquard invented a punched card system to control operations of the cloth weaving loom in france it was the first use of memory storage of patterns system 12 as chemistry journals emerged throughout the 1820s and 1830s 13 charles babbage developed his difference engine the first step towards the modern computer in 1822 and his analytical engine by 1834 by 1843 richard hoe developed the rotary press and in 1844 samuel morse sent the first public telegraph message by 1848 william f poole begins the index to periodical literature the first general periodical literature index in the us in 1854 george boole published an investigation into laws of thought which lays the foundations for boolean algebra which is later used in information retrieval 14 in 1860 a congress was held at karlsruhe technische hochschule to discuss the feasibility of establishing a systematic and rational nomenclature for chemistry the congress did not reach any conclusive results but several key participants returned home with stanislao cannizzaro s outline 1858 which ultimately convinces them of the validity of his scheme for calculating atomic weights 15 by 1865 the smithsonian institution began a catalog of current scientific papers which became the international catalogue of scientific papers in 1902 16 the following year the royal society began publication of its catalogue of papers in london in 1868 christopher sholes carlos glidden and s w soule produced the first practical typewriter by 1872 lord kelvin devised an analogue computer to predict the tides and by 1875 frank stephen baldwin was granted the first us patent for a practical calculating machine that performs four arithmetic functions 13 alexander graham bell and thomas edison invented the telephone and phonograph in 1876 and 1877 respectively and the american library association was founded in philadelphia in 1879 index medicus was first issued by the library of the surgeon general u s army with john shaw billings as librarian and later the library issues index catalogue which achieved an international reputation as the most complete catalog of medical literature 17 edit european documentation the discipline of documentation science which marks the earliest theoretical foundations of modern information science emerged in the late part of the 19th century in europe together with several more scientific indexes whose purpose was to organize scholarly literature many information science historians cite paul otlet and henri la fontaine as the fathers of information science with the founding of the international institute of bibliography iib in 1895 18 a second generation of european documentalists emerged after the second world war most notably suzanne briet however information science as a term is not popularly used in academia until sometime in the latter part of the 20th century 19 documentalists emphasized the utilitarian integration of technology and technique toward specific social goals according to ronald day as an organized system of techniques and technologies documentation was understood as a player in the historical development of global organization in modernity indeed a major player inasmuch as that organization was dependent on the organization and transmission of information 20 otlet and lafontaine who won the nobel prize in 1913 not only envisioned later technical innovations but also projected a global vision for information and information technologies that speaks directly to postwar visions of a global information society otlet and lafontaine established numerous organizations dedicated to standardization bibliography international associations and consequently international cooperation these organizations were fundamental for ensuring international production in commerce information communication and modern economic development and they later found their global form in such institutions as the league of nations and the united nations otlet designed the universal decimal classification based on melville dewey s decimal classification system 21 although he lived decades before computers and networks emerged what he discussed prefigured what ultimately became the world wide web his vision of a great network of knowledge focused on documents and included the notions of hyperlinks search engines remote access and social networks otlet not only imagined that all the world s knowledge should be interlinked and made available remotely to anyone but he also proceeded to build a structured document collection this collection involved standardized paper sheets and cards filed in custom designed cabinets according to a hierarchical index which culled information worldwide from diverse sources and a commercial information retrieval service which answered written requests by copying relevant information from index cards users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search 21 by 1937 documentation had formally been institutionalized as evidenced by the founding of the american documentation institute adi later called the american society for information science and technology edit transition to modern information science vannevar bush a famous information scientist ca 1940 1944 with the 1950s came increasing awareness of the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and information storage and retrieval as these concepts grew in magnitude and potential so did the variety of information science interests by the 1960s and 70s there was a move from batch processing to online modes from mainframe to mini and microcomputers additionally traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with library programs they further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences humanities and social sciences as well as other professional programs such as law and medicine in their curriculum by the 1980s large databases such as grateful med at the national library of medicine and user oriented services such as dialog and compuserve were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers the 1980s also saw the emergence of numerous special interest groups to respond to the changes by the end of the decade special interest groups were available involving non print media social sciences energy and the environment and community information systems today information science largely examines technical bases social consequences and theoretical understanding of online databases widespread use of databases in government industry and education and the development of the internet and world wide web 22 edit research vectors and applications the following areas are some of those that information science investigates and develops edit information access main article information access information access is an area of research at the intersection of informatics information science information security language technology computer science and library science the objectives of information access research are to automate the processing of large and unwieldy amounts of information and to simplify users access to it applicable technologies include information retrieval text mining machine translation and text categorisation in discussion information access is often defined as concerning the insurance of free and closed access to information and is brought up in discussions on copyright patent law and public domain edit information architecture main article information architecture information architecture ia is the art and science of organizing and labelling websites intranets online communities and software to support usability 23 it is an emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing together principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape 24 typically it involves a model or concept of information which is used and applied to activities that require explicit details of complex information systems these activities include library systems and database development edit information management main article information management information management im is the collection and management of information from one or more sources and the distribution of that information to one or more audiences this sometimes involves those who have a stake in or a right to that information management means the organization of and control over the structure processing and delivery of information throughout the 1970s this was largely limited to files file maintenance and the life cycle management of paper based files other media and records with the proliferation of information technology starting in the 1970s the job of information management took on a new light and also began to include the field of data maintenance edit information retrieval main article information retrieval information retrieval ir is the area of study concerned with searching for documents for information within documents and for metadata about documents as well as that of searching structured storage relational databases and the world wide web automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called information overload many universities and public libraries use ir systems to provide access to books journals and other documents web search engines are the most visible ir applications an information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system queries are formal statements of information needs for example search strings in web search engines in information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection instead several objects may match the query perhaps with different degrees of relevancy an object is an entity that is represented by information in a database user queries are matched against the database information depending on the application the data objects may be for example text documents images 25 audio 26 mind maps 27 or videos often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the ir system but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata most ir systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database match the query and rank the objects according to this value the top ranking objects are then shown to the user the process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query 28 edit information seeking main article information seeking information seeking is the process or activity of attempting to obtain information in both human and technological contexts information seeking is related to but different from information retrieval ir much library and information science lis research has focused on the information seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work studies have been carried out into the information seeking behaviors of librarians 29 academics 30 medical professionals 31 engineers 32 and lawyers 33 among others much of this research has drawn on the work done by leckie pettigrew now fisher and sylvain who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the lis literature as well as the literature of other academic fields on professionals information seeking the authors proposed an analytic model of professionals information seeking behaviour intended to be generalizable across the professions thus providing a platform for future research in the area the model was intended to prompt new insights and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking 1996 p 160 188 the model has been adapted by wilkinson 2001 who proposes a model of the information seeking of lawyers edit information society main article information society an information society is a society where the creation distribution diffusion use integration and manipulation of information is a significant economic political and cultural activity the aim of an information society is to gain competitive advantage internationally through using it in a creative and productive way the knowledge economy is its economic counterpart whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding people who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called digital citizens basically an information society is the means of getting information from one place to another wark 1997 p 160 22 as technology has become more advanced over time so too has the way we have adapted in sharing this information with each other information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society and how to define such concepts it has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology edit knowledge representation and reasoning knowledge representation kr is an area of artificial intelligence research aimed at representing knowledge in symbols to facilitate inferencing from those knowledge elements creating new elements of knowledge the kr can be made to be independent of the underlying knowledge model or knowledge base system kbs such as a semantic network 34 knowledge representation kr research involves analysis of how to reason accurately and effectively and how best to use a set of symbols to represent a set of facts within a knowledge domain a symbol vocabulary and a system of logic are combined to enable inferences about elements in the kr to create new kr sentences logic is used to supply formal semantics of how reasoning functions should be applied to the symbols in the kr system logic is also used to define how operators can process and reshape the knowledge examples of operators and operations include negation conjunction adverbs adjectives quantifiers and modal operators the logic is interpretation theory these elements symbols operators and interpretation theory are what give sequences of symbols meaning within a kr edit see also information science portal university portal outline of information science outline of information technology outline of library
