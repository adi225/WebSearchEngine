in computing a spell checker or spell check is an application program that flags words in a document that may not be spelt or spelled us english correctly spell checkers may be stand alone capable of operating on a block of text or as part of a larger application such as a word processor email client electronic dictionary or search engine eye have a spelling chequer it came with my pea sea it

jerrold h zar in 1992 an unsophisticated spell checker will find little or no fault with this poem because it checks words in isolation a more sophisticated spell checker will make use of a language

references 9 external links edit design a spell checker customarily consists of two parts a set of routines for scanning text and extracting words and an algorithm for comparing the extracted words against a known list of correctly spelled words i e the dictionary the scanning routines sometimes include language dependent algorithms for handling morphology even for a lightly inflected language like english word extraction routines will need to handle such phenomena as contractions and possessives it is unclear whether morphological analysis provides a significant benefit for english though its benefits for highly synthetic languages such as german hungarian or turkish are clear the word list might contain just a list of words or it might also contain additional information such as hyphenation points or lexical and grammatical attributes as an adjunct to these two components the program s user interface will allow users to approve replacements and modify the program s operation one exception to the above paradigm are spell checkers which use solely statistical information such as n grams this approach usually requires a lot of effort to obtain sufficient statistical information and may require a lot more runtime storage these methods are not currently in general use in some cases spell checkers use a fixed list of misspellings and suggestions for those misspellings this less flexible approach is often used in paper based correction methods such as the see also entries of encyclopedias edit history research extends back to 1957 including spelling checkers for bitmap images of cursive writing and special applications to find records in databases in spite of incorrect entries in 1961 les earnest who headed the research on this budding technology saw it necessary to include the first spell checker that accessed a list of 10 000 acceptable words 1 ralph gorin a graduate student under earnest at the time created the first true spelling checker program written as an applications program rather than research for general english text spell for the dec pdp 10 at stanford university s artificial intelligence laboratory in february 1971 2 gorin wrote spell in assembly language for faster action he made the first spelling corrector by searching the word list for plausible correct spellings that differ by a single letter or adjacent letter transpositions and presenting them to the user gorin made spell publicly accessible as was done with most sail stanford artificial intelligence laboratory programs and it soon spread around the world via the new arpanet about ten years before personal computers came into general use 3 spell its algorithms and data structures inspired the unix ispell program the first spell checkers were widely available on mainframe computers in the late 1970s a group of six linguists from georgetown university developed the first spell check system for the ibm corporation 4 the company software concepts inc founded by william j tobin in 1978 developed one of the first patented computer software programs in the united states for spelling verification the program was used by most major word processing and photo typesetting systems including lanier philips and xerox among many others 5 6 the patent the company was issued in 1980 for the spell checking program was one of the first software patents issued in the united states canada and europe 6 the first spell checkers for personal computers appeared for cp m and trs 80 computers in 1980 followed by packages for the ibm pc after it was introduced in 1981 developers such as maria mariani 4 soft art microlytics proximity circle noetics and reference software citation needed rushed oem packages or end user products into the rapidly expanding software market primarily for the pc but also for apple macintosh vax and unix on the pcs these spell checkers were standalone programs many of which could be run in tsr mode from within word processing packages on pcs with sufficient memory however the market for standalone packages was short lived as by the mid 1980s developers of popular word processing packages like wordstar and wordperfect had incorporated spell checkers in their packages mostly licensed from the above companies who quickly expanded support from just english to european and eventually even asian languages however this required increasing sophistication in the morphology routines of the software particularly with regard to heavily agglutinative languages like hungarian and finnish although the size of the word processing market in a country like iceland might not have justified the investment of implementing a spell checker companies like wordperfect nonetheless strove to localize their software for as many as possible national markets as part of their global marketing strategy recently spell checking has moved beyond word processors as firefox 2 0 a web browser has spell check support for user written content such as when editing wikitext writing on many webmail sites blogs and social networking websites the web browsers google chrome konqueror and opera the email client kmail and the instant messaging client pidgin also offer spell checking support transparently using gnu aspell as their engine mac os x now has spell check systemwide extending the service to virtually all bundled and third party applications edit functionality the first spell checkers were verifiers instead of correctors they offered no suggestions for incorrectly spelled words this was helpful for typos but it was not so helpful for logical or phonetic errors the challenge the developers faced was the difficulty in offering useful suggestions for misspelled words this requires reducing words to a skeletal form and applying pattern matching algorithms it might seem logical that where spell checking dictionaries are concerned the bigger the better so that correct words are not marked as incorrect in practice however an optimal size for english appears to be around 90 000 entries if there are more than this incorrectly spelled words may be skipped because they are mistaken for others for example a linguist might determine on the basis of corpus linguistics that the word baht is more frequently a misspelling of bath or bat than a reference to the thai currency hence it would typically be more useful if a few people who write about thai currency were slightly inconvenienced than if the spelling errors of the many more people who discuss baths were overlooked a screenshot of the abiword spell checker the first ms dos spell checkers were mostly used in proofing mode from within word processing packages after preparing a document a user scanned the text looking for misspellings later however batch processing was offered in such packages as oracle s short lived coauthor this allowed a user to view the results after a document was processed and only correct the words that he or she knew to be wrong when memory and processing power became abundant spell checking was performed in the background in an interactive way such as has been the case with the sector software produced spellbound program released in 1987 and microsoft word since word 95 in recent years spell checkers have become increasingly sophisticated some are now capable of recognizing simple grammatical errors however even at their best they rarely catch all the errors in a text such as homophone errors and will flag neologisms and foreign words as misspellings nonetheless spell checkers can be considered as a type of foreign language writing aid that non native language learners can rely on to detect and correct their misspellings in the target language 7 edit spell checking non english languages english is unusual in that most words used in formal writing have a single spelling that can be found in a typical dictionary with the exception of some jargon and modified words in many languages however it is typical to frequently combine words in new ways in german compound nouns are frequently coined from other existing nouns some scripts do not clearly separate one word from another requiring word splitting algorithms each of these presents unique challenges to non english language spell checkers edit context sensitive spell checkers recently research has focused on developing algorithms which are capable of recognizing a misspelled word even if the word itself is in the vocabulary based on the context of the surrounding words not only does this allow words such as those in the poem above to be caught but it mitigates the detrimental effect of enlarging dictionaries allowing more words to be recognized for example baht in the same paragraph as thai or thailand would not be recognized as a misspelling of bath the most common example of errors caught by such a system are homophone errors such as the bold words in the following sentence their coming too sea if its reel the most successful algorithm to date is andrew golding and dan roth s winnow based spelling correction algorithm 8 published in 1999 which is able to recognize about 96 of context sensitive spelling errors in addition to ordinary non word spelling errors a context sensitive spell checker appears in microsoft office 2007 9 google wave 10 ginger software 11 and in ghotit dyslexia software 12 context spell checker tuned for people with dyslexia edit criticism some critics who of technology and computers have attempted to link spell checkers to a trend of skill losses in writing reading and speaking they claim that the convenience of computers has led people to become lazy often not proofreading written work past a simple pass by a spell checker supporters who claim that these changes may actually be beneficial to society by making writing and learning new languages more accessible to the general public they claim that the skills lost by the invention of automated spell checkers are being replaced by better skills such as faster and more efficient research skills other supporters of technology point to the fact that these skills are not being lost to people who require and make use of them regularly such as authors critics and language professionals 13 an example of the problem of completely relying on spell checkers is shown in the spell checker poem 14 above it was originally composed by dr jerrold h zar 15 in 1991 assisted by mark eckman 16 with an original length of 225 words and containing 123 incorrectly used words according to most spell checkers the poem is valid although most people would be able to tell at a simple glance that most words are used incorrectly as a result spell checkers are sometimes derided as spilling chuckers or similar slightly misspelled names not all of the critics are opponents of technological progress however an article based on research by galletta et al 17 reports that in the galletta study higher verbal skills are needed for highest performance when using a spell checker the theory suggested that only writers with higher verbal skills could recognize and ignore false positives or incorrect suggestions however it was found that those with the higher skills lost their unaided performance advantage in multiple categories of errors performing as poorly as the low verbals with the spell checkers turned on the conclusion points to some evidence of a loss of skill edit see also wikimedia commons has media related to spell checking cupertino effect grammar checker record linkage problem
