evolutionary biology portal category related topics book v t e in computer science evolutionary computation is a subfield of artificial intelligence more particularly computational intelligence that involves combinatorial optimization problems evolutionary computation uses iterative progress such as growth or development in a population this population is then selected in a guided random search using parallel processing to achieve the desired end such processes are often inspired by biological mechanisms of evolution as evolution can produce highly optimised processes and networks it has

8 bibliography 9 references edit history the use of darwinian principles for automated problem solving originated in the 1950s it was not until the 1960s that three distinct interpretations of this idea started to be developed in three different places evolutionary programming was introduced by lawrence j fogel in the us while john henry holland called his method a genetic algorithm in germany ingo rechenberg and hans paul schwefel introduced evolution strategies these areas developed separately for about 15 years from the early nineties on they are unified as different representatives dialects of one technology called evolutionary computing also in the early nineties a fourth stream following the general ideas had emerged genetic programming since the 1990s evolutionary computation has largely become swarm based computation and nature inspired algorithms are becoming an increasingly significant part these terminologies denote the field of evolutionary computing and consider evolutionary programming evolution strategies genetic algorithms and genetic programming as sub areas simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life started with the work of nils aall barricelli in the 1960s and was extended by alex fraser who published a series of papers on simulation of artificial selection 1 artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of ingo rechenberg in the 1960s and early 1970s who used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems 2 genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of john holland 3 as academic interest grew dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications including the automatic evolution of computer programs 4 evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems 5 edit

organizing migrating genetic algorithm swarm based computing edit evolutionary algorithms main article evolutionary algorithm evolutionary algorithms form a subset of evolutionary computation in that they generally only involve techniques implementing mechanisms inspired by biological evolution such as reproduction mutation recombination natural selection and survival of the fittest candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population and the cost function determines the environment within which the solutions live see also fitness function evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators in this process there are two main forces that form the basis of evolutionary systems recombination and mutation create the necessary diversity and thereby facilitate novelty while selection acts as a force increasing quality many aspects of such an evolutionary process are stochastic changed pieces of information due to recombination and mutation are randomly chosen on the other hand selection operators can be either deterministic or stochastic in the latter case individuals with a higher fitness have a higher chance to be selected than individuals with a lower fitness but typically even the weak individuals have a chance to become a parent or to survive edit some of evolutionary computation
