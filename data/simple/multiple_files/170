spill in the gulf of mexico which flowed unabated for three months in 2010 and may be continuing to leak 7 8 named the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry its source was a sea floor oil gusher resulting from the 20 april 2010 deepwater horizon explosion which claimed 11 lives 9 10 11 12 the deepwater horizon drilled on the bp operated macondo prospect block 252 the gushing wellhead was capped after 87 days on 15 july 2010 11 13 an estimated 53 000 barrels per day 8 400 160 m 3 d or 2 2 million gallons of crude oil spewed into the gulf the total discharge is estimated at 4 9 million barrels 210 160 million us 160 gal 780 000 160 m 3 3 the well was declared sealed on 19 september 2010 14 the response plan to protect beaches wetlands and estuaries from the spreading oil employed various methods including skimmer ships floating boom controlled burns and an estimated 2 million us gallons 7 600 160 m 3 of corexit oil dispersant the spill and its clean up caused human health problems 15 as well as extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats and the gulf s fishing and tourism industries 16 in the summer of 2010 scientists reported immense underwater plumes of dissolved oil 17 in addition to an 80 square mile 210 160 km 2 kill zone surrounding the blown well 18 by july 2011 roughly 491 miles 790 160 km of coastline in louisiana mississippi alabama and florida remained contaminated by oil 19 tar balls continued to wash up along the gulf coast two years after the spill began 20 researchers found that oil on the bottom of the seafloor does not seem to be degrading 21 and that as much as one third of the released oil may remain in gulf 22 noaa stated that dolphins and whales were dying at twice the normal rate in 2011 23 scientists in 2012 reported finding alarming numbers of mutated crab shrimp and fish resulting from chemicals released during the spill 24 corexit made the oil 52 times more toxic and allowed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs to more deeply penetrate beaches and possibly groundwater according to a 2012 study 25 26 in january 2011 the white house oil spill commission released its final report on the causes of the oil spill they blamed bp and its partners for making a series of cost cutting decisions and the lack of a system to ensure well safety they also concluded that the spill was not an isolated incident caused by rogue industry or government officials but that the root causes are systemic and absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies might well recur 27 after its own internal probe bp admitted that it made mistakes which led to the gulf of mexico oil spill 28 in june 2010 bp set up a 20 billion fund to compensate victims of the oil spill 29 30 in september 2011 the u s government published its final investigative report on the accident 31 in essence that report states that the main cause was the defective cement job and put most of the fault for the oil spill with bp also faulting deepwater horizon operator transocean and contractor halliburton 31 32 the first spill related arrest was in april 2012 an engineer was charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly deleting 300 text messages showing bp knew the flow rate was three times higher than initial claims by the company and knew that top kill was unlikely to succeed but claimed otherwise 33 34 35 charges have been filed also against three other bp employees for obstruction of justice lying to federal investigators withholding information from congress ignoring abnormally high pressure readings and manslaughter 36 37 on 14 november 2012 bp agreed to plead guilty and pay a record breaking 4 525 160 billion in fines and other payments for a criminal settlement it also plead guilty to 11 counts of seaman s manslaughter related to the deepwater explosion and fire 38 39 bp faces payouts to thousands of fishermen businesses and others harmed by the spill as well as fines under the clean water act which could reach 21 160 billion estimates of the total amount of penalties that bp may be required to pay have reached as high as 90 160 billion 40 in november 2012 the epa announced that bp will be temporarily banned from seeking new contracts with the us government because of the company s lack of business integrity during the disaster 41 contents

the deepwater horizon oil spill an oil leak was discovered on the afternoon of 22 april when a large oil slick began to spread at the former rig site 54 according to the flow rate technical group the leak amounted to about 4 9 million barrels 210 000 000 160 us 160 gal 780 000 160 m 3 of oil exceeding the 1989 exxon valdez oil spill as the largest ever to originate in u s controlled waters and the 1979 ixtoc i oil spill as the largest spill in the gulf of mexico 3 11 bp has challenged this calculation saying that it is overestimated as it includes over 810 000 barrels 34 000 000 160 us 160 gal 129 000 160 m 3 of oil which was collected before it could enter the gulf waters 55 edit spill flow rate in its permit to drill the well bp estimated the worst case flow at 162 000 barrels per day 25 800 160 m 3 d 56 immediately after the explosion the uscg did not estimate any oil leaking from the sunken rig or from the well 57 on 24 april uscg rear admiral mary landry announced that a damaged wellhead was indeed leaking 58 59 she stated that the leak was a new discovery but could have begun when the offshore platform sank two days after the initial explosion 58 initial estimates by uscg and bp officials based on remotely operated vehicles as well as the oil slick size indicated the leak was as much as 1 000 barrels per day 160 160 m 3 d 58 outside scientists quickly produced higher estimates which presaged later increases in official numbers 60 61 62 official estimates increased from 1 000 to 5 000 barrels per day 160 to 790 m 3 d on 29 april 63 64 to 12 000 to 19 000 barrels

administration noaa united states geological survey usgs bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement boemre u s department of energy doe and outside academics led by usgs director marcia mcnutt 76 77 78 the later estimates were believed to be more accurate because it was no longer necessary to measure multiple leaks and because detailed pressure measurements and high resolution video had become available 79 according to bp estimating the oil flow was very difficult as there was no underwater metering at the wellhead and because of the natural gas in the outflow 63 the company had initially refused to allow scientists to perform more accurate independent measurements saying that it was not relevant to the response and that such efforts might distract from efforts to stem the flow 17 former epa administrator carol browner and congressman ed markey d ma both accused bp of having a vested financial interest in downplaying the size of the leak in part due to the fine they will have to pay based on the amount of leaked oil 80 the final estimate reported that 53 000 barrels per day 8 400 160 m 3 d were escaping from the well just before it was capped on 15 july it is believed that the daily flow rate diminished over time starting at about 62 000 barrels per day 9 900 160 m 3 d and decreasing as the reservoir of hydrocarbons feeding the gusher was gradually depleted 11 in a 3 december 2010 statement bp claimed the government overestimated the size of the spill by between 20 and 50 a document submitted by bp to the commission noaa and the justice department says that they rely on incomplete or inaccurate information rest in large part on assumptions that have not been validated and are subject to far greater uncertainties than have been acknowledged representative edward markey a member of the house energy panel that is investigating the spill said in a statement that bp has done whatever it could to avoid revealing the true flow rate of the spill with billions of dollars at stake it is no surprise that they are now litigating the very numbers which they sought to impede a bp spokesperson said that bp fully intends to present its own estimate as soon as the information is available to get the science right 81 edit spill area and thickness oil slicks surround the chandeleur islands louisiana in this aerial photo the oil s spread was initially increased by strong southerly winds caused by an impending cold front by 25 april 2010 the oil spill covered 580 square miles 1 500 160 km 2 and was only 31 miles 50 160 km from the ecologically sensitive chandeleur islands 82 an 30 april 2010 estimate placed the total spread of the oil at 3 850 square miles 10 000 160 km 2 83 the spill quickly approached the delta national wildlife refuge and breton national wildlife refuge 84 on 19 may 2010 both noaa and other scientists monitoring the spill with the european space agency envisat radar satellite stated that oil had reached the loop current which flows clockwise around the gulf of mexico towards florida and then joins the gulf stream along the u s east coast 85 on 29 june 2010 noaa determined that the oil slick was no longer a threat to the loop current and stopped tracking offshore oil predictions that include the loop currents region the omission is noted prominently on the ongoing nearshore surface oil forecasts that are posted daily on noaa s website 85 86 on 14 may 2010 the automated data inquiry for oil spills model indicated that about 35 of a hypothetical 114 000 barrel 18 100 160 m 3 spill of light louisiana crude oil released in conditions similar to those found in the gulf would evaporate that 50 to 60 of the oil would remain in or on the water and the rest would be dispersed in the ocean 87 the wellhead was capped on 15 july 2010 and by 30 july the surface oil appeared to have dissipated more rapidly than expected some scientists believe that the rapid dissipation of the surface oil may have been due to a combination of factors that included the natural capacity of the region to break down oil petroleum normally leaks from the ocean floor by way of thousands of natural seeps and certain bacteria can consume it winds from storms appeared to have aided in rapidly dispersing the oil and the cleanup response by bp and the government helped control surface slicks as much as 40 of the oil may have simply evaporated at the ocean surface and an unknown amount remains below the surface 88 however many scientists dispute the report s methodology and figures 89 scientists said much oil was still underwater and could not be detected 90 according to the noaa report released on 4 august 2010 about half of the oil leaked into the gulf remains on or below the gulf s surface 91 some scientists are calling the noaa estimates ludicrous according to usf chemical oceanographer david hollander while 25 of the oil can be accounted for by burning skimming etc 75 is still unaccounted for 92 the federal calculations are based on direct measurements for only 430 000 barrels 68 000 160 m 3 of the oil spilled the oil burned and skimmed according to bill lehr an author of the noaa report the other numbers are educated scientific guesses because it is impossible to measure oil that is dispersed fsu oceanography professor ian macdonald called it a shaky report and is unsatisfied with the thoroughness of the presentation and sweeping assumptions involved 93 john kessler of texas a amp m who led a national science foundation on site study of the spill said the report that 75 of the oil is gone is just not true and that 50 to 75 of the material that came out of the well remains in the water in a dissolved or dispersed form 94 on 16 august 2010 uga scientists said their analysis of federal estimates show that 80 of the oil the government said was gone from the gulf of mexico is still there the georgia team said it is a misinterpretation of data to claim that oil that is dissolved is actually gone 95 edit oil sightings oil began washing up on the beaches of gulf islands national seashore on 1 june 2010 96 by 4 june 2010 the oil spill had landed on 125 miles 201 160 km of louisiana s coast had washed up along mississippi and alabama barrier islands and was found for the first time on a florida barrier island at pensacola beach 97 on 9 june 2010 oil sludge began entering the intracoastal waterway through perdido pass after floating booms across the opening of the pass failed to stop the oil 98 on 23 june 2010 oil appeared on pensacola beach and in gulf islands national seashore and officials warned against swimming for 33 miles 53 160 km east of the alabama line 99 100 on 27 june 2010 tar balls and small areas of oil reached gulf park estates the first appearance of oil in mississippi 101 early in july 2010 tar balls reached grand isle but 800 volunteers were cleaning them up 102 on 3 and 4 july 2010 tar balls and other isolated oil residue began washing ashore at beaches in bolivar and galveston though it was believed a ship transported them there and no further oil was found 5 july 103 on 5 july 2010 strings of oil were found in the rigolets in louisiana and the next day tar balls reached the shore of lake pontchartrain 103 104 the amount of louisiana shoreline affected by oil grew from 287 miles 462 160 km in july to 320 miles 510 160 km in late november 2010 105 on 10 september 2010 it was reported that a new wave of oil suddenly coated 16 miles 26 160 km of louisiana coastline and marshes west of the mississippi river in plaquemines parish the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries confirmed the sightings 106 on 23 october 2010 it was reported that miles long stretches of weathered oil had been sighted in west bay texas between southwest pass the main shipping channel of the mississippi river and tiger pass near venice louisiana the sightings were confirmed by matthew hinton of the times picayune 107 at the end of october 2010 two research vessels studying the spill s effect on sea life found substantial amounts of oil on the seafloor kevin yeager a usm assistant professor of marine sciences found oil in samples dug up from the seafloor in a 140 mile 230 160 km radius around the site of the macondo well the oil ranged from light degraded oil to thick raw crude the sheer abundance of oil and its proximity to the well site though makes it highly likely that the oil is from the macondo well a second research team turned up traces of oil in sediment samples as well as evidence of chemical dispersants in blue crab larvae and long plumes of oxygen depleted water emanating from the well site 50 miles 80 160 km off louisiana s coast 108 in late november 2010 plaquemine parish louisiana coastal zone director p j hahn reported that more than 32 000 us gallons 120 160 m 3 of oil had been sucked out of nearby marshes in the previous 10 160 day period in barataria bay louisiana photos and firsthand accounts show oil still reaching high into the marshes baby crabs and adult shrimp covered by crude and oil slicks on the surface of the water 105 in january 2011 an oil spill commissioner reported that tar balls continue to wash up oil sheen trails are seen in the wake of fishing boats wetlands marsh grass remains fouled and dying and crude oil lies offshore in deep water and in fine silts and sands onshore 109 on 26 may 2011 the louisiana department of environmental quality extended the state of emergency related to the oil spill 110 in april 2012 oil was found dotting 200 miles 320 160 km of louisiana s coast 111 edit underwater oil plumes on 15 may 2010 researchers from the national institute for undersea science and technology 112 aboard the research vessel rv pelican identified oil plumes in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico 113 including one as large as 10 miles 16 160 km long 3 miles 4 8 160 km wide and 300 feet 91 160 m thick in spots the shallowest oil plume the group detected was at about 2 300 feet 700 160 m while the deepest was near the seafloor at about 4 593 feet 1 400 160 m 4 593 114 other researchers from the uga found that the oil may have occupied multiple layers 115 by 27 may 2010 marine scientists from the usf had discovered a second oil plume stretching 22 miles 35 160 km from the leaking wellhead toward mobile bay alabama the oil had dissolved into the water and was no longer visible undersea plumes may have been the result of the use of wellhead chemical dispersants 116 noaa conducted an independent analysis of the water samples provided from the 22 28 may 2010 research mission of the usf s weatherbird ii vessel the samples from all undersea plumes were in very low concentrations less than 0 5 parts per million noaa indicated that one of the plumes was unrelated to the bp wellhead leak while the other plume samples were in concentrations too low or too highly fractionated to determine their origin 117 in a report released on 8 june 2010 noaa stated that one plume was consistent with the oil from the leak one was not consistent and that they were unable to determine the origin of two samples 117 on 23 june 2010 noaa released a report which confirmed deepwater oil plumes in the gulf and that they did originate from bp s well stating 118 the preponderance of evidence based on careful examination of the results from these four different cruises leads us to conclude that dwh mc252 oil exists in subsurface waters near the well site in addition to the oil observed at the sea surface and that this oil appears to be chemically dispersed while no chemical fingerprinting of samples was conducted to conclusively determine origin the proximity to the well site and the following analysis support this conclusion 119 reporting on a study that ended on 28 june 2010 scientists published conclusive evidence of a deep plume 22 miles 35 160 km long linked directly to the deepwater horizon well they reported that it did not appear to be degrading quickly and that it may pose a long lasting threat for marine life deep in the ocean 120 on 23 july 2010 usf researchers and noaa released two separate studies confirming subsea plumes of oil resulting from the deepwater horizon well 121 researchers from noaa and princeton university concluded that the deep plumes of dissolved oil and gas would likely remain confined to the northern gulf of mexico and that the peak impact on dissolved oxygen would be delayed several months and long lasting years 122 david valentine of ucsb believes that the oil plumes had been diluted in the ocean faster than they had biodegraded suggesting that the lbnl researchers had overestimated the rate of biodegration 123 in october 2010 scientists reported a continuous plume of over 22 miles 35 160 km in length at a depth of about 3 600 160 ft 1 100 160 m that plume persisted for several months without substantial degradation 124 noaa s research vessels later found evidence of the multiple undersea plumes and lubchenco subsequently warned that these plumes might be the source of some of the most significant impacts due to the effect on juvenile bluefin tuna and other fish 125 edit suppression of science when scientists initially reported the discovery of undersea oil plumes bp stated its sampling showed no evidence that oil was massing and spreading in the gulf water column noaa chief jane lubchenco urged caution calling the reports misleading premature and in some cases inaccurate 126 scientists from the usf and the usm said that when they brought the evidence of deep sea plumes to noaa and the uscg the government tried to suppress their findings 127 128 129 according to vernon asper oceanographer at usg we expected that noaa would be pleased because we found something very very interesting noaa instead responded by trying to discredit us 130 edit oil on seafloor on 10 september 2010 samantha joye a professor in the department of marine sciences at the university of georgia on a research vessel in the gulf of mexico announced her team s findings of a substantial layer of oily sediment stretching for dozens of miles in all directions suggesting that a lot of oil did not evaporate or dissipate but may have settled to the seafloor she describes seeing layers of oily material covering the bottom of the seafloor in some places more than 2 inches 51 160 mm thick on top of normal sediments containing dead shrimp and other organisms she speculates that the source may be organisms that have broken down the spilled oil and excreted an oily mucus that sinks taking with it oil droplets that stick to the mucous we have to chemically fingerprint the oil and link it to the deepwater horizon she says but the sheer coverage here is leading us all to come to the conclusion that it has to be sedimented oil from the oil spill because it s all over the place 131 132 by january 2011 usf researchers found layers of oil near the wellhead that were up to 5 times thicker than recorded by the team in august 2010 usf s david hollander remarked oil s presence on the ocean floor didn t diminish with time it grew and he pointed out the layer is distributed very widely radiating far from the wellhead 133 in 2013 some scientists at the gulf of mexico oil spill and ecosystem science conference said that as much as one third of the oil may have been mixed with deep ocean sediments and dragged to the bottom of the ocean floor where it remains risking damage to ecosystems and commercial fisheries 134 edit independent monitoring wildlife and environmental groups accused bp of holding back information about the extent and impact of the growing slick and urged the white house to order a more direct federal government role in the spill response in prepared testimony for a congressional committee national wildlife federation president larry schweiger said bp had failed to disclose results from its tests of chemical dispersants used on the spill and that bp had tried to withhold video showing the true magnitude of the leak 135 on 19 may 2010 bp established a live feed popularly known as spillcam of the oil spill after hearings in congress accused the company of withholding data from the ocean floor and blocking efforts by independent scientists to come up with estimates for the amount of crude flowing into the gulf each day 136 137 on 20 may 2010 united states secretary of the interior ken salazar indicated that the u s government would verify how much oil had leaked into the gulf of mexico 138 united states environmental protection agency epa administrator lisa jackson and united states secretary of homeland security janet napolitano asked for the results of tests looking for traces of oil and dispersant chemicals in the waters of the gulf 139 journalists attempting to document the impact of the oil spill were repeatedly refused access to public areas and photojournalists were prevented from flying over areas of the gulf to document the scope of the disaster these accusations were leveled at bp its contractors local law enforcement uscg and other government officials 140 141 scientists also complained about prevention of access to information controlled by bp and government sources 140 bp stated that its policy was to allow the media and other parties as much access as possible 140 on 30 june 2010 the uscg put new restrictions in place across the gulf coast that prevented vessels from coming within 20 meters 66 160 ft of booming operations boom or oil spill response operations 142 in a press briefing uscg admiral thad allen said the new regulation was related to safety issues 143 on cnn s 360 host anderson cooper rejected the motivation for the restrictions outright 144 the civil air patrol also monitored the oil spill on behalf of the uscg 27 may 2010 145 edit efforts to stem the flow of oil main article efforts to stem the

april the q4000 and the discoverer enterprise during the failed top kill procedure concept diagram of underwater oil containment domes originally planned for the deepwater horizon oil spill at this stage there were 2 remaining oil leaks from the fallen pipeline the first attempts to stop the flow of oil was the use of remotely operated underwater vehicles to close the blowout preventer valves on the well head however all these attempts failed 82 146 the second technique placing a 125 tonne 280 000 160 lb containment dome which had worked on leaks in shallower water over the largest leak and piping the oil to a storage vessel on the surface failed when gas leaking from the pipe combined with cold water formed methane hydrate crystals that blocked the opening at the top of the dome 147 attempts to close the well by pumping heavy drilling fluids into the blowout preventer to restrict the flow of oil before sealing it permanently with cement top kill also failed 148 149 more successful was positioning a riser insertion tube into the wide burst pipe there was a stopper like washer around the tube that plugs the end of the riser and diverts the flow into the insertion tube 150 the collected gas was flared and oil stored on the board of drillship discoverer enterprise 151 before the tube was removed 924 000 us gallons 22 000 160 bbl of oil were collected 152 by 3 june 2010 bp removed the damaged riser from the top of the blowout preventer and covered the pipe by the cap which connected it to a riser 153 ceo of bp tony hayward stated that as a result of this process the amount captured was probably the vast majority of the oil 154 however the frtg member ira leifer said that more oil was escaping than before the riser was cut and the cap containment system was placed 155 on 16 june 2010 a second containment system connected directly to the blowout preventer became operational carrying oil and gas to service vessels where it was immolated in a clean burning system 30 on 5 july 2010 bp announced that its one day oil recovery effort accounted for about 25 000 barrels 4 000 160 m 3 of oil and the flaring off of 57 1 million cubic feet 1 62 10 6 160 m 3 of natural gas the total oil collection to date for the spill was estimated at 660 000 barrels 105 000 160 m 3 156 the government s estimates suggested the cap and other equipment were capturing less than half of the oil leaking from the sea floor as of late june 2010 99 on 10 july 2010 the containment cap was removed to replace it with a better fitting cap consisting of a flange transition spool and a 3 ram stack top hat number 10 157 158 on 15 july bp tested the well integrity by shutting off pipes that were funneling some of the oil to ships on the surface so the full force of the gusher from the wellhead went up into the cap 159 160 the attempt to cap the wellhead was successful and mud and cement were later pumped in through the top of the well to reduce the pressure inside it providing a temporary stop to the flow of oil 13 edit considerations of using explosives in mid may united states secretary of energy steven chu assembled a team of nuclear physicists including hydrogen bomb designer richard garwin and sandia national laboratories director tom hunter 161 oil expert matthew simmons maintained that a nuclear explosion would be the only way bp could permanently seal the well and cited successful attempts by the soviet union using nuclear blasts to seal off runaway gas wells a spokesperson for the us energy department said that neither energy secretary steven chu nor anyone else was ever considering a nuclear blast under the gulf 162 163 on 24 may 2010 bp ruled out conventional explosives saying that if blasts failed to clog the well we would have denied ourselves all other options 164 edit permanent closure transocean s development driller iii started drilling a first relief well on 2 may 2010 gsf development driller ii started drilling a second

continued for eight hours at the end of which time the well was declared to be in a static condition 171 on 4 august bp began pumping cement from the top sealing that part of the flow channel permanently 172 on 3 september 2010 the 300 ton failed blowout preventer was removed from the well and a replacement blowout preventer was installed 173 174 on 16 september the relief well reached its destination and pumping of cement to seal the well began 175 on 19 september 2010 uscg s thad allen ret declared bp s well effectively dead and said that it posed no further threat to the gulf 176 edit recurrent or continued leakage oil at or near the site of the spill following well closure has suggested to some that there is continued or recurrent leakage nbc nightly news reported the slick on march 22 2011 177 in august 2011 oil and oil sheen covering several square miles of water were again reported surfacing not far from bp s macondo well 178 179 scientific analysis confirmed that the oil is a chemical match for macondo 252 180 181 the uscg said the oil was too dispersed to recover and posed no threat to the coastline 182 in march 2012 persistent oil seep 183 near the macondo well was again reported 7 more sightings in october 2012 prompted another investigation into the source of the continued oil seepage 184 185 the uscg again found the oil was a chemical match for macondo and sent a notice of federal interest to bp and transocean which warned they may be held financially responsible for clean up related to the new oil 186 congressman ed markey called on bp to come up with a plan to remove all remaining oil from the dome and any other wreckage he repeated his request for the release of underwater rov footage taken during the sheen investigation which the uscg had promised but failed to provide 187 the uscg suggested the sheen could be residual oil associated with wreckage and or debris left on the seabed like the riser pipe but said that no one yet knows its origin for sure marcia mcnutt director of the u s geological survey calculated that if the riser pipe was full of oil it could hold at most 1 000 barrels 160 160 m 3 because it s open on both ends she said it s unlikely to hold the amount of oil being observed 188 commenting on the ongoing leakage oceanographer ian macdonald said it s possible that the wreckage in 2010 somehow opened up a new fault on the seafloor 189 in may 2010 bp admitted they had discovered things that were broken in the sub surface during the top kill effort environmental groups share macdonald s concern fearing that the drilling of relief wells or the original well failure may have fractured the sea floor allowing oil to escape 190 in january 2013 the sheen grew to more than seven miles long and one mile wide according to aerial observations made by former nasa physicist bonnie schumaker who observed patches of rainbow and weathered mousse in the sheen 191 samples of the sheen on several occasions have consistently found the presence of alpha olefiens which is a chemical bond signature of a man made chemical you would not find in pure crude form 192 edit efforts to protect the coastline and marine environments united states environmental services workers prepare oil containment booms for deployment a variety of techniques were used to address fundamental strategies for addressing the spilled oil which were to contain oil on the surface dispersal and removal while most of the oil drilled off louisiana is a lighter crude the leaking oil was of a heavier blend which contained asphalt like substances according to ed overton who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills this type of oil emulsifies well once it becomes emulsified it no longer evaporates as quickly as regular oil does not rinse off as easily cannot be eaten by microbes as easily and does not burn as well that type of mixture essentially removes all the best oil clean up weapons overton said 193 on 6 may 2010 bp began documenting the daily response efforts on its web site 194 on 28 april the us military joined the cleanup operation 63 the response increased in scale as the spill volume grew initially bp employed remotely operated underwater vehicles rov s 700 160 workers 4 airplanes and 32 160 vessels 58 by 29 april 69 160 vessels including skimmers tugs barges and recovery vessels were in use by 4 may the uscg estimated that 170 160 vessels and nearly 7 500 160 personnel were participating with an additional 2 000 160 volunteers assisting 195 on 31 may bp set up a call line to take cleanup suggestions which received 92 000 responses by late june 320 of which were categorized as promising 196 edit containment an oil containment boom deployed by the u s navy surrounds new harbor island louisiana the response included deploying many miles of containment boom whose purpose is to either corral the oil or to block it from a marsh mangrove shrimp crab oyster ranch or other ecologically sensitive areas booms extend 18 48 160 inches 0 46 1 2 m above and below the water surface and are effective only in relatively calm and slow moving waters more than 100 000 feet 30 160 km of containment booms were initially deployed to protect the coast and the mississippi river delta 197 by the next day that nearly doubled to 180 000 feet 55 160 km with an additional 300 000 feet 91 160 km staged or being deployed 198 199 some us lawmakers and local officials claimed that the booms didn t work as intended saying there is more shoreline to protect than lengths of boom to protect it and that inexperienced operators didn t lay the boom correctly billy nungesser president of plaquemines parish louisiana said the boom washes up on the shore with the oil and then we have oil in the marsh and we have an oily boom so we have two problems 200 according to naomi klein writing for the guardian the ocean s winds and currents have made a mockery of the lightweight booms bp has laid out to absorb the oil byron encalade president of the louisiana oysters association told bp that the oil s gonna go over the booms or underneath the bottom and according to klein he was right rick steiner a marine biologist who closely followed the clean up operations estimated that 70 or 80 of the booms are doing absolutely nothing at all 201 local officials along the gulf maintained that there was a scarcity of boom especially the heavier ocean boom bp in its regional plan says that boom is not effective in waters with waves more than three to four feet high waves in the gulf often exceed that height 202 edit barrier island plan main article louisiana barrier island plan this section is empty you can help by adding to it february 2013 edit dispersal the enormous oil spill was also notable for the volume of corexit oil dispersant used as well as the methods of application this use of dispersant was questioned at the time and its effects continue to be questioned and investigated 203 204 205 edit choice and composition of corexit a c 130 hercules sprays corexit dispersant onto the gulf of mexico corexit ec9500a and corexit ec9527a were the principal dispersants employed 206 the two formulations are neither the least toxic nor the most effective among the epa s approved dispersants 207 twelve other products received better toxicity and effectiveness ratings but bp says it chose to use corexit because it was available the week of the rig explosion 207 208 critics contend that the major oil companies stockpile corexit because of their close business relationship with its manufacturer nalco 207 209 environmental groups attempted to obtain information regarding the composition and safety of ingredients in corexit through the freedom of information act but were denied by the epa after earthjustice sued on behalf of the gulf restoration network and the florida wildlife federation the epa released a list of all 57 chemicals in the 14 dispersents on the epa s national contingency plan product schedule the dispersants used contain propylene glycol 2 butoxyethanol and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate 210 211 earthjustice and toxipedia conducted the first analysis of the 57 chemicals found in corexit formulas 9500 and 9527 in 2011 results showed the dispersant could contain cancer causing agents hazardous toxins and endocrine disrupting chemicals 212 the analysis found 5 chemicals are associated with cancer 33 are associated with skin irritation from rashes to burns 33 are linked to eye irritation 11 are or are suspected of being potential respiratory toxins or irritants 10 are suspected kidney toxins 8 are suspected or known to be toxic to aquatic organisms and 5 are suspected to have a moderate acute toxicity to fish 213 edit method and extent of use on 1 may 2010 two military c 130 hercules aircraft were employed to spray oil dispersant 214 more than half of the 1 1 million us gallons 4 200 160 m 3 of chemical dispersants were applied at the wellhead 5 000 feet 1 500 160 m under the sea 215 this had never previously been tried but due to the unprecedented nature of this spill bp along with the uscg and the epa decided to use the first subsea injection of dispersant directly into oil at the source 216 dispersants are said to facilitate the digestion of the oil by microbes mixing the dispersants with the oil at the wellhead would keep some oil below the surface and in theory allow microbes to digest the oil before it reached the surface various risks were identified and evaluated in particular that an increase in the microbe activity might reduce the oxygen in the water the use of dispersants at the wellhead was pursued and noaa estimated that roughly 409 000 barrels 65 000 160 m 3 of oil were dispersed underwater 217 by 12 july 2010 bp had reported applying 1 07 million us gallons 4 100 160 m 3 of corexit on the surface and 721 000 us gallons 2 730 160 m 3 underwater subsea 218 by 30 july 2010 more than 1 8 million us gallons 6 800 160 m 3 of dispersant had been used mostly corexit 9500 219 dispersant use was said to have stopped after the cap was in place 220 marine toxicologist riki ott wrote an open letter to the epa in late august with evidence that dispersant use had not stopped and that it was being administered near shore 221 independent testing supported her claim new orleans based attorney stuart smith representing the louisiana based united commercial fisherman s association and the louisiana environmental action network said he personally saw c 130s applying dispersants from his hotel room in the florida panhandle they were spraying directly adjacent to the beach right at dusk fishermen i ve talked to say they ve been sprayed this idea they are not using this stuff near the coast is nonsense 222 edit environmental controversy over corexit sign protesting use of toxic corexit chemical dispersant in the bp gulf of mexico oil disaster at the bastille day tumble french quarter new orleans corexit was banned from use on oil spills in the united kingdom a decade prior to the deepwater horizon explosion 223 224 according to the osha required material safety data sheets msdss for both versions of corexit used in the gulf 225 225 component substances have a low potential to bioconcentrate defined by the epa as accumulation of a chemical in tissues of a fish or other organism to levels greater than in the surrounding medium no toxicity studies have been conducted on this product 226 corexit 9500 is a simple blend of six well established safe ingredients that biodegrade do not bioaccumulate and are commonly found in popular household products corexit products do not contain carcinogens or reproductive toxins all the ingredients have been extensively studied for many years and have been determined safe and effective by the epa 227 however 2 butoxyethanol a component of corexit ec9527a was identified as a causal agent in the health problems experienced by cleanup workers after the 1989 exxon valdez oil spill 211 warnings from the hazardous substance fact sheet for 2 butoxyethanol include cancer hazard 2 butoxy ethanol may be a carcinogen in humans since it has been shown to cause liver cancer in animals many scientists believe there is no safe level of exposure to a carcinogen reproductive hazard 2 butoxy ethanol may damage the developing fetus there is limited evidence that 2 butoxy ethanol may damage the male reproductive system including decreasing the sperm count in animals and may affect female fertility in animals 228 environmental scientists say the dispersants which can cause genetic mutations and cancer add to the toxicity of a spill and that sea turtles and bluefin tuna are exposed to an even greater risk than crude alone according to them the dangers are even greater for dispersants poured into the source of a gulf spill where they are picked up by the current and wash through the gulf 229 on 7 may 2010 secretary alan levine of the louisiana department of health and hospitals louisiana department of environmental quality secretary peggy hatch and louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries secretary robert barham sent a letter to bp outlining their concerns related to potential dispersant impact on louisiana s wildlife and fisheries environment aquatic life and public health officials requested that bp release information on their dispersant effects after three underwater tests the epa approved the injection of dispersants directly at the leak site to break up the oil before it reached the surface 230 in mid may independent scientists suggested that underwater injection of corexit into the leak may have been responsible for the oil plumes discovered below the surface 208 on 19 may the epa gave bp 24 160 hours to choose less toxic alternatives to corexit from the list of dispersants on the national contingency plan product schedule and begin applying the new dispersant s within 72 hours of epa approval or provide a detailed reasoning why the approved products did not meet the required standards 231 232 on 20 may us polychemical corporation reportedly received an order from bp for its dispersit spc 1000 dispersant us polychemical said that it could produce 20 000 us gallons 76 160 m 3 a day in the first few days increasing up to 60 000 us gallons 230 160 m 3 a day thereafter 233 also on 20 may bp determined that none of the alternative products met all three criteria of availability toxicity and effectiveness 234 on 24 may epa administrator lisa jackson ordered the epa to conduct its own evaluation of alternatives and ordered bp to scale back dispersant use 235 236 according to analysis of daily dispersant reports provided by the deepwater horizon unified command before 26 may bp used 25 689 us gallons 97 24 160 m 3 a day of corexit after the epa directive the daily average of dispersant use dropped to 23 250 us gallons 88 0 160 m 3 a day a 9 decline 237 the 12 july 2010 bp report listed available stocks of corexit which decreased by over 965 000 us gallons 3 650 160 m 3 without reported application suggesting either stock diversion or unreported application under reported subsea application of 1 690 000 us gallons 6 400 160 m 3 would account for this discrepancy given the suggested dispersant to oil ratio between 1 10 and 1 50 the possible use of 1 69 million us gallons 6 400 160 m 3 in subsea application could be expected to suspend between 0 4 to 2 million barrels 64 000 to 320 000 m 3 of oil below the surface of the gulf citation needed on 31 july rep edward markey chairman of the house energy and environment subcommittee released a letter sent to national incident commander thad allen and documents revealing that the uscg repeatedly allowed bp to use excessive amounts of the dispersant corexit on the surface of the ocean markey s letter based on an analysis conducted by the energy and environment subcommittee staff further showed that by comparing the amounts bp reported using to congress to the amounts contained in the company s requests for exemptions from the ban on surface dispersants it submitted to the uscg that bp often exceeded its own requests with little indication that it informed the uscg or that the uscg attempted to verify whether bp was exceeding approved volumes either bp was lying to congress or to the coast guard about how much dispersants they were shooting onto the ocean said rep markey 238 on 2 august the epa said dispersants did no more harm to the environment than the oil itself and that they stopped a large amount of oil from reaching the coast by making the oil break down faster 220 however independent scientists and epa s own experts continue to voice concerns regarding the use of dispersants 239 edit long term effects of corexit noaa states that toxicity tests have suggested that the acute risk of dispersant oil mixtures is no greater than that of oil alone 217 however some experts believe that all the benefits and costs may not be known for decades 217 a study from georgia tech and universidad autonoma de aguascalientes uaa mexico reported in late 2012 that corexit made the oil up to 52 times more toxic than oil alone 25 240 additionally the dispersant made oil sink faster and more deeply into the beaches and possibly the groundwater 26 241 university of south florida scientists released preliminary results on the toxicity of microscopic drops of oil in the undersea plumes finding that they may be more toxic than previously thought the researchers say the dispersed oil appears to be negatively affecting bacteria and phytoplankton the microscopic plants which make up the basis of the gulf s food web the field based results were consistent with shore based laboratory studies showing that phytoplankton are more sensitive to chemical dispersants than the bacteria which are more sensitive to oil 242 because the dispersants were applied deep under the sea much of the oil never rose to the surface which means it went somewhere else said robert diaz a marine scientist at the college of william and mary the dispersants definitely don t make oil disappear they take it from one area in an ecosystem and put it in another diaz said 215 one plume of dispersed oil measured at 22 miles 35 160 km long more than a mile wide and 650 feet 200 160 m tall the plume showed the oil is persisting for longer periods than we would have expected said researchers with the woods hole oceanographic institution many people speculated that subsurface oil droplets were being easily biodegraded well we didn t find that we found it was still there 243 in a major study on the plume experts found the most worrisome part to be the slow pace at which the oil was breaking down in the cold 40 f 4 c water at depths of 3 000 feet 910 160 m making it a long lasting but unseen threat to vulnerable marine life 244 marine sciences at the university of georgia reported findings of a substantial layer of oily sediment stretching for dozens of miles in all directions from the capped well 131 edit removal dark clouds of smoke and fire emerge as oil burns during a controlled fire in the gulf of mexico may 6 2010 the taiwanese retrofitted skimmer a whale the three basic approaches for removing the oil from the water were burning the oil filtering offshore and collecting for later processing on 28 april 2010 the uscg announced plans to corral and burn off up to 1 000 barrels 160 160 m 3 of oil each day 198 245 in november 2010 the epa reported that situ burning removed as much as template convert musgal of oil from the water there were 411 fires set between april to mid july 2010 from which cancer causing dioxins were released the epa stated that the release was minimal a second research team concluded there was only a small added risk of cancer to people breathing polluted air or eating tainted fish 246 a taiwanese supertanker a whale was retrofitted after the deepwater explosion for skimming large amounts of oil in the gulf 247 the ship was tested in early july 2010 but failed to collect a significant amount of oil 248 due to bp s use of corexit the oil was too dispersed to collect according to a spokesperson for shipowner tmt 249 the epa prohibited the use of skimmers that left more than 15 ppm of oil in the water many large scale skimmers exceeded the limit 250 an urban myth developed that the u s government declined the offers from foreign countries because of the requirements of the jones act 251 this proved untrue and many foreign assets deployed to aid in cleanup efforts 252 in mid june bp ordered 32 160 machines that separate oil and water with each machine capable of extracting up to 2 000 barrels 320 160 m 3 per day 253 254 after testing machines for one week bp decided to use the technology 255 and by 28 june had removed 890 000 barrels 141 000 160 m 3 of oily liquid 256 the uscg said 33 000 000 us gallons 120 000 160 m 3 of tainted water was recovered with 5 000 000 us gallons 19 000 160 m 3 of that consisting of oil bp said 826 800 barrels 131 450 160 m 3 had been recovered or flared 257 edit oil budget the table below presents the noaa estimates based on an estimated release of 4 900 000 barrels 780 000 160 m 3 of oil the category chemically dispersed includes dispersal at the surface and at the wellhead naturally dispersed was mostly at the wellhead residual is the oil remaining as surface sheen floating tarballs and oil washed ashore or buried in sediment however there is plus or minus 10 uncertainty in the total volume of the oil spill 257 258 category estimate alternative 1 alternative 2 direct recovery from wellhead 17 17 17 burned at the surface 5 5 5

browner director of the white house office of energy and climate change policy said they were never meant to be a precise tool and that the data was simply not designed to explain or capable of explaining the fate of the oil oil that the budget classified as dispersed dissolved or evaporate d is not necessarily gone 259 based on these estimates up to 75 of the oil from bp s gulf oil disaster still remained in the gulf environment according to christopher haney chief scientist for defenders of wildlife who called the government report s conclusions misleading haney reiterated terms such as dispersed dissolved and residual do not mean gone that s comparable to saying the sugar dissolved in my coffee is no longer there because i can t see it by director lubchenco s own acknowledgment the oil which is out of sight is not benign whether buried under beaches or settling on the ocean floor residues from the spill will remain toxic for decades 260 appearing before congress bill lehr a senior scientist at noaa s office of response and restoration defended a report written by the national incident command on the fate of the oil the report relied on numbers generated by government and non government oil spill experts using an oil budget calculator obc developed for the spill based upon the obc lehr said 6 was burned and 4 was skimmed but he could not be confident of numbers for the amount collected from beaches as seen in the table above he pointed out that much of the oil has evaporated or been dispersed or dissolved into the water column under questioning from congressman ed markey lehr agreed that the report said the amount of oil that went into the gulf was 4 1 million barrels 650 10 3 160 m 3 noting that 800 000 barrels 130 000 160 m 3 were siphoned off directly from the well noaa was criticized by some independent scientists and congress for the report s conclusions and for failing to explain how the scientists arrived at the calculations detailed in the table above ian macdonald an ocean scientist at fsu claimed the nic report was not science he accused the white house of making sweeping and largely unsupported claims that 3 4 of the oil in the gulf was gone and called the report misleading the imprint will be there in the gulf of mexico for the rest of my life it is not gone and it will not go away quickly he concluded 261 a formally peer reviewed report documenting the obc was scheduled for release in early october 262 markey told lehr the nic report had given the public a false sense of confidence you shouldn t have released it until you knew it was right he said by late july two weeks after the flow of oil had stopped oil on the surface of the gulf had largely dissipated but concern still remained for underwater oil and ecological damage 263 markus huettel a benthic ecologist at fsu who has been studying the spill since 2010 maintains that while much of bp s oil was degraded or evaporated as least 60 remains unaccounted for huettel cautions that only one category from noaa s oil budget the 17 directly recovered from the wellhead is actually known all the other categories like oil burned skimmed chemically dispersed or evaporated are guesses that could change by a factor or two or even more in some cases huettel stressed that even after much research some categories like how much oil was dispersed at depth will never be accurately known that oil is somewhere but nobody knows where and nobody knows how much has settled on the seafloor 264 edit oil eating microbes in august 2010 a study of bacterial activity in the gulf led by terry hazen of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory found a previously unknown bacterial species and reported in the journal science that it was able to break down the oil without depleting oxygen levels 265 hazen s interpretation had its skeptics john kessler a chemical oceanographer at texas a amp m university says what hazen was measuring was a component of the entire hydrocarbon matrix which is a mix of thousands of different molecules although the few molecules described in the new paper in science may well have degraded within weeks kessler says there are others that have much longer half lives on the order of years sometimes even decades 266 he noted that the missing oil has been found in the form of large oil plumes one the size of manhattan quantify which do not appear to be biodegrading very fast 267 by mid september research showed these microbes mainly digested natural gas spewing from the wellhead propane ethane and butane rather than oil according to a subsequent study 268 david l valentine a professor of microbial geochemistry at uc santa barbara said that the oil gobbling properties of the microbes had been grossly overstated 269 methane was the most abundant hydrocarbon released during the spill it has been suggested that vigorous deepwater bacterial bloom respired nearly all the released methane within 4 months leaving behind a residual microbial community containing methanotrophic bacteria 270 some experts suggested that the oil eating bacteria may have caused health issues for residents of the gulf local physicians noted an outbreak of mysterious skin rashes which according to marine toxicologist riki ott could be the result of proliferation of the bacteria in gulf waters in order to eat the oil faster oil eating bacteria like alcanivorax borkumensis has been genetically modified ott claims to have spoken with numerous residents and tourists of the gulf who have experienced symptoms like rashes and peeling palms after contact with the water in the gulf 269 271 edit consequences main article economic and political consequences of the deepwater horizon disaster this section should be summarized and a link

obama dispatched the secretaries of the department of interior and homeland security as well as the epa administrator and noaa to the gulf coast to assess the disaster 272 in his speech on 15 june obama said this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster america has ever faced make no mistake we will fight this spill with everything we ve got for as long as it takes we will make bp pay for the damage their company has caused and we will do whatever s necessary to help the gulf coast and its people recover from this tragedy 273 interior secretary ken salazar has told our job basically is to keep the boot on the neck of british petroleum 274 some observers suggested that the obama administration was being unusually aggressive and often excessive in its criticism of bp which some bp investors saw as an attempt to deflect criticism of his own handling of the crisis republicans such as rand paul accused president obama of being anti business and un american 274 public opinion polls in the u s were generally critical of the way the president obama and the federal government handled the disaster and they were extremely critical of bps response there was a great deal of criticism of bp both in the us and worldwide for its role in the oil spill across the us thousands of people participated in dozens of protests at bp gas stations and other locations 275 276 277 causing sales declines at some stations of between 10 to 40 278 industry responded by saying that disasters are infrequent and that the deepwater horizon is an isolated incident and refuted any claims of a loss of industry wide credibility the american petroleum institute api stated that the offshore drilling industry is important to job creation and economic growth 279 280 ceos from the top five oil companies all agreed that industry needs to work harder at improving safety to help prevent a recurrence of a disaster similar to the deepwater horizon spill api said that they are setting up their own offshore safety institute that will be separate from api s lobbying organization 281 the organization for international investment a washington based advocate for overseas investment into the united states warned that the political rhetoric surrounding the disaster was potentially damaging the reputation of all british companies with operations in the united states and sparked a wave of u s protectionism that restricted british firms from winning government contracts making political donations and lobbying 282 283 edit uk reactions in the uk there was anger at the american press and news outlets for the misuse of the term british petroleum for the company a name which has not been used since british petroleum merged with the american company amoco in 1998 to form bp it was said that the u s was dumping the blame onto the british people and there were calls for british prime minister david cameron to protect british interests in america british pension fund managers who have large holdings of bp shares and rely upon its dividends accepted that while bp had pay compensation for the oil spill and the environmental damage they argued that the cost to the company s market value from the president obama s criticism was far outweighing the direct clean up costs 284 initially bp downplayed the incident its ceo tony hayward called the amount of oil and dispersant relatively tiny in comparison with the very big ocean 285 later he drew an outpouring of criticism when he said that the spill was a disruption to gulf coast residents and himself adding you know i d like my life back 286 bp s chief operating officer doug suttles contradicted the underwater plume discussion noting it may be down to how you define what a plume is here the oil that has been found is in very minute quantities 287 in june bp launched a pr campaign and successfully bid for several search terms related to the oil spill on google and other search engines so that the first sponsored search result linked directly to the company s website 288 289 on 26 july 2010 it was announced that ceo tony hayward was to quit and would be replaced by bob dudley who is an american citizen and previously worked for amoco 290 291 edit international reactions the u s state department listed 70 assistance offers from 23 countries all being initially declined but later 8 had been accepted 292 293 the uscg

possible causes of the explosion was launched on 22 april 2010 by the uscg and the minerals management service 48 on 11 may the united states administration requested the national academy of engineering conduct an independent technical investigation 295 the national commission on the bp deepwater horizon oil spill and offshore drilling was established on 22 may to consider the root causes of the disaster and offer options on safety and environmental precautions 296 the investigation by united states attorney general eric holder was announced on 1 june 297 also the united states house committee on energy and commerce conducted a number of hearings including hearings of tony hayward and heads of anadarko and mitsui s exploration unit 30 298 according to the us congressional investigation the rig s blowout preventer built by cameron international corporation had a hydraulic leak and a failed battery and therefore failed 299 the bp s internal investigation found on 20 april 2010 managers misread pressure data and gave their approval for rig workers to replace drilling fluid in the well with seawater which was not heavy enough to prevent gas that had been leaking into the well from firing up the pipe to the rig causing the explosion the conclusion was that bp was partly to blame as was transocean which owned the rig 28 on 23 march 2011 boemre former mms and the uscg published the forensic examination report on blowout preventer prepared by det norske veritas 300 the report concluded that the primary cause of failure was that the blind shear rams failed to fully close and seal due to a portion of drill pipe trapped between the shearing blocks the national commission on the bp deepwater horizon oil spill and offshore drilling released a final report on 5 january 2011 301 302 the panel found that bp halliburton and transocean had attempted to work more cheaply and thus helped to trigger the explosion and ensuing leakage 303 the report states whether purposeful or not many of the decisions that bp halliburton and transocean made that increased the risk of the macondo blowout clearly saved those companies significant time and money 303 bp released a statement in response to this saying even prior to the conclusion of the commission s investigation bp instituted significant changes designed to further strengthen safety and risk management 304 transocean however blamed bp for making the decisions before the actual explosion occurred and government officials for permitting those decisions 305 halliburton stated that it was acting only upon the orders of bp when it injected the cement into the wall of the well 304 306 halliburton also blamed the governmental officials and bp it criticized bp for its failure to run a cement bond log test 305 in the report bp was accused of nine faults 304 306 one was that it had not used a diagnostic tool to test the strength of the cement 303 another was ignoring a pressure test that had failed 304 still another was for not plugging the pipe with cement 303 the study did not however place the blame on any one of these events rather it concluded with the following statement 304 306 notwithstanding these inherent risks the accident of april 20 was avoidable the panel wrote it resulted from clear mistakes made in the first instance by bp halliburton and transocean and by government officials who relying too much on industry s assertions of the safety of their operations failed to create and apply a program of regulatory oversight that would have properly minimized the risk of deepwater drilling the panel also noted that the government regulators did not have sufficient knowledge or authority to notice these cost cutting decisions 303 the us government report issued in september 2011 stated that bp is ultimately responsibility for the gulf oil spill and that halliburton and transocean share some of the blame 31 307 the report states that the main cause was the defective cement job and halliburton bp and transocean were in different ways responsible for the accident 31 the report states that although the events leading to the sinking of deepwater horizon were set into motion by the failure to prevent a well blowout the investigation revealed numerous systems deficiencies and acts and omissions by transocean and its deepwater horizon crew that had an adverse impact on the ability to prevent or limit the magnitude of the disaster the report also states that a central cause of the blowout was failure of a cement barrier allowing hydrocarbons to flow up the wellbore through the riser and onto the rig resulting in the blowout the loss of life and the subsequent pollution of the gulf of mexico were the result of poor risk management last minute changes to plans failure to observe and respond to critical indicators inadequate well control response and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling at the macondo well and for the operation of the drilling platform edit spill response fund main article gulf coast claims facility see also kenneth feinberg the gulf coast claims facility gccf was the 20 billion fund established by bp to settle claims arising from the deepwater horizon casualty the gccf was announced on 16 june 2010 after meeting of bp executives with president obama 29 30 the fund was established to be used for natural resource damages state and local response costs and individual compensation but could not be used for fines or penalties 30 prior to establishing the gccf emergency compensation was paid by bp from an initial facility 308 the gccf was administrated by attorney kenneth feinberg the facility began accepting claims on 23 august 2010 29 on 8 march 2012 after bp and a team of plaintiffs attorneys agreed to a class action settlement a court supervised administrator patrick juneau took over administration 309 310 until this more than one million claims of 220 000 individual and business claimants were processed and more than 6 2 billion was paid out from the fund 97 of payments were made to claimants in the gulf states 308 in june 2012 the settlement of claims through the gccf was replaced by the court supervised settlement program during this transition period additional 404 million in claims were paid 311 the gccf and its administrator feinberg had been criticized about the amount and speed of payments as well as a lack of transparency 312 an independent audit of the gccf announced by attorney general eric holder was approved by senate on 21 october 2011 313 an auditor bdo consulting found that 7 300 claimants were wrongly denied or underpaid as a result about 64 million of additional payments was made 309 edit litigation and settlements main article deepwater horizon litigation see also hornbeck offshore services llc v salazar by 26 may 2010 over 130 lawsuits relating to the spill had been filed 314 against one or more of bp transocean cameron international corporation and halliburton energy services 315 although it was considered likely by observers that these would be combined into one court as a multidistrict litigation 315 on 21 april 2011 bp issued 40bn worth of lawsuits against rig owner transocean cementer halliburton and blowout preventer manufacturer cameron the oil firm alleged failed safety systems and irresponsible behaviour of contractors had led to the explosion including claims that halliburton failed to properly use modelling software to analyze safe drilling conditions 316 the firms deny the allegations on 2 march 2012 bp and plaintiffs agreed to settle their lawsuits the deal would settle roughly 100 000 claims filled by individuals and businesses affected by the oil spill 317 318 on 13 august bp asked us district judge carl barbier to approve the settlement saying its actions did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct 319 on 13 january 2013 judge barbier approved a medical benefits portion of bp s proposed 7 8 billion partial settlement people living for at least 60 days along oil impacted shores or involved in the clean up who can document one or more specific health conditions caused by the oil or dispersants are eligible for benefits as are those injured during clean up 320 bp also agreed to spend 105 million over five years to set up a gulf coast health outreach program and pay for medical examinations 55 according to a group presenting the plaintiffs the deal has no specific cap 321 bp says that it has 9 5 billion in assets set aside in a trust to pay the claims and the settlement will not increase the 37 2 billion the company budgeted for spill related expenses 317 on 14 november 2012 bp and the us department of justice reached a settlement bp will pay 4 5 billion in fines and other payments the largest of its kind in us history bp also agreed to plead guilty to 11 felony counts related to the deaths of the 11 workers 37 38 the justice department also filed criminal charges against one bp employee in april 2012 and against three bp employees in november 2012 36 322 two employees have been indicted on manslaughter charges for acting negligently in their supervision of key safety tests performed on the rig prior to the explosion and failure to alert onshore engineers of problems in the drilling operation 36 two employees are charged with obstruction of justice and for lying to federal investigators 33 37 322 attorney general eric holder said that the criminal investigation is not yet over and that more company officials could be charged 37 38 in addition the u s government temporary banned bp from new federal contracts over its lack of business integrity 323 324 the plea was accepted by judge sarah vance of the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana on 31 january 2013 325 the settlement includes payments of nearly 2 4 billion to the national fish and wildlife foundation 350 million to the national academy of sciences and about 500 million to the securities and exchange commission bp still faces payouts to thousands of fishermen and businesses harmed by the spill fines under the natural resources damage assessment and payouts to impacted states the settlement has also not resolved what may be the largest penalty related to the spill the fines under the clean water act the potential fine for the spill under the act is 1 100 to 4 300 a barrel spilled meaning the fine could be as much as 21 billion 38 on 3 january 2013 the us justice department announced transocean deepwater inc has agreed to plead guilty to violating the clean water act and to pay a total of 1 4 billion in civil and criminal fines and penalties 326 edit see also
