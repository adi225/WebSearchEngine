right angles to one another perpendicularity and the generalization of this relation into n dimensions and to a variety of mathematical relations thought of as describing non overlapping uncorrelated or independent objects of some kind in computer science orthogonality is the ability to use arbitrary combinations of different features with consistent meanings the concept of orthogonality has been broadly generalized in mathematics science and engineering especially since the beginning of the 16th century much of it has involved the concepts of mathematical functions calculus and linear algebra

references edit etymology the word comes from the greek orthos meaning straight and gonia meaning angle the ancient greek orthog nion lt orthos upright 1 g nia angle 2 and classical latin orthogonium originally denoted a rectangle 3 later they came to mean a right triangle in the 12th century the post classical latin word orthogonalis came to mean a right angle or something related to a right angle 4 edit mathematics orthogonality and rotation of coordinate systems compared between left euclidean space through circular angle right in minkowski spacetime through hyperbolic angle red lines labelled c denote the worldlines of a light signal a vector is orthogonal to itself if it lies on this line 5 edit definitions in geometry two euclidean vectors are orthogonal if they are perpendicular i e they form a right angle curves or functions in the plane are orthogonal at an intersection if their tangent lines are perpendicular at that point two vectors x and y in an inner product space v are orthogonal if their inner product is zero 6 this relationship is denoted two vector subspaces a and b of an inner product space v are called orthogonal subspaces if each vector in a is orthogonal to each vector in b the largest subspace of v that is orthogonal to a given subspace is its orthogonal complement a linear transformation t 160 v v is called an orthogonal linear transformation if it preserves the inner product and thus the angle between and the lengths of vectors that is for all pairs of vectors x and y in the inner product space v a term rewriting system is said to be orthogonal if it is left linear and is non ambiguous orthogonal term rewriting systems are confluent a set of vectors is called pairwise orthogonal if each pairing of them is orthogonal such a set is called an orthogonal set nonzero pairwise orthogonal vectors are always linearly independent in certain cases the word normal is used to mean orthogonal particularly in the geometric sense as in the normal to a surface for example the y axis is normal to the curve y x 2 at the origin however normal may also refer to the magnitude of a vector in particular a set is called orthonormal orthogonal plus normal if it is an orthogonal set of unit vectors as a result use of the term normal to mean orthogonal is often avoided the word normal also has a different meaning in probability and statistics a vector space with a bilinear form generalizes the case of an inner product when the bilinear form applied to two vectors results in zero then they are orthogonal the case of a pseudo euclidean plane uses the term hyperbolic orthogonality in the diagram axes x and t are hyperbolic orthogonal for any given edit euclidean vector spaces in 2 d or higher dimensional euclidean space two vectors are orthogonal if and only if their dot product is zero i e they make an angle of 90 or 2 radians 7 hence orthogonality of vectors is an extension of the concept of perpendicular vectors into higher dimensional spaces in terms of euclidean subspaces the orthogonal complement of a line is the plane perpendicular to it and vice versa 8 note however that there is no correspondence with regards to perpendicular planes because vectors in subspaces start from the origin definition of vector subspace in four dimensional euclidean space the orthogonal complement of a line is a hyperplane and vice versa and that of a plane is a plane 8 edit orthogonal functions main article orthogonal functions by using integral calculus it is common to use the following to define the inner product of two functions f and g here we introduce a nonnegative weight function in the definition of this inner product in simple cases w x 1 exactly we say that these functions are orthogonal if that inner product is zero we write the norms with respect to this inner product and the weight function as the members of a set of functions f i 160 i 1 2 3 are orthogonal on the closed interval a b if orthonormal on the interval a b if where is the kronecker delta function in other words any two of them are orthogonal and the norm of each is 1 in the case of the orthonormal sequence see in particular the orthogonal polynomials edit examples the vectors 1 3 2 3 1 0 1 3 1 5 3 are orthogonal to each other since 1 3 3 1 2 0 0 3 1 3 1 1 0 5 3 0 and 1 1 3 3 1 2 5 3 0 the vectors 1 0 1 0 t and 0 1 0 1 t are orthogonal to each other the dot product of these vectors is 0 we can then make the generalization to consider the vectors in z 2 n for some positive integer a and for 1 k a 1 these vectors are orthogonal for example 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 t 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 t 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 t are orthogonal take two quadratic functions 2 t 3 and 5 t 2 t 17 9 these functions are orthogonal with respect to a unit weight function on the interval from 1 to 1 the product of these two functions is 10 t 3 17 t 2 7 9 t 17 3 and now the functions 1 sin nx cos nx 160 n 1 2 3 are orthogonal with respect to riemann integration on the intervals 0 2 or any other closed interval of length 2 this fact is a central one in fourier series edit orthogonal polynomials various polynomial sequences named for mathematicians of the past are sequences of orthogonal polynomials in particular the hermite polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the gaussian distribution with zero mean value the legendre polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the uniform distribution on the interval 1 1 the laguerre polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the exponential distribution somewhat more general laguerre polynomial sequences are orthogonal with respect to gamma distributions the chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are orthogonal with respect to the measure the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind are orthogonal with respect to the wigner semicircle distribution edit orthogonal states in quantum mechanics in quantum mechanics two eigenstates of a hermitian operator and are orthogonal if they correspond to different eigenvalues this means in dirac notation that unless and correspond to the same eigenvalue this follows from the fact that schr dinger s equation is a sturm liouville equation in schr dinger s formulation or that observables are given by hermitian operators in heisenberg s formulation citation needed edit art and architecture in art the perspective imagined lines pointing to the vanishing point are referred to as orthogonal lines the term orthogonal line often has a quite different meaning in the literature of modern art criticism many works by painters such as piet mondrian and burgoyne diller are noted for their exclusive use of orthogonal lines not however with reference to perspective but rather referring to lines that are straight and exclusively horizontal or vertical forming right angles where they intersect for example an essay at the web site of the thyssen bornemisza museum states that mondrian dedicated his entire oeuvre to the investigation of the balance between orthogonal lines and primary colours 1 edit computer science orthogonality in programming language design is the ability to use various language features in arbitrary combinations with consistent results 9 this usage was introduced by von wijngaarten in the design of algol 68 the number of independent primitive concepts has been minimized in order that the language be easy to describe to learn and to implement on the other hand these concepts have been applied orthogonally in order to maximize the expressive power of the language while trying to avoid deleterious superfluities 10 orthogonality is a system design property which guarantees that modifying the technical effect produced by a component of a system neither creates nor propagates side effects to other components of the system typically this is achieved through the separation of concerns and encapsulation and it is essential for feasible and compact designs of complex systems the emergent behavior of a system consisting of components should be controlled strictly by formal definitions of its logic and not by side effects resulting from poor integration i e nonorthogonal design of modules and interfaces orthogonality reduces testing and development time because it is easier to verify designs that neither cause side effects nor depend on them for example a car has orthogonal components and controls e g accelerating the vehicle does not influence anything else but the components involved exclusively with the acceleration function on the other hand a nonorthogonal design might have its steering influence its braking e g electronic stability control or its speed tweak its suspension 11 consequently this usage is seen to be derived from the use of orthogonal in mathematics one may project a vector onto a subspace by projecting it onto each member of a set of basis vectors separately and adding the projections if and only if the basis vectors are mutually orthogonal an instruction set is said to be orthogonal if it lacks redundancy i e there is only a single instruction that can be used to accomplish a given task 12 and is designed such that instructions can use any register in any addressing mode this terminology results from considering an instruction as a vector whose components are the instruction fields one field identifies the registers to be operated upon and another specifies the addressing mode an orthogonal instruction set uniquely encodes all combinations of registers and addressing modes citation needed edit communications in communications multiple access schemes are orthogonal when an ideal receiver can completely reject arbitrarily strong unwanted signals from the desired signal using different basis functions one such scheme is tdma where the orthogonal basis functions are nonoverlapping rectangular pulses time slots another scheme is orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ofdm which refers to the use by a single transmitter of a set of frequency multiplexed signals with the exact minimum frequency spacing needed to make them orthogonal so that they do not interfere with each other well known examples include a g and n versions of 802 11 wi fi wimax itu t g hn dvb t the terrestrial digital tv broadcast system used in most of the world outside north america and dmt discrete multi tone the standard form of adsl in ofdm the subcarrier frequencies are chosen so that the subcarriers are orthogonal to each other meaning that crosstalk between the subchannels is eliminated and intercarrier guard bands are not required this greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver unlike in conventional fdm a separate filter for each subchannel is not required edit statistics econometrics and economics when performing statistical analysis independent variables that affect a particular dependent variable are said to be orthogonal if they are uncorrelated 13 since the covariance forms an inner product in this case the same results are obtained for the effect of any of the independent variables upon the dependent variable regardless of whether one models the effects of the variables individually with simple regression or simultaneously with multiple regression if correlation is present the factors are not orthogonal and different results are obtained by the two methods this usage arises from the fact that if centered by subtracting the expected value the mean uncorrelated variables are orthogonal in the geometric sense discussed above both as observed data i e vectors and as random variables i e density functions one econometric formalism that is alternative to the maximum likelihood framework the generalized method of moments relies on orthogonality conditions in particular the ordinary least squares estimator may be easily derived from an orthogonality condition between predicted dependent variables and model residuals edit taxonomy in taxonomy an orthogonal classification is one in which no item is a member of more than one group that is the classifications are mutually exclusive edit combinatorics in combinatorics two n n latin squares are said to be orthogonal if their superimposition yields all possible n 2 combinations of entries 14 edit chemistry in synthetic organic chemistry orthogonal protection is a strategy allowing the deprotection of functional groups independently of each other edit system reliability in the field of system reliability orthogonal redundancy is that form of redundancy where the form of backup device or method is completely different from the prone to error device or method the failure mode of an orthogonally redundant back up device or method does not intersect with and is completely different from the failure mode of the device or method in need of redundancy to safeguard the total system against catastrophic failure edit neuroscience in neuroscience a sensory map in the brain which has overlapping stimulus coding e g location and quality is called an orthogonal map edit gaming in board games such as chess which feature a grid of squares orthogonal is commonly used to mean in the same row or column in this context orthogonal and diagonal are considered opposites 15 edit see also look up orthogonal in wiktionary the free dictionary orthogonalization gram
