the topic based vector space model tvsm 1 literature 1 extends the vector space model of information retrieval by removing the constraint that the term vectors be orthogonal the assumption of orthogonal terms is incorrect regarding natural languages which causes problems with synonyms and strong related terms this facilitates the use of stopword lists stemming and thesaurus in tvsm in contrast to the generalized vector space model the tvsm does not depend on concurrence based similarities between terms contents 1 definitions 2 enhanced topic based vector space model 3 implementations 4 references edit definitions the basic premise of tvsm is the existence of a d dimensional space r with only positive axis intercepts i e r in r and d in n each dimension of r represents a fundamental topic a term vector t has a specific weight for a certain r to calculate these weights assumptions are made taking into account the document contents ideally important terms will have a high weight and stopwords and irrelevants terms to the topic will have a low weight the tvsm document model is obtained as a sum of term vectors representing terms in the document the similarity between two documents di and dj is defined as the scalar product of document vectors edit enhanced topic based vector space model the enhancement of the enhanced topic based vector space model etvsm 2 literature 2 is a proposal on how to derive term vectors from an ontology using a synonym ontology created from wordnet kuropka shows good results for document similarity if a trivial ontology is used the results are similar to vector space model edit implementations implementation of etvsm in python edit references dominik kuropka jorg becker 2003 topic based vector space model http www kuropka net files tvsm pdf dominik kuropka artem polyvyanyy 2007 a quantitative evaluation of the enhanced topic based vector space model http kuropka net files hpi evaluation of etvsm pdf
