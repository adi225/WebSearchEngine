documents and any additional content that may be included by a document such as images style sheets and scripts a user agent commonly a web browser or web crawler initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using http and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message if unable to do so the resource is typically a real file on the server s secondary storage but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is implemented while the primary function is to serve content a full implementation of http also includes ways of receiving content from clients this feature is used for submitting web forms including uploading of files many generic web servers also support server side scripting using active server pages asp php or other scripting languages this means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files while the actual server software remains unchanged usually this function is used to create html documents dynamically on the fly as opposed to returning static documents the former is primarily used for retrieving and or modifying information from databases the latter is typically much faster and more easily cached web servers are not always used for serving the world wide web they can also be found embedded in devices such as printers routers webcams and serving only a local network the web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring and or administering the device in question this usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required which now is included with most operating systems edit history the world s first web server a next computer workstation with ethernet 1990 the case label reads this machine is a server do not power it down in 1989 tim berners lee proposed a new project to his employer cern with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system the project resulted in berners lee writing two programs in 1990 a browser called worldwideweb the world s first web server later known as cern httpd which ran on nextstep between 1991 and 1994 the simplicity and effectiveness of early technologies used to surf and exchange data through the world wide web helped to port them to many different operating systems and spread their use among scientific organizations and universities and then to industry in 1994 tim berners lee decided to constitute the world wide web consortium w3c to regulate the further development of the many technologies involved http html etc through a standardization process edit common features virtual hosting to serve many web sites using one ip address large file support to be able to serve files whose size is greater than 2 160 gb on 32 bit os bandwidth throttling to limit the speed of responses in order to not saturate the network and to be able to serve more clients server side scripting to generate dynamic web pages still keeping web server and website implementations separate from each other edit path translation web servers are able to map the path component of a uniform resource locator url into a local file system resource for static requests an internal or external program name for dynamic requests for a static request the url path specified by the client is relative to the web server s root directory consider the following url as it would be requested by a client http www example com path file html the client s user agent will translate it into a connection to www example com with the following http 1 1 request get path file html http 1 1 host www example com the web server on www example com will append the given path to the path of its root directory on an apache server this is commonly home www on unix machines usually var www the result is the local file system resource home www path file html the web server then reads the file if it exists and sends a response to the client s web browser the response will describe the content of the file and contain the file itself or an error message will return saying that the file does not exist or is unavailable edit kernel mode and user mode web servers a web server can be either implemented into the os kernel or in user space like other regular applications an in kernel web server like tux on gnu linux or microsoft iis on windows will usually work faster because as part of the system it can directly use all the hardware resources it needs such as non paged memory cpu time slices network adapters or buffers web servers that run in user mode have to ask the system for permission to use more memory or more cpu resources not only do these requests to the kernel take time but they are not always satisfied because the system reserves resources for its own usage and has the responsibility to share hardware resources with all the other running applications also applications cannot access the system s internal buffers which causes useless buffer copies that create another handicap for user mode web servers as a consequence the only way for a user mode web server to match kernel mode performance is to raise the quality of its code to much higher standards similar to that of the code used in web servers that run in the kernel this is a significant issue under windows where the user mode overhead is about six times greater than that under linux 2 edit load limits a web server program has defined load limits because it can handle only a limited number of concurrent client connections usually between 2 and 80 000 by default between 500 and 1 000 per ip address and tcp port and it can serve only a certain maximum number of requests per second depending on its own settings the http request type whether the content is static or dynamic whether the content is cached and the hardware and software limitations of the os of the computer on which the web server runs when a web server is near to or over its limits it becomes unresponsive edit causes of overload at any time web servers can be overloaded because of too much legitimate web traffic thousands or even millions of clients connecting to the web site in a short interval e g slashdot effect distributed denial of service attacks a denial of service attack dos attack or distributed denial of service attack ddos attack is an attempt to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users computer worms that sometimes cause abnormal traffic because of millions of infected computers not coordinated among them xss viruses can cause high traffic because of millions of infected browsers and or web servers internet bots traffic not filtered limited on large web sites with very few resources bandwidth etc internet network slowdowns so that client requests are served more slowly and the number of connections increases so much that server limits are reached web servers computers partial unavailability this can happen because of required or urgent maintenance or upgrade hardware or software failures back end e g database failures etc in these cases the remaining web servers get too much traffic and become overloaded edit symptoms of overload the symptoms of an overloaded web server are requests are served with possibly long delays from 1 second to a few hundred seconds the web server returns an http error code such as 500 502 503 504 408 or even 404 which is inappropriate for an overload condition the web server refuses or resets interrupts tcp connections before it returns any content in very rare cases the web server returns only a part of the requested content this behavior can be considered a bug even if it usually arises as a symptom of overload edit anti overload techniques to partially overcome above load limits and to prevent overload most popular web sites use common techniques like managing network traffic by using firewalls to block unwanted traffic coming from bad ip sources or having bad patterns http traffic managers to drop redirect or rewrite requests having bad http patterns bandwidth management and traffic shaping in order to smooth down peaks in network usage deploying web cache techniques using different domain names to serve different static and dynamic content by separate web servers i e http images example com http www example com using different domain names and or computers to separate big files from small and medium sized files the idea is to be able to fully cache small and medium sized files and to efficiently serve big or huge over 10 1000 mb files by using different settings using many web servers programs per computer each one bound to its own network card and ip address using many web servers computers that are grouped together so that they act or are seen as one big web server see also load balancer adding more hardware resources i e ram disks to each computer tuning os parameters for hardware capabilities and usage using more efficient computer programs for web servers etc using other workarounds especially if dynamic content is involved edit market share market share of major
