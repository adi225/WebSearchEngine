binary or binomial classification is the task of classifying the members of a given set of objects into two groups on the basis of whether they have some property or not some typical binary classification tasks are medical testing to determine if a patient has certain disease or not the classification property is the presence of the disease quality control in factories i e deciding if a new product is good enough to be sold or if it should be discarded the classification property is being good enough deciding whether a page or an article should be in the result set of a search or not the classification property is the relevance of the article or the usefulness to the user statistical classification in general is one of the problems studied in computer science in order to automatically learn classification systems some methods suitable for learning binary classifiers include the decision trees bayesian networks support vector machines and neural networks sometimes classification tasks are trivial given 100 balls some of them red and some blue a human with normal color vision can easily separate them into red ones and blue ones however some tasks like those in practical medicine and those interesting from the computer science point of view are far from trivial and may produce faulty results if executed imprecisely contents 1 hypothesis testing 2 evaluation

statistical hypothesis testing the tester starts with a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis performs an experiment and then decides whether to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis testing is therefore a binary classification of the hypothesis under study a positive or statistically significant result is one which rejects the null hypothesis doing this when the null hypothesis is in fact true a false positive is a type i error doing this when the null hypothesis is false results in a true positive a negative or not statistically significant result is one which does not reject the null hypothesis doing this when the null hypothesis is in fact false a false negative is a type ii error doing this when the null hypothesis is true results in a true negative edit evaluation of binary classifiers see also sensitivity and specificity precision and recall from the confusion matrix you can derive four basic measures to measure the performance of a medical test the concepts sensitivity and specificity are often used these concepts are readily usable for the evaluation of any binary classifier say we test some people for the presence of a disease some of these people have the disease and our test says they are positive they are called true positives tp some have the disease but the test claims they don t they are called false negatives fn some don t have the disease and the test says they don t true negatives tn finally there might be healthy people who have a positive test result false positives fp thus the number of true positives false negatives true negatives and false positives add up to 100 of the set specificity tnr is the proportion of people that tested negative tn of all the people that actually are negative tn fp as with sensitivity it can be looked at as the probability that the test result is negative given that the patient is not sick with higher specificity fewer healthy people are labeled as sick or in the factory case the less money the factory loses by discarding good products instead of selling them sensitivity tpr is the proportion of people that tested positive tp of all the people that actually are positive tp fn it can be seen as the probability that the test is positive given that the patient is sick with higher sensitivity fewer actual cases of disease go undetected or in the case of the factory quality control the fewer faulty products go to the market the relationship between sensitivity and specificity as well as the performance of the classifier can be visualized and studied using the roc curve in theory sensitivity and specificity are independent in the sense that it is possible to achieve 100 in both such as in the red blue ball example given above in more practical less contrived instances however there is usually a trade off such that they are inversely proportional to one another to some extent this is because we rarely measure the actual thing we would like to classify rather we generally measure an indicator of the thing we would like to classify referred to as a surrogate marker the reason why 100 is achievable in the ball example is because redness and blueness is determined by directly detecting redness and blueness however indicators are sometimes compromised such as when non indicators mimic indicators or when indicators are time dependent only becoming evident after a certain lag time the following example of a pregnancy test will make use of such an indicator modern pregnancy tests do not use the pregnancy itself to determine pregnancy status rather human chorionic gonadotropin is used or hcg present in the urine of gravid females as a surrogate marker to indicate that a woman is pregnant because hcg can also be produced by a tumor the specificity of modern pregnancy tests cannot be 100 in that false positives are possible also because hcg is present in the urine in such small concentrations after fertilization and early embryogenesis the sensitivity of modern pregnancy tests cannot be 100 in that false negatives are possible in addition to sensitivity and specificity the performance of a binary classification test can be measured with positive ppv and negative predictive values npv the positive prediction value answers the question if the test result is positive how well does that predict an actual presence of disease it is calculated as true positives true positives false positives that is it is the proportion of true positives out of all positive results the negative prediction value is the same but for negatives naturally there is one crucial difference between the two concepts sensitivity and specificity are independent from the population in the sense that they do not change depending on the tested proportion of positives and negatives indeed the sensitivity of the test can be determined by testing only positive cases however the prediction values are dependent on the population edit example as an example suppose there is a test for a disease with 99 sensitivity and 99 specificity if 2000 people are tested 1000 of them are sick and 1000 of them are healthy about 990 true positives 990 true negatives are likely with 10 false positives and 10 false negatives the positive and negative prediction values would be 99 so there can be high confidence in the result however if of the 2000 people only 100 are really sick the likely result is 99 true positives 1 false negative 1881 true negatives and 19 false positives of the 19 99 people tested positive only 99 really have the disease that means intuitively that given that a patient s test result is positive there is only 84 chance that he or she really has the disease on the other hand given that the patient s test result is negative there is only 1 chance in 1882 or 0 05 probability that the patient has the disease despite the test result edit measuring a classifier with sensitivity and specificity suppose you are training your own classifier and you wish to measure its performance using the well accepted metrics of sensitivity and specificity it may be instructive to compare your classifier to a random classifier that flips a coin based on the prevalence of a disease suppose that the probability a person has the disease is and the probability that they do not is suppose then that we have a random classifier that guesses that you have the disease with that same probability and guesses you do not with the same probability the probability of a true positive is the probability that you have the disease and the random classifier guesses that you do or with similar reasoning the probability of a false negative is from the definitions above the sensitivity of this classifier is with more similar reasoning we can calculate the specificity as so while the measure itself is independent of disease prevalence the performance of this random classifier depends on disease prevalence your classifier may have performance that is like this random classifier but with a better weighted coin higher sensitivity and specificity so these measures may be influenced by disease prevalence an alternative measure of performance is the matthews correlation coefficient for which any random classifier will get an average score of 0 edit converting continuous values to binary tests whose results are of continuous values such as most blood values can artificially be made binary by defining a cutoff value with test results being designated as positive or negative depending on whether the resultant value is higher or lower than the cutoff however such conversion causes a loss of information as the resultant binary classification does not tell how much above or below the cutoff a value is as a result when converting a continuous value that is close to the cutoff to a binary one the resultant positive or negative predictive value is generally higher than the predictive value given directly from the continuous value in such cases the designation of the test of being either positive or negative gives the appearance of an inappropriately high certainty while the value is in fact in an interval of uncertainty for example with the urine concentration of hcg as a continuous value a urine pregnancy test that measured 52 miu ml of hcg may show as positive with 50 miu ml as cutoff but is in fact in an interval of uncertainty which may be apparent only by knowing the original continuous value on the other hand a test result very far from the cutoff generally has a resultant positive or negative predictive value that is lower than the predictive value given from the continuous value for example a urine hcg value of 200 000 miu ml confers a very high probability of pregnancy but conversion to binary values results in that it shows just as positive as the one of 52 miu ml edit see also multiclass classification multi label classification one class
