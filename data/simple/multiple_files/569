a system architecture or systems architecture is the conceptual model that defines the structure behavior and more views of a system an architecture description is a formal description and representation of a system organized in a way that supports reasoning about the structure of the system which comprises system components the externally visible properties of those components the relationships e g the behavior between them and provides a plan from which products can be procured and systems developed that will work together to implement the overall system the language for architecture description is called the architecture description language adl contents 1 history 2 types 3 see also 4 references 5 additional references 6 external links edit history it is important to keep in mind that the modern systems architecture did not appear out of nowhere systems architecture depends heavily on practices and techniques which were developed over thousands of years in many other fields perhaps the most important being civil architecture prior to the advent of digital computers the electronics and other engineering disciplines used the term system as it is still commonly used today however with the arrival of digital computers and the development of software engineering as a separate discipline it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered hardware artifacts software artifacts and the combined artifacts a programmable hardware artifact or computing machine that lacks its software program is impotent even as a software artifact or program is equally impotent unless it can be used to alter the sequential states of a suitable hardware machine however a hardware machine and its software program can be designed to perform an almost illimitable number of abstract and physical tasks within the computer and software engineering disciplines and often other engineering disciplines such as communications then the term system came to be defined as containing all of the elements necessary which generally includes both hardware and software to perform a useful function consequently within these engineering disciplines a system generally refers to a programmable hardware machine and its included program and a systems engineer is defined as one concerned with the complete device both hardware and software and more particularly all of the interfaces of the device including that between hardware and software and especially between the complete device and its user the chi the hardware engineer deals more or less exclusively with the hardware device the software engineer deals more or less exclusively with the software program and the systems engineer is responsible for seeing that the software program is capable of properly running within the hardware device and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment especially the user and performing its intended function by analogy then a systems architecture makes use of elements of both software and hardware and is used to enable design of such a composite system a good architecture may be viewed as a partitioning scheme or algorithm which partitions all of the system s present and foreseeable requirements into a workable set of cleanly bounded subsystems with nothing left over that is it is a partitioning scheme which is exclusive inclusive and exhaustive a major purpose of the partitioning is to arrange the elements in the sub systems so that there is a minimum of communications needed among them in both software and hardware a good sub system tends to be seen to be a meaningful object moreover a good architecture provides for an easy mapping to the user s requirements and the validation tests of the user s requirements ideally a mapping also exists from every least element to every requirement and test edit types this section requires expansion july 2012 several types of
