removed february 2013 visualization of how a car deforms in an asymmetrical crash using finite element analysis visualization is any technique for creating images diagrams or animations to communicate a message visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of man examples from history include cave paintings egyptian hieroglyphs greek geometry and leonardo da vinci s revolutionary methods of technical drawing for engineering and scientific purposes visualization today has ever expanding applications in science education engineering e g product visualization interactive multimedia medicine etc typical of a visualization application is the field of computer graphics the invention of computer graphics may be the most important development in visualization since the invention of central perspective in the renaissance period the development of animation also helped advance visualization contents 1 overview

geographia circa 150 indicating the countries of serica and sinae china at the extreme right beyond the island of taprobane sri lanka oversized and the aurea chersonesus southeast asian peninsula charles minard s information graphic of napoleon s march the use of visualization to present information is not a new phenomenon it has been used in maps scientific drawings and data plots for over a thousand years examples from cartography include ptolemy s geographia 2nd century ad a map of china 1137 ad and minard s map 1861 of napoleon s invasion of russia a century and a half ago most of the concepts learned in devising these images carry over in a straight forward manner to computer visualization edward tufte has written three critically acclaimed books that explain many of these principles 1 2 3 computer graphics has from its beginning been used to study scientific problems however in its early days the lack of graphics power often limited its usefulness the recent emphasis on visualization started in 1987 with the special issue of computer graphics on visualization in scientific computing citation needed since then there have been several conferences and workshops co sponsored by the ieee computer society and acm siggraph devoted to the general topic and special areas in the field for example volume visualization most people are familiar with the digital animations produced to present meteorological data during weather reports on television though few can distinguish between those models of reality and the satellite photos that are also shown on such programs tv also offers scientific visualizations when it shows computer drawn and animated reconstructions of road or airplane accidents some of the most popular examples of scientific visualizations are computer generated images that show real spacecraft in action out in the void far beyond earth or on other planets citation needed dynamic forms of visualization such as educational animation or timelines have the potential to enhance learning about systems that change over time apart from the distinction between interactive visualizations and animation the most useful categorization is probably between abstract and model based scientific visualizations the abstract visualizations show completely conceptual constructs in 2d or 3d these generated shapes are completely arbitrary the model based visualizations either place overlays of data on real or digitally constructed images of reality or make a digital construction of a real object directly from the scientific data scientific visualization is usually done with specialized software though there are a few exceptions noted below some of these specialized programs have been released as open source software having very often its origins in universities within an academic environment where sharing software tools and giving access to the source code is common there are also many proprietary software packages of scientific visualization tools models and frameworks for building visualizations include the data flow models popularized by systems such as avs iris explorer and vtk toolkit and data state models in spreadsheet systems such as the spreadsheet for visualization and spreadsheet for images edit applications of visualization a scientific visualization of an extremely large simulation of a raleigh taylor instability caused by two mixing fluids as a subject in computer science scientific visualization is the use of interactive sensory representations typically visual of abstract data to reinforce cognition hypothesis building and reasoning data visualization is a related subcategory of visualization dealing with statistical graphics and geographic or spatial data as in thematic cartography that is abstracted in schematic form 4 5 edit scientific visualization scientific visualization is the transformation selection or representation of data from simulations or experiments with an implicit or explicit geometric structure to allow the exploration analysis and understanding of the data scientific visualization focuses and emphasizes the representation of higher order data using primarily graphics and animation techniques 6 7 it is a very important part of visualization and maybe the first one as the visualization of experiments and phenomena is as old as science itself traditional areas of scientific visualization are flow visualization medical visualization astrophysical visualization and chemical visualization there are several different techniques to visualize scientific data with isosurface reconstruction and direct volume rendering being the more common edit educational visualization educational visualization is using a simulation normally created on a computer to create an image of something so it can be taught about this is very useful when teaching about a topic that is difficult to otherwise see for example atomic structure because atoms are far too small to be studied easily without expensive and difficult to use scientific equipment it can also be used to view past events such as looking at dinosaurs or looking at things that are difficult or fragile to look at in reality like the human skeleton edit information visualization information visualization concentrates on the use of computer supported tools to explore large amount of abstract data the term information visualization was originally coined by the user interface research group at xerox parc and included dr jock mackinlay citation needed practical application of information visualization in computer programs involves selecting transforming and representing abstract data in a form that facilitates human interaction for exploration and understanding important aspects of information visualization are dynamics of visual representation and the interactivity strong techniques enable the user to modify the visualization in real time thus affording unparalleled perception of patterns and structural relations in the abstract data in question edit knowledge visualization the use of visual representations to transfer knowledge between at least two persons aims to improve the transfer of knowledge by using computer and non computer based visualization methods complementarily 8 examples of such visual formats are sketches diagrams images objects interactive visualizations information visualization applications and imaginary visualizations as in stories while information visualization concentrates on the use of computer supported tools to derive new insights knowledge visualization focuses on transferring insights and creating new knowledge in groups beyond the mere transfer of facts knowledge visualization aims to further transfer insights experiences attitudes values expectations perspectives opinions and predictions by using various complementary visualizations see also picture dictionary visual dictionary edit product visualization product visualization involves visualization software technology for the viewing and manipulation of 3d models technical drawing and other related documentation of manufactured components and large assemblies of products it is a key part of product lifecycle management product visualization software typically provides high levels of photorealism so that a product can be viewed before it is actually manufactured this supports functions ranging from design and styling to sales and marketing technical visualization is an important aspect of product development originally technical drawings were made by hand but with the rise of advanced computer graphics the drawing board has been replaced by computer aided design cad cad drawings and models have several advantages over hand made drawings such as the possibility of 3 d modeling rapid prototyping and simulation edit systems visualization systems visualization is a new field of visualization which integrates and subsumes existing visualization methodologies and adds to it narrative story telling visual metaphors from the field of advertising and visual design it also recognizes the importance of complex systems theory the interconnections of systems of systems and the need of knowledge representation through ontologies 9 10 systems visualization provides a viewer of systems visualization the ability to quickly understand the complexity of a system unlike other visualization approaches such as data visualization information visualization flow visualization scientific visualization and network visualization which focus mainly on data representation systems visualization seeks to provide new way to visualize complex systems of systems through an integrative approach edit visual communication visual communication is the communication of ideas through the visual display of information primarily associated with two dimensional images it includes alphanumerics art signs and electronic resources recent research in the field has focused on web design and graphically oriented usability edit visual analytics visual analytics focuses on human interaction with visualization systems as part of a larger process of data analysis visual analytics has been defined as the science of analytical reasoning supported by the interactive visual interface 11 its focus is on human information discourse interaction within massive dynamically changing information spaces visual analytics research concentrates on support for perceptual and cognitive operations that enable users to detect the expected and discover the unexpected in complex information spaces technologies resulting from visual analytics find their application in almost all fields but are being driven by critical needs and funding in biology and national security edit visualization techniques the following are examples of some common visualization techniques isosurfaces direct volume rendering streamlines streaklines and pathlines
