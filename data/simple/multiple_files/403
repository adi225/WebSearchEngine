nodes etc of a computer 1 2 or biological network 3 essentially it is the topological 4 structure of a network and may be depicted physically or logically physical topology refers to the placement of the network s various components including device location and cable installation while logical topology shows how data flows within a network regardless of its physical design distances between nodes physical interconnections transmission rates and or signal types may differ between two networks yet their topologies may be identical a good example is a local area network lan any given node in the lan has one or more physical links to other devices in the network graphically mapping these links results in a geometric shape that can be used to describe the physical topology of the network conversely mapping the data flow between the components determines the logical topology of the network contents 1 topology 1 1 point to point 1 2 bus 1 3 star 1 4 ring 1 5 mesh 1 6 tree 1 7 hybrid 1 8 daisy chain 2 centralization 3 decentralization 4 see also 5 references 6 external links edit topology there are two basic categories of network topologies 5 physical topologies logical topologies the shape of the cabling layout used to link devices is called the physical topology of the network this refers to the layout of cabling the locations of nodes and the interconnections between the nodes and the cabling 1 the physical topology of a network is determined by the capabilities of the network access devices and media the level of control or fault tolerance desired and the cost associated with cabling or telecommunications circuits the logical topology in contrast is the way that the signals act on the network media or the way that the data passes through the network from one device to the next without regard to the physical interconnection of the devices a network s logical topology is not necessarily the same as its physical topology for example the original twisted pair ethernet using repeater hubs was a logical bus topology with a physical star topology layout token ring is a logical ring topology but is wired a physical star from the media access unit the logical classification of network topologies generally follows the same classifications as those in the physical classifications of network topologies but describes the path that the data takes between nodes being used as opposed to the actual physical connections between nodes the logical topologies are generally determined by network protocols as opposed to being determined by the physical layout of cables wires and network devices or by the flow of the electrical signals although in many cases the paths that the electrical signals take between nodes may closely match the logical flow of data hence the convention of using the terms logical topology and signal topology interchangeably logical topologies are often closely associated with media access control methods and protocols logical topologies are able to be dynamically reconfigured by special types of equipment such as routers and switches diagram of different network topologies the study of network topology recognizes eight basic topologies 6 point to point bus star ring or circular mesh tree hybrid daisy chain edit point to point the simplest topology is a permanent link between two endpoints switched point to point topologies are the basic model of conventional telephony the value of a permanent point to point network is unimpeded communications between the two endpoints the value of an on demand point to point connection is proportional to the number of potential pairs of subscribers and has been expressed as metcalfe s law permanent dedicated easiest to understand of the variations of point to point topology is a point to point communications channel that appears to the user to be permanently associated with the two endpoints a children s tin can telephone is one example of a physical dedicated channel within many switched telecommunications systems it is possible to establish a permanent circuit one example might be a telephone in the lobby of a public building which is programmed to ring only the number of a telephone dispatcher nailing down a switched connection saves the cost of running a physical circuit between the two points the resources in such a connection can be released when no longer needed for example a television circuit from a parade route back to the studio switched using circuit switching or packet switching technologies a point to point circuit can be set up dynamically and dropped when no longer needed this is the basic mode of conventional telephony edit bus main article bus network bus network topology in local area networks where bus topology is used each node is connected to a single cable each computer or server is connected to the single bus cable a signal from the source travels in both directions to all machines connected on the bus cable until it finds the intended recipient if the machine address does not match the intended address for the data the machine ignores the data alternatively if the data matches the machine address the data is accepted since the bus topology consists of only one wire it is rather inexpensive to implement when compared to other topologies however the low cost of implementing the technology is offset by the high cost of managing the network additionally since only one cable is utilized it can be the single point of failure if the network cable is terminated on both ends and when without termination data transfer stop and when cable breaks the entire network will be down linear bus the type of network topology in which all of the nodes of the network are connected to a common transmission medium which has exactly two endpoints this is the bus which is also commonly referred to as the backbone or trunk 160 all data that is transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over this common transmission medium and is able to be received by all nodes in the network simultaneously 1 note the two endpoints of the common transmission medium are normally terminated with a device called a terminator that exhibits the characteristic impedance of the transmission medium and which dissipates or absorbs the energy that remains in the signal to prevent the signal from being reflected or propagated back onto the transmission medium in the opposite direction which would cause interference with and degradation of the signals on the transmission medium distributed bus the type of network topology in which all of the nodes of the network are connected to a common transmission medium which has more than two endpoints that are created by adding branches to the main section of the transmission medium 160 the physical distributed bus topology functions in exactly the same fashion as the physical linear bus topology i e all nodes share a common transmission medium notes all of the endpoints of the common transmission medium are normally terminated using 50 ohm resistor the linear bus topology is sometimes considered to be a special case of the distributed bus topology 160 i e a distributed bus with no branching segments the physical distributed bus topology is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a physical tree topology 160 however although the physical distributed bus topology resembles the physical tree topology it differs from the physical tree topology in that there is no central node to which any other nodes are connected since this hierarchical functionality is replaced by the common bus edit star main article star network star network topology in local area networks with a star topology each network host is connected to a central hub with a point to point connection in star topology every node computer workstation or any other peripheral is connected to central node called hub or switch the switch is the server and the peripherals are the clients the network does not necessarily have to resemble a star to be classified as a star network but all of the nodes on the network must be connected to one central device all traffic that traverses the network passes through the central hub the hub acts as a signal repeater the star topology is considered the easiest topology to design and implement an advantage of the star topology is the simplicity of adding additional nodes the primary disadvantage of the star topology is that the hub represents a single point of failure notes a point to point link described above is sometimes categorized as a special instance of the physical star topology 160 therefore the simplest type of network that is based upon the physical star topology would consist of one node with a single point to point link to a second node the choice of which node is the hub and which node is the spoke being arbitrary 1 after the special case of the point to point link as in note 1 above the next simplest type of network that is based upon the physical star topology would consist of one central node 160 the hub 160 with two separate point to point links to two peripheral nodes 160 the spokes although most networks that are based upon the physical star topology are commonly implemented using a special device such as a hub or switch as the central node i e the hub of the star it is also possible to implement a network that is based upon the physical star topology using a computer or even a simple common connection point as the hub or central node citation needed star networks may also be described as either broadcast multi access or nonbroadcast multi access nbma depending on whether the technology of the network either automatically propagates a signal at the hub to all spokes or only addresses individual spokes with each communication extended star a type of network topology in which a network that is based upon the physical star topology has one or more repeaters between the central node the hub of the star and the peripheral or spoke nodes the repeaters being used to extend the maximum transmission distance of the point to point links between the central node and the peripheral nodes beyond that which is supported by the transmitter power of the central node or beyond that which is supported by the standard upon which the physical layer of the physical star network is based if the repeaters in a network that is based upon the physical extended star topology are replaced with hubs or switches then a hybrid network topology is created that is referred to as a physical hierarchical star topology although some texts make no distinction between the two topologies distributed star a type of network topology that is composed of individual networks that are based upon the physical star topology connected in a linear fashion 160 i e daisy chained 160 with no central or top level connection point e g two or more stacked hubs along with their associated star connected nodes or spokes edit ring main article ring network ring network topology a network topology that is set up in a circular fashion in which data travels around the ring in one direction and each device on the right acts as a repeater to keep the signal strong as it travels each device incorporates a receiver for the incoming signal and a transmitter to send the data on to the next device in the ring the network is dependent on the ability of the signal to travel around the ring when a device sends data it must travel through each device on the ring until it reaches its destination 5 edit mesh it has been suggested that fully connected network be merged into this article or section discuss proposed since october 2011 main article mesh networking the value of fully meshed networks is proportional to the exponent of the number of subscribers assuming that communicating groups of any two endpoints up to and including all the endpoints is approximated by reed s law fully connected fully connected mesh topology the number of connections in a full mesh n n 1 2 note the physical fully connected mesh topology is generally too costly and complex for practical networks although the topology is used when there are only a small number of nodes to be interconnected see combinatorial explosion partially connected partially connected mesh topology the type of network topology in which some of the nodes of the network are connected to more than one other node in the network with a point to point link 160 this makes it possible to take advantage of some of the redundancy that is provided by a physical fully connected mesh topology without the expense and complexity required for a connection between every node in the network note in networks that are based upon the partially connected mesh topology the data that is transmitted between nodes in the network takes many shortest paths between nodes using a technology like shortest path bridging except in the case of a failure or break in one of the links in which case the network uses the remaining alternative paths to the destination this requires that the nodes of the network possess some type of algorithm to determine the correct path to use at any particular time edit tree tree network topology this section may be confusing or unclear please help us clarify the article suggestions may be on the talk page june 2011 the type of network topology in which a central root node the top level of the hierarchy is connected to one or more other nodes that are one level lower in the hierarchy i e the second level with a point to point link between each of the second level nodes and the top level central root node while each of the second level nodes that are connected to the top level central root node will also have one or more other nodes that are one level lower in the hierarchy i e the third level connected to it also with a point to point link the top level central root node being the only node that has no other node above it in the hierarchy the hierarchy of the tree is symmetrical each node in the network having a specific fixed number of nodes connected to it at the next lower level in the hierarchy the number being referred to as the branching factor of the hierarchical tree this tree has individual peripheral nodes a network that is based upon the physical hierarchical topology must have at least three levels in the hierarchy of the tree since a network with a central root node and only one hierarchical level below it would exhibit the physical topology of a star a network that is based upon the physical hierarchical topology and with a branching factor of 1 would be classified as a physical linear topology the branching factor f is independent of the total number of nodes in the network and therefore if the nodes in the network require ports for connection to other nodes the total number of ports per node may be kept low even though the total number of nodes is large 160 this makes the effect of the cost of adding ports to each node totally dependent upon the branching factor and may therefore be kept as low as required without any effect upon the total number of nodes that are possible the total number of point to point links in a network that is based upon the physical hierarchical topology will be one less than the total number of nodes in the network if the nodes in a network that is based upon the physical hierarchical topology are required to perform any processing upon the data that is transmitted between nodes in the network the nodes that are at higher levels in the hierarchy will be required to perform more processing operations on behalf of other nodes than the nodes that are lower in the hierarchy such a type of network topology is very useful and highly recommended advantages it is scalable secondary nodes allow more devices to be connected to a central node point to point connection of devices having different levels of the network makes it more manageable hence easier fault identification and isolation disadvantages maintenance of the network may be an issue when the network spans a great area since it is a variation of bus topology if the backbone fails the entire network is crippled definition 160 tree topology is a combination of bus and star topology an example of this network could be cable tv technology other examples are in dynamic tree based wireless networks for military mining and otherwise mobile applications 7 the naval postgraduate school monterey ca demonstrated such tree based wireless networks for border security 8 in a pilot system aerial cameras kept aloft by balloons relayed real time high resolution video to ground personnel via a dynamic self healing tree based network edit hybrid hybrid networks use a combination of any two or more topologies in such a way that the resulting network does not exhibit one of the standard topologies e g bus star ring etc for example a tree network connected to a tree network is still a tree network topology a hybrid topology is always produced when two different basic network topologies are connected two common examples for hybrid network are star ring network and star bus network a star ring network consists of two or more star topologies connected using a multistation access unit mau as a centralized hub a star bus network consists of two or more star topologies connected using a bus trunk the bus trunk serves as the network s backbone while grid and torus networks have found popularity in high performance computing applications some systems have used genetic algorithms to design custom networks that have the fewest possible hops in between different nodes some of the resulting layouts are nearly incomprehensible although they function quite well citation needed a snowflake topology is really a star of stars network so it exhibits characteristics of a hybrid network topology but is not composed of two different basic network topologies being connected definition 160 hybrid topology is a combination of bus star and ring topology edit daisy chain except for star based networks the easiest way to add more computers into a network is by daisy chaining or connecting each computer in series to the next if a message is intended for a computer partway down the line each system bounces it along in sequence until it reaches the destination a daisy chained network can take two basic forms linear and ring a linear topology puts a two way link between one computer and the next however this was expensive in the early days of computing since each computer except for the ones at each end required two receivers and two transmitters by connecting the computers at each end a ring topology can be formed an advantage of the ring is that the number of transmitters and receivers can be cut in half since a message will eventually loop all of the way around when a node sends a message the message is processed by each computer in the ring if the ring breaks at a particular link then the transmission can be sent via the reverse path thereby ensuring that all nodes are always connected in the case of a single failure edit centralization the star topology reduces the probability of a network failure by connecting all of the peripheral nodes computers etc to a central node when the physical star topology is applied to a logical bus network such as ethernet this central node traditionally a hub rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network sometimes including the originating node all peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to and receiving from the central node only the failure of a transmission line linking any peripheral node to the central node will result in the isolation of that peripheral node from all others but the remaining peripheral nodes will be unaffected however the disadvantage is that the failure of the central node will cause the failure of all of the peripheral nodes also if the central node is passive the originating node must be able to tolerate the reception of an echo of its own transmission delayed by the two way round trip transmission time i e to and from the central node plus any delay generated in the central node an active star network has an active central node that usually has the means to prevent echo related problems a tree topology a k a hierarchical topology can be viewed as a collection of star networks arranged in a hierarchy this tree has individual peripheral nodes e g leaves which are required to transmit to and receive from one other node only and are not required to act as repeaters or regenerators unlike the star network the functionality of the central node may be distributed as in the conventional star network individual nodes may thus still be isolated from the network by a single point failure of a transmission path to the node if a link connecting a leaf fails that leaf is isolated if a connection to a non leaf node fails an entire section of the network becomes isolated from the rest to alleviate the amount of network traffic that comes from broadcasting all signals to all nodes more advanced central nodes were developed that are able to keep track of the identities of the nodes that are connected to the network these network switches will learn the layout of the network by listening on each port during normal data transmission examining the data packets and recording the address identifier of each connected node and which port it is connected to in a lookup table held in memory this lookup table then allows future transmissions to be forwarded to the intended destination only edit decentralization in a mesh topology i e a partially connected mesh topology there are at least two nodes with two or more paths between them to provide redundant paths to be used in case the link providing one of the paths fails this decentralization is often used to advantage to compensate for the single point failure disadvantage that is present when using a single device as a central node e g in star and tree networks a special kind of mesh limiting the number of hops between two nodes is a hypercube the number of arbitrary forks in mesh networks makes them more difficult to design and implement but their decentralized nature makes them very useful this is similar in some ways to a grid network where a linear or ring topology is used to connect systems in multiple directions a multi dimensional ring has a toroidal topology for instance a fully connected network complete topology or full mesh topology is a network topology in which there is a direct link between all pairs of nodes in a fully connected network with n nodes there are n n 1 2 direct links networks designed with this topology are usually very expensive to set up but provide a high degree of reliability due to the multiple paths for data that are provided by the large number of redundant links between nodes this topology is mostly seen in military applications
