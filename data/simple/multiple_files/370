for the page on metadata about wikipedia see wikipedia metadata the term metadata is ambiguous as it is used for two fundamentally different concepts types although the expression data about data is often used it does not apply to both in the same way structural metadata the design and specification of data structures cannot be about the data because at design time the application contains no data in this case the correct description would be data about the containers of data descriptive metadata on the other hand is about individual instances of application data the data content in this case a useful description resulting in a disambiguating neologism would be data about data content or content about content thus metacontent descriptive guide and the national information standards organization concept of administrative metadata are all subtypes of metacontent citation needed metadata metacontent are traditionally found in the card catalogs of libraries as information has become increasingly digital metadata are also used to describe digital data using metadata standards specific to a particular discipline by describing the contents and context of data files the quality of the original data files is greatly increased for example a webpage may include metadata specifying what language it is written in what tools were used to create it and where to go for more on the subject allowing browsers to automatically improve the experience of users contents 1 definition 1 1 libraries 1 2 photographs 1 3 video 1 4 web pages 1 5 creation of metadata 2 metadata types 3

and management 6 1 metadata storage 6 2 metadata management 6 3 database management 7 references 8 external links edit definition metadata metacontent are defined as the data providing information about one or more aspects of the data such as means of creation of the data purpose of the data time and date of creation creator or author of the data location on a computer network where the data were created standards used for example a digital image may include metadata that describe how large the picture is the color depth the image resolution when the image was created and other data a text document s metadata may contain information about how long the document is who the author is when the document was written and a short summary of the document metadata are data as such metadata can be stored and managed in a database often called a metadata registry or metadata repository 1 however without context and a point of reference it might be impossible to identify metadata just by looking at them 2 for example by itself a database containing several numbers all 13 digits long could be the results of calculations or a list of numbers to plug into an equation without any other context the numbers themselves can be perceived as the data but if given the context that this database is a log of a book collection those 13 digit numbers may now be identified as isbns information that refers to the book but is not itself the information within the book the term metadata was coined in 1968 by philip bagley in his book extension of programming language concepts 3 where it is clear that he uses the term in the iso 11179 traditional sense which is structural metadata i e data about the containers of data rather than the alternate sense content about individual instances of data content or metacontent the type of data usually found in library catalogues 4 5 since then the fields of information management information science information technology librarianship and gis have widely adopted the term in these fields the word metadata is defined as data about data 6 while this is the generally accepted definition various disciplines have adopted their own more specific explanation and uses of the term edit libraries metadata have been used in various forms as a means of cataloging archived information the dewey decimal system employed by libraries for the classification of library materials is an early example of metadata usage library catalogues used 3x5 inch cards to display a book s title author subject matter and a brief plot synopsis along with an abbreviated alpha numeric identification system which indicated the physical location of the book within the library s shelves such data help classify aggregate identify and locate a particular book another form of older metadata collection is the use by us census bureau of what is known as the long form the long form asks questions that are used to create demographic data to find patterns of distribution 7 for the purposes of this article an object refers to any of the following a physical item such as a book cd dvd map chair table flower pot etc an electronic file such as a digital image digital photo document program file database table etc edit photographs metadata may be written into a digital photo file that will identify who owns it copyright amp contact information what camera created the file along with exposure information and descriptive information such as keywords about the photo making the file searchable on the computer and or the internet some metadata are written by the camera and some is input by the photographer and or software after downloading to a computer however not all digital cameras enable you to edit metadata 8 this functionality has been available on most nikon dslrs since the nikon d3 and on most new canon cameras since the canon eos 7d photographic metadata standards are governed by organizations that develop the following standards they include but are not limited to iptc information interchange model iim international press telecommunications council iptc core schema for xmp xmp extensible metadata platform an iso standard exif exchangeable image file format maintained by cipa camera amp imaging products association and published by jeita japan electronics and information technology industries association dublin core dublin core metadata initiative dcmi plus picture licensing universal system edit video metadata are particularly useful in video where information about its contents such as transcripts of conversations and text descriptions of its scenes are not directly understandable by a computer but where efficient search is desirable edit web pages web pages often include metadata in the form of meta tags description and keywords meta tags are commonly used to describe the web page s content most search engines use these data when adding pages to their search index edit creation of metadata metadata can be created either by automated information processing or by manual work elementary metadata captured by computers can include information about when a file was created who created it when it was last updated file size and file extension edit metadata types the metadata application is manyfold covering a large variety of fields of application there are nothing but specialised and well accepted models to specify types of metadata bretheron amp singley 1994 distinguish between two distinct classes structural control metadata and guide metadata 9 structural metadata are used to describe the structure of computer systems such as tables columns and indexes guide metadata are used to help humans find specific items and are usually expressed as a set of keywords in a natural language according to ralph kimball metadata can be divided into 2 similar categories technical metadata and business metadata technical metadata correspond to internal metadata business metadata to external metadata kimball adds a third category named process metadata on the other hand niso distinguishes between three types of metadata descriptive structural and administrative 6 descriptive metadata are the information used to search and locate an object such as title author subjects keywords publisher structural metadata give a description of how the components of the object are organised and administrative metadata refer to the technical information including file type two sub types of administrative metadata are rights management metadata and preservation metadata edit metadata structures metadata metacontent or more correctly the vocabularies used to assemble metadata metacontent statements are typically structured according to a standardized concept using a well defined metadata scheme including metadata standards and metadata models tools such as controlled vocabularies taxonomies thesauri data dictionaries and metadata registries can be used to apply further standardization to the metadata structural metadata commonality is also of paramount importance in data model development and in database design edit metadata syntax metadata metacontent syntax refers to the rules created to structure the fields or elements of metadata metacontent 10 a single metadata scheme may be expressed in a number of different markup or programming languages each of which requires a different syntax for example dublin core may be expressed in plain text html xml and rdf 11 a common example of guide metacontent is the bibliographic classification the subject the dewey decimal class number there is always an implied statement in any classification of some object to classify an object as for example dewey class number 514 topology i e books having the number 514 on their spine the implied statement is lt book gt lt subject heading gt lt 514 gt this is a subject predicate object triple or more importantly a class attribute value triple the first two elements of the triple class attribute are pieces of some structural metadata having a defined semantic the third element is a value preferably from some controlled vocabulary some reference master data the combination of the metadata and master data elements results in a statement which is a metacontent statement i e metacontent metadata master data all these elements can be thought of as vocabulary both metadata and master data are vocabularies which can be assembled into metacontent statements there are many sources of these vocabularies both meta and master data uml edifact xsd dewey udc loc skos iso 25964 pantone linnaean binomial nomenclature etc using controlled vocabularies for the components of metacontent statements whether for indexing or finding is endorsed by iso 25964 if both the indexer and the searcher are guided to choose the same term for the same concept then relevant documents will be retrieved this is particularly relevant when considering that the behemoth of the internet google is simply indexing then matching text strings there is no intelligence or inferencing occurring edit hierarchical linear and planar schemata metadata schema can be hierarchical in nature where relationships exist between metadata elements and elements are nested so that parent child relationships exist between the elements an example of a hierarchical metadata schema is the ieee lom schema where metadata elements may belong to a parent metadata element metadata schema can also be one dimensional or linear where each element is completely discrete from other elements and classified according to one dimension only an example of a linear metadata schema is dublin core schema which is one dimensional metadata schema are often two dimensional or planar where each element is completely discrete from other elements but classified according to two orthogonal dimensions 12 edit metadata hypermapping in all cases where the metadata schemata exceed the planar depiction some type of hypermapping is required to enable display and view of metadata according to chosen aspect and to serve special views hypermapping frequently applies to layering of geographical and geological information overlays 13 edit granularity the degree to which the data or metadata are structured is referred to as their granularity metadata with a high granularity allow for deeper structured information and enable greater levels of technical manipulation however a lower level of granularity means that metadata can be created for considerably lower costs but will not provide as detailed information the major impact of granularity is not only on creation and capture but moreover on maintenance as soon as the metadata structures get outdated the access to the referred data will get outdated hence granularity shall take into account the effort to create as well as the effort to maintain edit metadata standards international standards apply to metadata much work is being accomplished in the national and international standards communities especially ansi american national standards institute and iso international organization for standardization to reach consensus on standardizing metadata and registries the core standard is iso iec 11179 1 2004 14 and subsequent standards see iso iec 11179 all yet published registrations according to this standard cover just the definition of metadata and do not serve the structuring of metadata storage or retrieval neither any administrative standardisation it is important to note that this standard refers to metadata as the data about containers of the data and not to metadata metacontent as the data about the data contents it should also be noted that this standard describes itself originally as a data element registry describing disembodied data elements and explicitly disavows the capability of containing complex structures thus the original term data element is more applicable than the later applied buzzword metadata the dublin core metadata terms are a set of vocabulary terms which can be used to describe resources for the purposes of discovery the original set of 15 classic 2 metadata terms known as the dublin core metadata element set 3 are endorsed in the following standards documents ietf rfc 5013 4 iso standard 15836 2009 5 niso standard z39 85 6 although not a standard microformat also mentionned in the section metadata on the internet below is a web based approach to semantic markup which seeks to re use existing html xhtml tags to convey metadata microformat follows xhtml and html standards but is not a standard in itself one advocate of microformats tantek elik characterized a problem with alternative approaches here s a new language we want you to learn and now you need to output these additional files on your server it s a hassle microformats lower the barrier to entry 15 edit metadata usage edit data virtualization main article data virtualization data virtualization has emerged as the new software technology to complete the virtualization stack in the enterprise metadata are used in data virtualization servers which are enterprise infrastructure components alongside database and application servers metadata in these servers are saved as persistent repository and describe business objects in various enterprise systems and applications structural metadata commonality is also important to support data virtualization edit svn checkout metadata svn maintains svn hidden files created in the web root folder which can reveal crucial information of the code repositories edit statistics and census services standardization work has had a large impact on efforts to build metadata systems in the statistical community several metadata standards are described and their importance to statistical agencies is discussed applications of the standards at the census bureau environmental protection agency bureau of labor statistics statistics canada and many others are described emphasis is on the impact a metadata registry can have in a statistical agency edit library and information science libraries employ metadata in library catalogues most commonly as part of an integrated library management system metadata are obtained by cataloguing resources such as books periodicals dvds web pages or digital images these data are stored in the integrated library management system ilms using the marc metadata standard the purpose is to direct patrons to the physical or electronic location of items or areas they seek as well as to provide a description of the item s in question more recent and specialized instances of library metadata include the establishment of digital libraries including e print repositories and digital image libraries while often based on library principles the focus on non librarian use especially in providing metadata means they do not follow traditional or common cataloging approaches given the custom nature of included materials metadata fields are often specially created e g taxonomic classification fields location fields keywords or copyright statement standard file information such as file size and format are usually automatically included 16 standardization for library operation has been a key topic in international standardization iso for decades standards for metadata in digital libraries include dublin core mets mods ddi iso standard digital object identifier doi iso standard uniform resource name urn premis schema ecological metadata language and oai pmh leading libraries in the world give hints on their metadata standards strategies 17 18 edit metadata and the law edit united states problems involving metadata in litigation in the united states are becoming widespread when courts have looked at various questions involving metadata including the discoverability of metadata by parties although the federal rules of civil procedure have only specified rules about electronic documents subsequent case law has elaborated on the requirement of parties to reveal metadata 19 in october 2009 the arizona supreme court has ruled that metadata records are public record 20 document metadata have proven particularly important in legal environments in which litigation has requested metadata which can include sensitive information detrimental to a party in court using metadata removal tools to clean documents can mitigate the risks of unwittingly sending sensitive data this process partially see data remanence protects law firms from potentially damaging leaking of sensitive data through electronic discovery edit metadata in healthcare australian researches in medicine started a lot of metadata definition for applications in health care that approach offers the first recognized attempt to adhere to international standards in medical sciences instead of defining a proprietary standard under the who umbrella first the medical community yet did not approve the need to follow metadata standards despite respective research 21 edit metadata and data warehousing data warehouse dw is a repository of an organization s electronically stored data data warehouses are designed to manage and store the data whereas the business intelligence bi focuses on the usage of the data to facilitate reporting and analysis 22 the purpose of a data warehouse is to house standardized structured consistent integrated correct cleansed and timely data extracted from various operational systems in an organization the extracted data are integrated in the data warehouse environment in order to provide an enterprise wide perspective one version of the truth data are structured in a way to specifically address the reporting and analytic requirements the design of structural metadata commonality using a data modeling method such as entity relationship model diagramming is very important in any data warehouse development effort an essential component of a data warehouse business intelligence system is the metadata and tools to manage and retrieve the metadata ralph kimball 23 describes metadata as the dna of the data warehouse as metadata defines the elements of the data warehouse and how they work together kimball et al 24 refers to three main categories of metadata technical metadata business metadata and process metadata technical metadata are primarily definitional while business metadata and process metadata are primarily descriptive keep in mind that the categories sometimes overlap technical metadata define the objects and processes in a dw bi system as seen from a technical point of view the technical metadata include the system metadata which define the data structures such as tables fields data types indexes and partitions in the relational engine and databases dimensions measures and data mining models technical metadata define the data model and the way it is displayed for the users with the reports schedules distribution lists and user security rights business metadata are a content from the data warehouse described in more user friendly terms the business metadata tell you what data you have where they come from what they mean and what is their relationship is to other data in the data warehouse business metadata may also serve as a documentation for the dw bi system users who browse the data warehouse are primarily viewing the business metadata process metadata are used to describe the results of various operations in the data warehouse within the etl process all key data from tasks are logged on execution this includes start time end time cpu seconds used disk reads disk writes and rows processed when troubleshooting the etl or query process this sort of data becomes valuable process metadata are the fact measurement when building and using a dw bi system some organizations make a living out of collecting and selling this sort of data to companies in that case the process metadata become the business metadata for the fact and dimension tables collecting process metadata is in the interest of business people who can use the data to identify the users of their products which products they are using and what level of service they are receiving edit metadata on the internet the html format used to define web pages allows for the inclusion of a variety of types of metadata from basic descriptive text dates and keywords to further advanced metadata schemes such as the dublin core e gms and agls 25 standards pages can also be geotagged with coordinates metadata may be included in the page s header or in a separate file microformats allow metadata to be added to on page data in a way that users do not see but computers can readily access interestingly many search engines are cautious about using metadata in their ranking algorithms due to exploitation of metadata and the practice of search engine optimization seo to improve rankings see meta element article for further discussion studies show that search engines respond to web pages with metadata implementations 26 edit metadata in the broadcast industry in broadcast industry metadata are linked to audio and video broadcast media to identify the media clip or playlist names duration timecode etc describe the content notes regarding the quality of video content rating description for example during a sport event keywords like goal red card will be associated to some clips classify media metadata allow to sort the media or to easily and quickly find a video content a tv news could urgently need some archive content for a subject for example the bbc have a large subject classification system lonclass a customized version of the more general purpose universal decimal classification these metadata can be linked to the video media thanks to the video servers all latest broadcasted sport events like fifa world cup or olympic games use these metadata to distribute their video content to tv stations through keywords it s often the host broadcaster 27 who is in charge of organizing metadata through its international broadcast centre and its video servers those metadata are recorded with the images and are entered by metadata operators loggers who associate in live metadata available in metadata grids through software such as multicam lsm or ipdirector used during fifa world cup or olympic games 28 29 edit geospatial metadata metadata that describe geographic objects such as datasets maps features or simply documents with a geospatial component have a history dating back to at least 1994 refer mit library page on fgdc metadata this class of metadata is described more fully on the geospatial metadata page edit ecological amp environmental metadata ecological and environmental metadata are intended to document the who what when where why and how of data collection for a particular study metadata should be generated in a format commonly used by the most relevant science community such as darwin core ecological metadata language 30 or dublin core metadata editing tools exist to facilitate metadata generation e g metavist 31 mercury metadata search system morpho 32 metadata should describe provenance of the data where they originated as well as any transformations the data underwent and how to give credit for cite the data products edit digital music cds such as recordings of music will carry a layer of metadata about the recordings such as dates artist genre copyright owner etc the metadata not normally displayed by cd players can be accessed and displayed by specialized music playback and or editing applications the metadata for compressed and uncompressed digital music is often encoded in the id3 tag common editors such as taglib support mp3 ogg vorbis flac mpc speex wavpack trueaudio wav aiff mp4 and asf file formats edit cloud applications with the availability of cloud applications which include those to add metadata to content metadata is increasingly available over the internet edit metadata administration and management edit metadata storage this section does not cite any references or sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june 2010 metadata can be stored either internally 33 in the same file as the data or externally in a separate file metadata that are embedded with content is called embedded metadata a data repository typically stores the metadata detached from the data both ways have advantages and disadvantages internal storage allows transferring metadata together with the data they describe thus metadata are always at hand and can be manipulated easily this method creates high redundancy and does not allow holding metadata together external storage allows bundling metadata for example in a database for more efficient searching there is no redundancy and metadata can be transferred simultaneously when using streaming however as most formats use uris for that purpose the method of how the metadata are linked to their data should be treated with care what if a resource does not have a uri resources on a local hard disk or web pages that are created on the fly using a content management system what if the metadata can only be evaluated if there is a connection to the web especially when using rdf how to realize that a resource is replaced by another with the same name but different content moreover there is the question of data format storing metadata in a human readable format such as xml can be useful because users can understand and edit it without specialized tools on the other hand these formats are not optimized for storage capacity it may be useful to store metadata in a binary non human readable format instead to speed up transfer and save memory edit metadata management metadata management is the end to end process and governance framework for creating controlling enhancing attributing defining and managing a metadata schema model or other structured aggregation either independently or within a repository and the associated supporting processes often to enable the management of content the world wide web consortium w3c has identified governance as a key challenge in the advancement of third generation web technologies web 3 0 semantic web and a number of research prototypes such as s3db explore the use of semantic modeling to identify practical solutions edit database management each relational database system has its own mechanisms for storing metadata examples of relational database metadata include tables of all tables in a database their names sizes and number of rows in each table tables of columns in each database what tables they are used in and the type of data stored in each column in database terminology this set of metadata is referred to as the catalog the sql standard specifies a uniform means to access the catalog called the information schema but not all databases implement it even if they implement other aspects of the sql standard for an example of database specific metadata access methods see oracle metadata
