2012 society for industrial and applied mathematics siam logo formation 1951 headquarters philadelphia pennsylvania united states membership gt 12 000 president lloyd nicholas trefethen website www siam org the society for industrial and applied mathematics siam was founded by a small group of mathematicians from academia and industry who met in philadelphia in 1951 to start an organization whose members would meet periodically to exchange ideas about the uses of mathematics in industry this meeting led to the organization of the society for industrial and applied mathematics the membership of siam has grown from a few hundred in the early 1950s to more than 12 000 as of 2009 update siam retains its north american influence but it also has east asian argentinian bulgarian and uk amp ireland sections siam is one of the four parts of the joint policy board for mathematics contents 1 members 2 focus 3 activity groups siags 4 journals 5 books 6 conferences 7 siam news 8 prizes

focus the focus for the society is applied computational and industrial mathematics and the society often promotes its acronym as science and industry advance with mathematics it is composed of a combination of people from a wide variety of vocations members include engineers scientists industrial mathematicians and academic mathematicians the society is active in promoting the use of analysis and modeling in all settings the society also strives to support and provide guidance to educational institutions wishing to promote applied mathematics edit activity groups siags the society includes a number of activity groups to allow for more focused group discussions and collaborations algebraic geometry analysis of partial differential equations computational science and engineering control and systems theory data mining and analytics discrete mathematics dynamical systems financial mathematics and engineering geometric design geosciences imaging science life sciences linear algebra mathematical aspects of materials science nonlinear waves and coherent structures optimization orthogonal polynomials and special functions supercomputing uncertainty quantification edit journals as

recognition siam recognizes applied mathematician and computational scientists for their contributions to the fields prizes include 2 germund dahlquist prize awarded to a young scientist normally under 45 for original contributions to fields associated with germund dahlquist numerical solution of differential equations and numerical methods for scientific computing 3 ralph e kleinman prize awarded for outstanding research or other contributions that bridge the gap between mathematics and applications each prize may be given either for a single notable achievement or for a collection of such achievements 4 j d crawford prize awarded to one individual for recent outstanding work on a topic in nonlinear science as evidenced by a publication in english in a peer reviewed journal within the four calendar years preceding the meeting at which the prize is awarded 5 richard c diprima prize awarded to a young scientist who has done outstanding research in applied mathematics defined as those topics covered by siam journals and who has completed his her doctoral dissertation and completed all other requirements for his her doctorate during the period running from three years prior to the award date to one year prior to the award date 6 george p lya prize is given every two years alternately in two categories 1 for a notable application of combinatorial theory 2 for a notable contribution in another area of interest to george p lya such as approximation theory complex analysis number theory orthogonal polynomials probability theory or mathematical discovery and learning 7 w t and idalia reid prize awarded for research in and contributions to areas of differential equations and control theory 8 theodore von k rm n prize awarded for notable application of mathematics to mechanics and or the engineering sciences made during the five to ten years preceding the award 9 james h wilkinson prize awarded for research in or other contributions to numerical analysis and scientific computing during the six years preceding the award 10 edit siam fellows in 2009 siam instituted a fellows program to recognize certain members who have made outstanding contributions to the fields siam serves 11 edit moody s mega math m 3 challenge funded by the moody s foundation and organized by siam the moody s mega math challenge is an applied mathematics modeling competition for high school students along the entire east coast from maine through florida scholarship prizes total 100 000 edit students siam undergraduate research online publishes outstanding undergraduate research in applied and computational mathematics student memberships are generally discounted or free siam has career and job resources for students and other applied mathematicians and computational
