computer accessibility also known as accessible computing refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people regardless of disability or severity of impairment it is largely a software concern when software hardware or a combination of hardware and software is used to enable use of a computer by a person with a disability or impairment this is known as assistive technology there are numerous types of impairment that affect computer use these include cognitive impairments and learning disabilities such as dyslexia adhd or autism visual impairment such as low vision complete or partial blindness and color blindness hearing impairment including deafness or hard of hearing motor or dexterity impairment such as paralysis cerebral palsy or carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive strain injury these impairments can present themselves with variable severity they may be acquired from disease trauma or may be congenital or degeneration in nature accessibility is often abbreviated a11y where the number 11 refers to the number of letters omitted this parallels the abbreviations of internationalization and localization as i18n and l10n respectively contents 1 special needs

links edit special needs assessment people wishing to overcome an impairment in order to use a computer comfortably and productively may require a special needs assessment by an assistive technology consultant such as an occupational therapist or clinical scientist to help them identify and configure appropriate assertive hardware and software when a disabled person is unable to leave their own home it may be possible to assess them remotely using remote desktop software and a web cam the assessor logs on to the client s computer via a broadband internet connection and then remotely makes accessibility adjustments to the client s computer where necessary additionally the assessor is able to observe their computer usage edit considerations for specific impairments bbc news shown in desktop mode with accessibility links at the top the screenshot is from a mobile device a single switch assistive device that enables the user to access an on screen computer keyboard dr hessa al jaber is the secretary general of the supreme council of information and communication technology ictqatar she has been instrumental in the creation of mada an assistive technology center that serves persons with disabilities in qatar edit cognitive impairments and illiteracy the biggest challenge in computer accessibility is to make resources accessible to people with cognitive disabilities particularly those with poor communication skills and those without reading skills their further development relies on public domain icons being available many people with a learning disability learn and rely on proprietary symbols they thus become tied to particular products the copyright owners are generally unwilling to release them on the web other examples include web accessibility a set of guidelines 1 and two accessible 2 web portals designed for people developing reading skills are peepo com 1 amp m dash try typing a letter with your keyboard for more amp m dash and peepo co uk 2 with enhanced graphics unique style controls and improved interactivity requires an svg supported browser an alternative approach where users want to access public computer based terminals in libraries atm information kiosks etc is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal such as a smart card that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed text size etc to their particular needs the concept is encompassed by the cen en 1332 4 identification card systems man machine interface 3 this development of this standard has been supported in europe by snapi and has been successfully incorporated into the lasseo specifications edit visual impairment since computer interfaces often solicit visual input and provide visual feedback another significant challenge in computer accessibility involves making software usable by people with visual impairment for individuals with mild to medium vision impairment it is helpful to use large fonts high dpi displays high contrast themes and icons supplemented with auditory feedback and screen magnifying software in the case of severe vision impairment such as blindness screen reader software that provides feedback via text to speech or a refreshable braille display is a necessary accommodation for interaction with a computer about 8 of people mostly males suffer from some form of colour blindness the main colour combinations that might be confused by people with visual deficiency include red green and blue green however in a well designed user interface color should not be the only way of distinguishing between different pieces of information edit motor and dexterity impairments some people may not be able to use a conventional input device such as the mouse or the keyboard therefore it is important for software functions to be accessible using both devices ideally software uses a generic input api that permits the use even of highly specialized devices unheard of at the time of software development keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures are ways to achieve this more specialized solutions like on screen software keyboards and alternate input devices like switches joysticks and trackballs are also available speech recognition technology is also a compelling and suitable alternative to conventional keyboard and mouse input as it simply requires a commonly available audio headset the astrophysicist stephen hawking is a famous example of a person suffering from motor disability he uses a switch combined with special software that allows him to control his wheelchair mounted computer using his remaining small movement ability this performs as a normal computer allowing him to research and produce his written work and as an augmentative and alternative communication and environmental control device edit hearing impairment while sound user interfaces have a secondary role in common desktop computing usually limited to system sounds as feedback software producers take into account people who can t hear either for personal disability noisy environments silence requirements or lack of sound hardware such system sounds like beeps can be substituted or supplemented with visual notifications and captioned text akin to closed captions edit software accessibility edit accessibility apis software api exist to allow assistive technology products like screen readers text to speech etc to work with software the current or past apis are microsoft active accessibility msaa on microsoft windows microsoft ui automation on microsoft windows replacing msaa iaccessible2 on microsoft windows a competitor of microsoft ui automation also replacing msaa at spi on unix and linux mac os x accessibility java accessibility and the java access bridge for java software 4 edit accessibility features in mainstream software accessibility software can also make input devices easier to use at the user level keyboard shortcuts and mousekeys allow the user to substitute keyboarding for mouse actions macro recorders can greatly extend the range and sophistication of keyboard shortcuts sticky keys allows characters or commands to be typed without having to hold down a modifier key shift ctrl alt while pressing a second key similarly clicklock is a microsoft windows feature that remembers a mouse button is down so that items can be highlighted or dragged without holding the mouse button down throughout customization of mouse or mouse alternatives responsiveness to movement double clicking and so forth togglekeys 5 is a feature of microsoft windows 95 onwards a high sound is heard when the caps lock scroll lock or num lock key is switched on and a low sound is heard when any of those keys are switched off customization of pointer appearance such as size color and shape predictive text spell checkers and grammar checkers edit support for learning disabilities other approaches that may be particularly relevant to users with a learning disability include cause and effect software 6 switch accessible software hand eye co ordination skills software diagnostic assessment software mind mapping software study skills software symbol based software 7 text to speech touch typing software edit web accessibility main article web accessibility enabling access to web content for all users is the concern of the web accessibility movement websites can be designed to be more accessible by their conformance to certain design principles screen readers are of limited use when reading text from websites designed without consideration to accessibility this can be due to the differences between spoken and written language and the complexity of text but it is mainly due to poor page design practices the tendency to indicate semantic meaning using methods that are purely presentational e g larger or smaller font sizes using different font colors or images or multimedia to provide information restricts meaningful access to some users therefore designing sites in accordance with web accessibility principles helps enable meaningful access for all users for example web designers can ensure that navigation and content is as plain and simple as appropriate and long texts should provide summaries see also alt attribute edit open accessibility framework the open accessibility framework oaf 8 provides a high level outline of the steps that must be in place for any computing platform to be considered accessible these steps are analogous to those necessary to make the physical built environment accessible the oaf divides the required steps into two categories creation and use the creation steps describe the necessary precursors and building blocks to enable developers to create accessible applications and products they are define what accessible means for the platform it must be clear what is meant by accessible because this will differ according to the modality and capabilities of each platform the definition may include accessibility features such as tabbing navigation theming and an accessibility api provide accessible stock user interface elements pre built stock user interface elements used by application developers and authoring tools must be implemented to make use of the accessibility features of the platform provide authoring tools that support accessibility the tools used by application developers and content authors must be implemented to encourage use of the accessibility features of the platform this may include features such as encouraging the use of accessible stock user interface elements prompting for information required to properly implement an accessibility api and accessibility evaluation and repair tools the use steps describe what is necessary in the computing environment in which these accessible applications will run they are provide platform support computing platforms must properly implement the accessibility features that are specified in their accessibility definition for example the accessibility api definitions must in fact be implemented correctly in the program code provide accessible application software accessible applications must actually be available for the platform these applications must support the accessibility features of the platform this may have been achieved using the accessible stock elements and authoring tools that support accessibility provide assistive technologies assistive technologies e g screen readers screen magnifiers voice input adapted keyboards must actually be available for the platform the following examples show that the oaf can be applied to different types of platforms desktop operating systems web applications 9 and the mobile platform a fuller list can be found in the open source accessibility repository by the open accessibility everywhere group oaeg 10 accessibility apis like the assistive technology service provider interface and ui automation on the desktop wai aria in web applications and the blackberry accessibility api 11 on the blackberry operating system the implementation of accessibility apis keyboard access and theming in widget libraries like java swing for desktop applications the jquery ui and fluid infusion 12 for web applications and the lightweight user interface toolkit lwuit for mobile applications support for accessible development using glade for the gtk toolkit 13 the dias plugin for netbeans ide 14 xcode ide for ios applications 15 accessibility inspection tools like accerciser for at spi 16 and support for accessible authoring with the accessodf plugin for libreoffice and openoffice 17 also fit into this step support for ui automation on microsoft windows 18 19 support for atk and at spi in linux gnome 20 wai aria support in firefox 21 22 the midp lwuit mobile runtime 23 or the midp lcdui mobile runtime that is available on mobile phones with java the daisy player amis on the microsoft windows desktop 24 and the aegis contact manager for phones with java me 25 the gnome shell magnifier and orca on the gnome desktop the web based screen reader webanywhere 26 and the alternative text entry system dasher for ios and android 27 28 are examples of assistive technologies the goal of the six steps and the corresponding tools is to embed accessibility into mainstream software 29 edit see also modding assistive
