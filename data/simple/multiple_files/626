for the search engine of the same name see webcrawler not to be confused with offline reader a web crawler is a computer program that browses the world wide web in a methodical automated manner or in an orderly fashion other terms for web crawlers are ants automatic indexers bots 1 web spiders 2 web robots 2 or especially in the foaf community web scutters 3 this process is called web crawling or spidering many sites in particular search engines use spidering as a means of providing up to date data web crawlers are mainly used to create a copy of all the visited pages for later processing by a search engine that will index the downloaded pages to provide fast searches crawlers can also be used for automating maintenance tasks on a web site such as checking links or validating html code also crawlers can be used to gather specific types of information from web pages such as harvesting e mail addresses usually for sending spam a web crawler is one type of bot or software agent in general it starts with a list of urls to visit called the seeds as the crawler visits these urls it identifies all the hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of urls to visit called the crawl frontier urls from the frontier are recursively visited according to a set of policies the large volume implies that the crawler can only download a limited number of the web pages within a given time so it needs to prioritize its downloads the high rate of change implies that the pages might have already been updated or even deleted the number of possible crawlable urls being generated by server side software has also made it difficult for web crawlers to avoid retrieving duplicate content endless combinations of http get url based parameters exist of which only a small selection will actually return unique content for example a simple online photo gallery may offer three options to users as specified through http get parameters in the url if there exist four ways to sort images three choices of thumbnail size two file formats and an option to disable user provided content then the same set of content can be accessed with 48 different urls all of which may be linked on the site this mathematical combination creates a problem for crawlers as they must sort through endless combinations of relatively minor scripted changes in order to retrieve unique content as edwards et al noted given that the bandwidth for conducting crawls is neither infinite nor free it is becoming essential to crawl the web in not only a scalable but efficient way if some reasonable measure of quality or freshness is to be maintained 4 a crawler must carefully choose at each step which pages to visit next the behavior of a web crawler is the outcome of a combination of policies 5 a selection policy that states which pages to download a re visit policy that states when to check for changes to the pages a politeness policy that states how to avoid overloading web sites and a parallelization policy that states how to coordinate distributed web crawlers contents 1 selection policy 1 1 focused crawling 1 1 1 restricting followed links 1 1 2 url normalization 1 1 3 path

crawling the deep web 5 1 web crawler bias 6 crawling web 2 0 applications 7 see also 8 references 9 further reading edit selection policy given the current size of the web even large search engines cover only a portion of the publicly available part a 2005 study showed that large scale search engines index no more than 40 70 of the indexable web 6 a previous study by dr steve lawrence and lee giles showed that no search engine indexed more than 16 of the web in 1999 7 as a crawler always downloads just a fraction of the web pages it is highly desirable that the downloaded fraction contains the most relevant pages and not just a random sample of the web this requires a metric of importance for prioritizing web pages the importance of a page is a function of its intrinsic quality its popularity in terms of links or visits and even of its url the latter is the case of vertical search engines restricted to a single top level domain or search engines restricted to a fixed web site designing a good selection policy has an added difficulty it must work with partial information as the complete set of web pages is not known during crawling cho et al made the first study on policies for crawling scheduling their data set was a 180 000 pages crawl from the stanford edu domain in which a crawling simulation was done with different strategies 8 the ordering metrics tested were breadth first backlink count and partial pagerank calculations one of the conclusions was that if the crawler wants to download pages with high pagerank early during the crawling process then the partial pagerank strategy is the better followed by breadth first and backlink count however these results are for just a single domain cho also wrote his ph d dissertation at stanford on web crawling 9 najork and wiener performed an actual crawl on 328 million pages using breadth first ordering 10 they found that a breadth first crawl captures pages with high pagerank early in the crawl but they did not compare this strategy against other strategies the explanation given by the authors for this result is that the most important pages have many links to them from numerous hosts and those links will be found early regardless of on which host or page the crawl originates abiteboul designed a crawling strategy based on an algorithm called opic on line page importance computation 11 in opic each page is given an initial sum of cash that is distributed equally among the pages it points to it is similar to a pagerank computation but it is faster and is only done in one step an opic driven crawler downloads first the pages in the crawling frontier with higher amounts of cash experiments were carried in a 100 000 pages synthetic graph with a power law distribution of in links however there was no comparison with other strategies nor experiments in the real web boldi et al used simulation on subsets of the web of 40 million pages from the it domain and 100 million pages from the webbase crawl testing breadth first against depth first random ordering and an omniscient strategy the comparison was based on how well pagerank computed on a partial crawl approximates the true pagerank value surprisingly some visits that accumulate pagerank very quickly most notably breadth first and the omniscent visit provide very poor progressive approximations 12 13 baeza yates et al used simulation on two subsets of the web of 3 million pages from the gr and cl domain testing several crawling strategies 14 they showed that both the opic strategy and a strategy that uses the length of the per site queues are better than breadth first crawling and that it is also very effective to use a previous crawl when it is available to guide the current one daneshpajouh et al designed a community based algorithm for discovering good seeds 15 their method crawls web pages with high pagerank from different communities in less iteration in comparison with crawl starting from random seeds one can extract good seed from a previously crawled web graph using this new method using these seeds a new crawl can be very effective edit focused crawling main article focused crawler the importance of a page for a crawler can also be expressed as a function of the similarity of a page to a given query web crawlers that attempt to download pages that are similar to each other are called focused crawler or topical crawlers the concepts of topical and focused crawling were first introduced by menczer 16 17 and by chakrabarti et al 18 the main problem in focused crawling is that in the context of a web crawler we would like to be able to predict the similarity of the text of a given page to the query before actually downloading the page a possible predictor is the anchor text of links this was the approach taken by pinkerton 19 in the first web crawler of the early days of the web diligenti et al 20 propose using the complete content of the pages already visited to infer the similarity between the driving query and the pages that have not been visited yet the performance of a focused crawling depends mostly on the richness of links in the specific topic being searched and a focused crawling usually relies on a general web search engine for providing starting points edit restricting followed links a crawler may only want to seek out html pages and avoid all other mime types in order to request only html resources a crawler may make an http head request to determine a web resource s mime type before requesting the entire resource with a get request to avoid making numerous head requests a crawler may examine the url and only request a resource if the url ends with certain characters such as html htm asp aspx php jsp jspx or a slash this strategy may cause numerous html web resources to be unintentionally skipped some crawlers may also avoid requesting any resources that have a in them are dynamically produced in order to avoid spider traps that may cause the crawler to download an infinite number of urls from a web site this strategy is unreliable if the site uses a rewrite engine to simplify its urls edit url normalization main article url normalization crawlers usually perform some type of url normalization in order to avoid crawling the same resource more than once the term url normalization also called url canonicalization refers to the process of modifying and standardizing a url in a consistent manner there are several types of normalization that may be performed including conversion of urls to lowercase removal of and segments and adding trailing slashes to the non empty path component 21 edit path ascending crawling some crawlers intend to download as many resources as possible from a particular web site so path ascending crawler was introduced that would ascend to every path in each url that it intends to crawl 22 for example when given a seed url of http llama org hamster monkey page html it will attempt to crawl hamster monkey hamster and cothey found that a path ascending crawler was very effective in finding isolated resources or resources for which no inbound link would have been found in regular crawling many path ascending crawlers are also known as web harvesting software because they re used to harvest or collect all the content 160 perhaps the collection of photos in a gallery 160 from a specific page or host edit academic focused crawler an example of the focused crawlers are academic crawlers which crawls free access academic related documents such as the citeseerxbot which is the crawler of citeseer x search engine other academic search engines are google scholar and microsoft academic search etc because most academic papers are published in pdf formats such kind of crawler is particularly interested in crawling pdf postscript files microsoft word including their zipped formats because of this general open source crawlers such as heritrix must be customized to filter out other mime types or a middleware is used to extract these documents out and import them to the focused crawl database and repository 23 identifying whether these documents are academic or not is challenging can add a significant overhead to the crawling process so this is performed as a post crawling process using machine learning or regular expression algorithms these academic documents are usually obtained from home pages of faculties and students or from publication page of research institutes because academic documents takes only a small faction in the entire web pages a good seed selection are important in boosting the efficiencies of these web crawlers 24 other academic crawlers may download plain text and html files that contains metadata of academic papers such as titles papers and abstracts this increases the overall number of papers but a significant fraction may not provide free pdf downloads edit re visit policy the web has a very dynamic nature and crawling a fraction of the web can take weeks or months by the time a web crawler has finished its crawl many events could have happened including creations updates and deletions from the search engine s point of view there is a cost associated with not detecting an event and thus having an outdated copy of a resource the most used cost functions are freshness and age 25 freshness this is a binary measure that indicates whether the local copy is accurate or not the freshness of a page p in the repository at time t is defined as age this is a measure that indicates how outdated the local copy is the age of a page p in the repository at time t is defined as coffman et al worked with a definition of the objective of a web crawler that is equivalent to freshness but use a different wording they propose that a crawler must minimize the fraction of time pages remain outdated they also noted that the problem of web crawling can be modeled as a multiple queue single server polling system on which the web crawler is the server and the web sites are the queues page modifications are the arrival of the customers and switch over times are the interval between page accesses to a single web site under this model mean waiting time for a customer in the polling system is equivalent to the average age for the web crawler 26 the objective of the crawler is to keep the average freshness of pages in its collection as high as possible or to keep the average age of pages as low as possible these objectives are not equivalent in the first case the crawler is just concerned with how many pages are out dated while in the second case the crawler is concerned with how old the local copies of pages are two simple re visiting policies were studied by cho and garcia molina 27 uniform policy this involves re visiting all pages in the collection with the same frequency regardless of their rates of change proportional policy this involves re visiting more often the pages that change more frequently the visiting frequency is directly proportional to the estimated change frequency in both cases the repeated crawling order of pages can be done either in a random or a fixed order cho and garcia molina proved the surprising result that in terms of average freshness the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated web and a real web crawl intuitively the reasoning is that as web crawlers have a limit to how many pages they can crawl in a given time frame 1 they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages at the expense of less frequently updating pages and 2 the freshness of rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages in other words a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages but experiences less overall freshness time from them to improve freshness the crawler should penalize the elements that change too often 28 the optimal re visiting policy is neither the uniform policy nor the proportional policy the optimal method for keeping average freshness high includes ignoring the pages that change too often and the optimal for keeping average age low is to use access frequencies that monotonically and sub linearly increase with the rate of change of each page in both cases the optimal is closer to the uniform policy than to the proportional policy as coffman et al note in order to minimize the expected obsolescence time the accesses to any particular page should be kept as evenly spaced as possible 26 explicit formulas for the re visit policy are not attainable in general but they are obtained numerically as they depend on the distribution of page changes cho and garcia molina show that the exponential distribution is a good fit for describing page changes 28 while ipeirotis et al show how to use statistical tools to discover parameters that affect this distribution 29 note that the re visiting policies considered here regard all pages as homogeneous in terms of quality all pages on the web are worth the same something that is not a realistic scenario so further information about the web page quality should be included to achieve a better crawling policy edit politeness policy crawlers can retrieve data much quicker and in greater depth than human searchers so they can have a crippling impact on the performance of a site needless to say if a single crawler is performing multiple requests per second and or downloading large files a server would have a hard time keeping up with requests from multiple crawlers as noted by koster the use of web crawlers is useful for a number of tasks but comes with a price for the general community 30 the costs of using web crawlers include network resources as crawlers require considerable bandwidth and operate with a high degree of parallelism during a long period of time server overload especially if the frequency of accesses to a given server is too high poorly written crawlers which can crash servers or routers or which download pages they cannot handle and personal crawlers that if deployed by too many users can disrupt networks and web servers a partial solution to these problems is the robots exclusion protocol also known as the robots txt protocol that is a standard for administrators to indicate which parts of their web servers should not be accessed by crawlers 31 this standard does not include a suggestion for the interval of visits to the same server even though this interval is the most effective way of avoiding server overload recently commercial search engines like ask jeeves msn and yahoo are able to use an extra crawl delay parameter in the robots txt file to indicate the number of seconds to delay between requests the first proposed interval between connections was 60 seconds 32 however if pages were downloaded at this rate from a website with more than 100 000 pages over a perfect connection with zero latency and infinite bandwidth it would take more than 2 months to download only that entire web site also only a fraction of the resources from that web server would be used this does not seem acceptable cho uses 10 seconds as an interval for accesses 27 and the wire crawler uses 15 seconds as the default 33 the mercatorweb crawler follows an adaptive politeness policy if it took t seconds to download a document from a given server the crawler waits for 10 t seconds before downloading the next page 34 dill et al use 1 second 35 for those using web crawlers for research purposes a more detailed cost benefit analysis is needed and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deciding where to crawl and how fast to crawl 36 anecdotal evidence from access logs shows that access intervals from known crawlers vary between 20 seconds and 3 4 minutes it is worth noticing that even when being very polite and taking all the safeguards to avoid overloading web servers some complaints from web server administrators are received brin and page note that running a crawler which connects to more than half a million servers generates a fair amount of e mail and phone calls because of the vast number of people coming on line there are always those who do not know what a crawler is because this is the first one they have seen 37 edit parallelisation policy main article distributed web crawling a parallel crawler is a crawler that runs multiple processes in parallel the goal is to maximize the download rate while minimizing the overhead from parallelization and to avoid repeated downloads of the same page to avoid downloading the same page more than once the crawling system requires a policy for assigning the new urls discovered during the crawling process as the same url can be found by two different crawling processes edit architectures high level architecture of a standard web crawler a crawler must not only have a good crawling strategy as noted in the previous sections but it should also have a highly optimized architecture shkapenyuk and suel noted that 38 while it is fairly easy to build a slow crawler that downloads a few pages per second for a short period of time building a high performance system that can download hundreds of millions of pages over several weeks presents a number of challenges in system design i o and network efficiency and robustness and manageability web crawlers are a central part of search engines and details on their algorithms and architecture are kept as business secrets when crawler designs are published there is often an important lack of detail that prevents others from reproducing the work there are also emerging concerns about search engine spamming which prevent major search engines from publishing their ranking algorithms edit crawler identification web crawlers typically identify themselves to a web server by using the user agent field of an http request web site administrators typically examine their web servers log and use the user agent field to determine which crawlers have visited the web server and how often the user agent field may include a url where the web site administrator may find out more information about the crawler examining web server log is tedious task therefore some administrators use tools such as crawltrack 39 or seo crawlytics 40 to identify track and verify web crawlers spambots and other malicious web crawlers are unlikely to place identifying information in the user agent field or they may mask their identity as a browser or other well known crawler it is important for web crawlers to identify themselves so that web site administrators can contact the owner if needed in some cases crawlers may be accidentally trapped in a crawler trap or they may be overloading a web server with requests and the owner needs to stop the crawler identification is also useful for administrators that are interested in knowing when they may expect their web pages to be indexed by a particular search engine edit examples this article may contain excessive poor or irrelevant examples please improve the article by adding more descriptive text and removing less pertinent examples see wikipedia s guide to writing better articles for further suggestions may 2012 the following is a list of published crawler architectures for general purpose crawlers excluding focused web crawlers with a brief description that includes the names given to the different components and outstanding features yahoo slurp is the name of the yahoo search crawler bingbot is the name of microsoft s bing webcrawler it replaced msnbot fast crawler 41 is a distributed crawler used by fast search amp transfer and a general description of its architecture is available citation needed googlebot 37 is described in some detail but the reference is only about an early version of its architecture which was based in c and python the crawler was integrated with the indexing process because text parsing was done for full text indexing and also for url extraction there is a url server that sends lists of urls to be fetched by several crawling processes during parsing the urls found were passed to a url server that checked if the url have been previously seen if not the url was added to the queue of the url server polybot 38 is a distributed crawler written in c and python which is composed of a crawl manager one or more downloaders and one or more dns resolvers collected urls are added to a queue on disk and processed later to search for seen urls in batch mode the politeness policy considers both third and second level domains e g www example com and www2 example com are third level domains because third level domains are usually hosted by the same web server rbse 42 was the first published web crawler it was based on two programs the first program spider maintains a queue in a relational database and the second program mite is a modified www ascii browser that downloads the pages from the web webcrawler 19 was used to build the first publicly available full text index of a subset of the web it was based on lib www to download pages and another program to parse and order urls for breadth first exploration of the web graph it also included a real time crawler that followed links based on the similarity of the anchor text with the provided query world wide web worm 43 was a crawler used to build a simple index of document titles and urls the index could be searched by using the grep unix command webfountain 4 is a distributed modular crawler similar to mercator but written in c it features a controller machine that coordinates a series of ant machines after repeatedly downloading pages a change rate is inferred for each page and a non linear programming method must be used to solve the equation system for maximizing freshness the authors recommend to use this crawling order in the early stages of the crawl and then switch to a uniform crawling order in which all pages are being visited with the same frequency webrace 44 is a crawling and caching module implemented in java and used as a part of a more generic system called erace the system receives requests from users for downloading web pages so the crawler acts in part as a smart proxy server the system also handles requests for subscriptions to web pages that must be monitored when the pages change they must be downloaded by the crawler and the subscriber must be notified the most outstanding feature of webrace is that while most crawlers start with a set of seed urls webrace is continuously receiving new starting urls to crawl from in addition to the specific crawler architectures listed above there are general crawler architectures published by cho 45 and chakrabarti 46 edit open source crawlers abot is a c web crawler built for speed and flexibility apache license 2 0 license free for commercial and personal use aspseek is a crawler indexer and a

invisible web 47 these pages are typically only accessible by submitting queries to a database and regular crawlers are unable to find these pages if there are no links that point to them google s sitemaps protocol and mod oai 48 are intended to allow discovery of these deep web resources deep web crawling also multiplies the number of web links to be crawled some crawlers only take some of the lt a 160 href url gt shaped urls in some cases such as the googlebot web crawling is done on all text contained inside the hypertext content tags or text strategic approaches may be taken to target deep web content with a technique called screen scraping specialized software may be customized to automatically and repeatedly query a given web form with the intention of aggregating the resulting data such software can be used to span multiple web forms across multiple websites data extracted from the results of one web form submission can be taken and applied as input to another web form thus establishing continuity across the deep web in a way not possible with traditional web crawlers edit web crawler bias a recent study based on a large scale analysis of robots txt files showed that
