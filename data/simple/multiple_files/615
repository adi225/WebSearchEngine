applies to computer simulated environments that can simulate physical presence in places in the real world as well as in imaginary worlds most current virtual reality environments are primarily visual experiences displayed either on a computer screen or through special stereoscopic displays but some simulations include additional sensory information such as sound through speakers or headphones some advanced haptic systems now include tactile information generally known as force feedback in medical and gaming applications furthermore virtual reality covers remote communication environments which provide virtual presence of users with the concepts of telepresence and telexistence or a virtual artifact va either through the use of standard input devices such as a keyboard and mouse or through multimodal devices such as a wired glove the polhemus and omnidirectional treadmills the simulated environment can be similar to the real world in order to create a lifelike experience for example in simulations for pilot or combat training or it can differ significantly from reality such as in vr games in practice it is currently very difficult to create a high fidelity virtual reality experience due largely to technical limitations on processing power image resolution and communication bandwidth however the technology s proponents hope that such limitations will be overcome as processor imaging and data communication technologies become more powerful and cost effective over time virtual reality is often used to describe a wide variety of applications commonly associated with immersive highly visual 3d environments the development of cad software graphics hardware acceleration head mounted displays database gloves and miniaturization have helped popularize the notion in the book the metaphysics of virtual reality by michael r heim seven different concepts of virtual reality are identified simulation interaction artificiality immersion telepresence full body immersion and network communication people often identify vr with head mounted displays and data suits citation needed the term artificial reality coined by myron krueger has been in use since the 1970s however the origin of the term virtual reality can be traced back to the french playwright poet actor and director antonin artaud in his seminal book the theatre and its double 1938 artaud described theatre as la r alit virtuelle a virtual reality in which in erik davis s words characters objects and images take on the phantasmagoric force of alchemy s visionary internal dramas 1 artaud claimed that the perpetual allusion to the materials and the principle of the theater found in almost all alchemical books should be understood as the expression of an identity existing between the world in which the characters images and in a general way all that constitutes the virtual reality of the theater develops and the purely fictitious and illusory world in which the symbols of alchemy are evolved 2 the term has also been used in the judas mandala a 1982 science fiction novel by damien broderick where the context of use is somewhat different from that defined above the earliest use cited by the oxford english dictionary is in a 1987 article titled virtual reality 3 but the article is not about vr technology the concept of virtual reality was popularized in mass media by movies such as brainstorm and the lawnmower man the vr research boom of the 1990s was accompanied by the non fiction book virtual reality 1991 by howard rheingold 4 the book served to demystify the subject making it more accessible to less technical researchers and enthusiasts multimedia from wagner to virtual reality edited by randall packer and ken jordan and first published in 2001 explores the term and its history from an avant garde perspective philosophical implications of the concept of vr are discussed in books including philip zhai s get real a philosophical adventure in virtual reality 1998 and

example of this would be baldassare peruzzi s piece titled sala delle prospettive in the 1920s vehicle simulators were introduced citation needed morton heilig wrote in the 1950s of an experience theatre that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity he built a prototype of his vision dubbed the sensorama in 1962 along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses sight sound smell and touch predating digital computing the sensorama was a mechanical device which reportedly still functions today around this time douglas englebart uses computer screens as both input and output devices in 1966 thomas a furness iii introduces a visual flight stimulator for the air force in 1968 ivan sutherland with the help of his student bob sproull created what is widely considered to be the first virtual reality and augmented reality ar head mounted display hmd system it was primitive both in terms of user interface and realism and the hmd to be worn by the user was so heavy it had to be suspended from the ceiling the graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple wireframe model rooms the formidable appearance of the device inspired its name the sword of damocles also notable among the earlier hypermedia and virtual reality systems was the aspen movie map which was created at mit in 1977 the program was a crude virtual simulation of aspen colorado in which users could wander the streets in one of three modes summer winter and polygons the first two were based on photographs the researchers actually photographed every possible movement through the city s street grid in both seasons and the third was a basic 3 d model of the city in the late 1980s the term virtual reality was popularized by jaron lanier one of the modern pioneers of the field lanier had founded the company vpl research in 1985 which developed and built some of the seminal goggles and gloves systems of that decade in 1991 antonio medina a mit graduate and nasa scientist designed a virtual reality system to drive mars rovers from earth in apparent real time despite the substantial delay of mars earth mars signals the system termed computer simulated teleoperation as published by rand is an extension of virtual reality 5 edit impact this section is in a list format that may be better presented using prose you can help by converting this section to prose if appropriate editing help is available july 2010 there has been an increase in interest in the potential social impact of new technologies such as virtual reality in the book infinite reality avatars eternal life new worlds and the dawn of the virtual revolution blascovich and bailenson review the literature on the psychology and sociology behind life in virtual reality in addition mychilo s cline in his book power madness and immortality the future of virtual reality argues that virtual reality will lead to a number of important changes in human life and activity 6 he argues that virtual reality will be integrated into daily life and activity and will be used in various human ways another such speculation has been written up on how to reach ultimate happiness via virtual reality 7 techniques will be developed to influence human behavior interpersonal communication and cognition 8 as we spend more and more time in virtual space there will be a gradual migration to virtual space resulting in important changes in economics worldview and culture 9 edit use of vr technology edit heritage and archaeology this section does not cite any references or sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed july 2010 the use of vr in heritage and archaeology has potential in museum and visitor centre applications but its use has been tempered by the difficulty in presenting a quick to learn real time experience to numerous people at any given time many historic reconstructions tend to be in a pre rendered format to a shared video display thus allowing more than one person to view a computer generated world but limiting the interaction that full scale vr can provide citation needed the first use of a vr presentation in a heritage application was in 1994 when a museum visitor interpretation provided an interactive walk through of a 3d reconstruction of dudley castle in england as it was in 1550 this consisted of a computer controlled laserdisc based system designed by british based engineer colin johnson the system was featured in a conference held by the british museum in november 1994 and in the subsequent technical paper imaging the past electronic imaging and computer graphics in museums and archaeology citation needed edit vr reconstruction virtual reality enables heritage sites to be recreated extremely accurately so that the recreations can be published in various media 10 the original sites are often inaccessible to the public or may even no longer exist citation needed this technology can be used to develop virtual replicas of caves natural environment old towns monuments sculptures and archaeological elements

fiction books and films have imagined characters being trapped in virtual reality the otherland series of 4 novels by tad williams set in the 2070 s it shows a world where the internet has become accessible via virtual reality and has become so popular and somewhat commonplace that with the help of surgical implants people can connect directly into this future vr environment the series tells the tale of a group of people while investigating a mysterious illness attacking children while in this world find themselves trapped in a virtual reality system of fantastic detail and sophistication unlike any the world has ever imagined a comprehensive and specific fictional model for virtual reality was published in 1935 in the short story pygmalion s spectacles by stanley g weinbaum in the story the main character dan burke meets an elfin professor albert ludwig who has invented a pair of goggles which enable a movie that gives one sight and sound taste smell and touch you are in the story you speak to the shadows characters and they reply and instead of being on a screen the story is all about you and you are in it a more modern work to use this idea was daniel f galouye s novel simulacron 3 which was made into a german teleplay titled welt am draht world on a wire in 1973 other science fiction books have promoted the idea of virtual reality as a partial but not total substitution for the misery of reality or have touted it as a method for creating breathtaking virtual worlds in which one may escape from earth stanis aw lem wrote a short story in early 1960 called ijon tichy s memories in which he presented a scientist who devised a completely artificial virtual reality among the beings trapped inside his created virtual world there is also a scientist who also devised such machines creating another level of virtual world citation needed lem further explored the implications of what he termed phantomatics in his nonfictional 1964 treatise summa technologiae the piers anthony novel killobyte follows the story of a paralyzed cop trapped in a virtual reality game by a hacker whom he must stop to save a fellow trapped player slowly succumbing to insulin shock this novel toys with the idea of both the potential positive therapeutic uses such as allowing the paralyzed to experience the illusion of movement while stimulating unused muscles as well as virtual realities dangers vernor vinge s true names published in 1981 imagines a virtual world which is probably the first to represent a metaverse in the story characters interact with each other in a complete world where they own homes and are represented using avatars this type of virtual world was later to be realized as second life which was launched in 2003 citation needed other popular fictional works that use the concept of virtual reality include william gibson s neuromancer which defined the concept of cyberspace neal stephenson s snow crash in which he made extensive reference to the term avatar to describe one s representation in a virtual world and rudy rucker s the hacker and the ants in which programmer jerzy rugby uses vr for robot design and testing the doctor who serial the deadly assassin first broadcast in 1976 introduced a dream like computer generated reality known as the matrix the first major american television series to showcase virtual reality regularly was star trek the next generation several episodes featured a holodeck a virtual reality facility that enabled its users to recreate and experience anything they wanted one difference from current virtual reality technology however was that replicators force fields holograms and transporters were used to actually recreate and place objects in the holodeck rather than illusions the new zealand post apocalyptic soap opera the tribe shows virtual reality being used by an advanced enemy tribe named the technos british bbc2 sci fi series red dwarf featured a virtual reality game titled better than life in which the main characters had spent many years connected virtual reality has also been featured in other red dwarf episodes including back to reality where venom from the despair squid caused the characters to believe that all of their experiences on red dwarf had been part of a vr simulation other episodes that feature virtual reality include gunmen of the apocalypse stoke me a clipper blue beyond a joke and back in the red citation needed the popular hack multimedia franchise is based on a virtual reality mmorpg dubbed the world the french animated series code lyoko is based on the virtual world of lyoko and the internet the virtual world is accessed by large scanners which use an atomic process and breaks down the atoms of the person inside digitizes them and recreates an incarnation on lyoko the saban show vr troopers also made use of the concept there is also sword art online s do to onrain a light novel series written by reki kawahara it is about 10 000

road the novel ready player one has a virtual reality system called oasis where the main protagonist spends most of his time edit motion pictures steven lisberger s 1982 film tron explored the idea of virtual reality transporting real life characters into an alternate computer generated world citation needed one year later in 1983 the natalie wood christopher walken film brainstorm revolved around the production use and misuse of a vr device the device could record a person s feelings and experiences and share these with anyone else a vr like system used to record and play back dreams figures centrally in wim wenders 1991 film until the end of the world the 1992 film the lawnmower man which bore little resemblance to the stephen king story on which it was ostensibly based tells the tale of a research scientist who uses a vr system to jumpstart the mental and physical development of his mentally handicapped gardener the 1993 film arcade is centered around a new virtual reality game from which the film gets its name that actively traps those who play it inside its world outside the genre of science fiction 1994 s disclosure starring michael douglas based on the michael crichton s novel depicts a vr headset being used as a navigation device for a prototype computer file system plot of the thirteenth floor 1999 is based on two virtual reality simulations one in another in 1999 the matrix and later sequels explored the possibility that our world is actually a vast virtual reality or more precisely simulated reality created by artificially intelligent machines the 2001 mamoru oshii movie avalon is set in a bleak future where the population is hooked on an immersive illegal virtual reality video game called avalon despite its popularity the game can be deadly leaving players bodies catatonic in the real world one player of the game ash played by polish actress ma gorzata foremniak hears of a secret level hidden within avalon the film follows her quest to find the level in the epic film avatar 2009 the humans are hooked up to experience what their avatars perform remotely ryan chester s virtually reality 2011 depicts a future world in which most natural wonders have been destroyed and developed upon and virtual reality systems provide the only way for humans to experience the nature they never knew for real edit radio in 2009 british digital radio station bbc radio 7 broadcast planet b a science fiction drama set in a virtual world planet b was the largest ever commission for an original drama programme 12 edit fine art david em was the first fine artist to create navigable virtual worlds in the 1970s his early work was done on mainframes at iii jpl and caltech jeffrey shaw explored the potential of vr in fine arts with early works like legible city 1989 virtual museum 1991 and golden calf 1994 canadian artist char davies created immersive vr art pieces osmose 1995 and eph m re 1998 maurice benayoun s work introduced metaphorical philosophical or political content combining vr network generation and intelligent agents in works like is god flat 1994 the tunnel under the atlantic 1995 and world skin 1997 other pioneering artists working in vr have include luc courchesne rita addison knowbotic research rebecca allen perry hoberman jacki morie margaret dolinsky and brenda laurel all mentioned artists are documented in the database of virtual art citation needed edit music immersive virtual musical instruments build on the trend in electronic musical instruments to develop new ways to control sound and perform music such as evidenced by conferences like nime and aim to represent musical events and sound parameters in a virtual reality in such a way that they can be perceived not only through auditory feedback but also visually in 3d and possibly through tactile as well as haptic feedback allowing the development of novel interaction metaphors beyond manipulation such as prehension edit therapeutic uses main article virtual reality therapy the primary use of vr in a therapeutic role is its application to various forms of exposure therapy ranging from phobia treatments to newer approaches to treating ptsd a very basic vr simulation with simple sight and sound models has been shown to be invaluable in phobia treatment like zoophobia and acrophobia as a step between basic exposure therapy such as the use of simulacra and true exposure a much more recent application is being piloted by the u s navy to use a much more complex simulation to immerse veterans suffering from ptsd in simulations of urban combat settings much as in phobia treatment exposure to the subject of the trauma or fear leads to desensitization and a significant reduction in symptoms 13 14 other research fields in which the use of virtual reality is being explored are physical medicine rehabilitation physical therapy and occupational therapy in adult rehabilitation a variety of virtual reality applications are currently being evaluated within upper and lower limb motor rehabilitation for individuals recovering from stroke or spinal cord injury in pediatrics the use of virtual reality is being evaluated to promote movement abilities navigational abilities or social skills in children with cerebral palsy acquired brain injury or other disabilities citation needed research evidence is emerging rapidly in the field of virtual reality for therapeutic uses a number of recent reviews published in peer reviewed journals have summarized the current evidence for the use of virtual reality within pediatric and adult rehabilitation one such review concluded that the field is potentially promising 15 edit training marines training with the future immersive training environment the usage of vr in a training perspective is to allow professionals to conduct training in a virtual environment where they can improve upon their skills without the consequence of failing the operation vr plays an important role in combat training for the military it allows the recruits to train under a controlled environment where they are to respond to different types of combat situations a fully immersive virtual reality that uses head mounted display hmd data suits data glove and vr weapon are used to train for combat this setup allows the training s reset time to be cut down and allows more repetition in a shorter amount of time the fully immersive training environment allows the soldiers to train through a wide variety of terrains situations and scenarios 16 medical personnel are able to train through vr to deal with a wider variety of injuries 17 an experiment was performed by sixteen surgical residents where eight of them went through laparoscopic cholecystectomy through vr training they then came out 29 faster at gallbladder dissection than the controlled group 18 edit implementation to develop a real time virtual environment a computer graphics library can be used as embedded resource coupled with a common programming language such as c perl java or python some of the most popular computer graphic libraries are opengl direct3d java3d and vrml and their use are directly influenced by the system demands in terms of performance program purpose and hardware platform the use of multithreading can also accelerate 3d performance and enable cluster computing with multi user interactivity
