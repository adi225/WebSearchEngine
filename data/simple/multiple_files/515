a search engine is an information retrieval system designed to help find information stored on a computer system the search results are usually presented in a list and are commonly called hits search engines help to minimize the time required to find information and the amount of information which must be consulted akin to other techniques for managing information overload citation needed the most public visible form of a search engine is a web search engine which searches for information on the world wide web edit how search engines work search engines provide an interface to a group of items that enables users to specify criteria about an item of interest and have the engine find the matching items the criteria are referred to as a search query in the case of text search engines the search query is typically expressed as a set of words that identify the desired concept that one or more documents may contain 1 there are several styles of search query syntax that vary in strictness it can also switch names within the search engines from previous sites whereas some text search engines require users to enter two or three words separated by white space other search engines may enable users to specify entire documents pictures sounds and various forms of natural language some search engines apply improvements to search queries to increase the likelihood of providing a quality set of items through a process known as query expansion index based search engine the list of items that meet the criteria specified by the query is typically sorted or ranked ranking items by relevance from highest to lowest reduces the time required to find the desired information probabilistic search engines rank items based on measures of similarity between each item and the query typically on a scale of 1 to 0 1 being most similar and sometimes popularity or authority see bibliometrics or use relevance feedback boolean search engines typically only return items which match exactly without regard to order although the term boolean search engine may simply refer to the use of boolean style syntax the use of operators and or not and xor in a probabilistic context to provide a set of matching items that are sorted according to some criteria quickly a search engine will typically collect metadata about the group of items under consideration beforehand through a process referred to as indexing the index typically requires a smaller amount of computer storage which is why some search engines only store the indexed information and not the full content of each item and instead provide a method of navigating to the items in the search engine result page alternatively the search engine may store a copy of each item in a cache so that users can see the state of the item at the time it was indexed or for archive purposes or to make repetitive processes work more efficiently and quickly other types of search engines do not store an index crawler or spider type search engines a k a real time search engines may collect and assess items at the time of the search query dynamically considering additional items based on the contents of a starting item known as a seed or seed url in the case of an internet crawler meta search engines store neither an index nor a cache and instead simply reuse the index or results of one or more other search engines to provide an aggregated final set of results edit see also computer science portal automatic summarization bibliographic database desktop search enterprise search federated search emanuel goldberg inventor of early search engine human search engine image search index search engine inverted index list of search engines list of enterprise search vendors medical literature retrieval metasearch engine search engine optimization search suggest drop down list selection based search semantic search solver computer science spamdexing sql text mining vertical search video search engine web search engine edit references voorhees e m natural language processing and information retrieval national institute of standards and technology march 2000 v t e internet search types web search engine list collaborative search engine metasearch engine tools local search vertical search search engine marketing search engine optimization search oriented architecture selection based search social search document retrieval text mining web crawler multisearch federated search search aggregator index web indexing focused crawler spider trap robots exclusion standard distributed web crawling web archiving website mirroring software web search query voice search natural language search engine web query classification applications image search video search engine enterprise search semantic search protocols and standards z39 50 search retrieve web service search retrieve via url opensearch representational state transfer website parse template wide area information server see also search engine desktop search online search
