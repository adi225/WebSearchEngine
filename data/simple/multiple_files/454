the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves and thereby reveal themselves selectively the boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals but share basic common themes privacy is sometimes related to anonymity the wish to remain unnoticed or unidentified in the public realm when something is private to a person it usually means there is something within them that is considered inherently special or personally sensitive the degree to which private information is exposed therefore depends on how the public will receive this information which differs between places and over time privacy partially intersects security including for instance the concepts of appropriate use as well as protection of information privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity the right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the government corporations or individuals is part of many countries privacy laws and in some cases constitutions almost all countries have laws which in some way limit privacy an example of this would be law concerning taxation which normally require the sharing of information about personal income or earnings in some countries individual privacy may conflict with freedom of speech laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures privacy may be voluntarily sacrificed normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses although this is a very strategic view of human relationships academics who are economists evolutionary theorists and research psychologists describe revealing privacy as a voluntary sacrifice for instance by willing participants in sweepstakes or competitions in the business world a person may volunteer personal details often for advertising purposes in order to gamble on winning a prize personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to identity theft the concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct associated with western culture english and north american in particular and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times according to some researchers this concept sets anglo american culture apart even from western european cultures such as french or italian 1 most cultures however recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society a figleaf over the genitals being an ancient example the word privacy is an example of an untranslatable lexeme 2 and many languages do not have a specific word for privacy such languages either use a complex description to translate the term such as russian combining the meaning of solitude secrecy and private life or borrow from english privacy as indonesian privasi or italian la privacy 2 contents 1 types of privacy 1

different contexts different people cultures and nations have a wide variety of expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an invasion of privacy edit personal privacy most people have a strong sense of privacy in relation to the exposure of their body to others this is an aspect of personal modesty a person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty the main way being the wearing of clothes other ways include erection of walls fences screens use of cathedral glass partitions by maintaining a distance beside other ways people who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others at the same time people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of physical intimacy but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome physical privacy could be defined as preventing intrusions into one s physical space or solitude 3 this would include such concerns as preventing intimate acts or hiding one s body from others for the purpose of modesty apart from being dressed this can be achieved by walls fences privacy screens cathedral glass partitions between urinals by being far away from others on a bed by a bed sheet or a blanket when changing clothes by a towel etc to what extent these measures also prevent acts being heard varies video of aptly named graphic or intimate acts behaviors or body parts preventing unwelcome searching of one s personal possessions preventing unauthorized access to one s home or vehicle medical privacy the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third party review most widely applied to questions of contraception an example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the us fourth amendment which guarantees the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures 4 most countries have laws regarding trespassing and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity personal dignity and or shyness there may also be concerns about safety if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or stalking 5 civil inattention is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd edit informational main article information privacy information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to or public expectation of privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one s self privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored in digital form or otherwise in some cases these concerns refer to how data is collected stored and associated in other cases the issue is who is given access to information other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them and or the right to view verify and challenge that information various types of personal information are often associated with privacy concerns for various reasons individuals may object to personal information such as their religion sexual orientation political affiliations or personal activities being revealed perhaps to avoid discrimination personal embarrassment or damage to their professional reputations financial privacy in which information about a person s financial transactions is guarded is important for the avoidance of fraud including identity theft information about a person s purchases for instance can reveal a great deal about their preferences places they have visited their contacts products such as medications they use their activities and habits etc internet privacy is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the internet who has access to such information and for what purposes one s information may or may not be used for example web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect store and possibly share personally identifiable information about them similarly internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their email was being accessed read stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent tools used to protect privacy on the internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like i2p and tor medical privacy allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments medical information could also reveal other aspects of one s personal life such as sexual preferences or proclivity a right to sexual privacy enables individuals to acquire and use contraceptives without family community or legal sanctions political privacy has been a concern since voting systems emerged in ancient times the secret ballot helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote secret ballots are nearly universal in modern democracy and considered a basic right of citizenship despite the difficulties that they cause for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks edit organizational governments agencies corporations groups societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals adopting various security practices and controls in order to prevent this organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets for example a government administration may be able to invoke executive privilege 6 or declares certain information to be classified or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as trade secrets 4 edit spiritual and intellectual the earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under british common law which protected only the physical interference of life and property its development from then on became one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law 7 privacy rights gradually expanded to include a recognition of man s spiritual nature of his feelings and his intellect 7 eventually the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic right to be let alone and the former definition of property would then comprise every form of possession intangible as well as tangible by the late 19th century interest in a right to privacy grew as a response to the growth of print media especially newspapers 7 edit history of privacy further information privacy laws of the united states early years edit privacy and technology advertisement for dial telephone service available to delegates to the 1912 republican convention in chicago a major selling point of dial telephone service was that it was secret in that no operator was required to connect the call as technology has advanced the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it in the case of some technologies such as the printing press or the internet the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached it is generally agreed 8 that the first publication advocating privacy in the united states was the article by samuel warren and louis brandeis the right to privacy 4 harvard l r 193 1890 that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies 9 new technologies can also create new ways to gather private information for example in the u s it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana growing operations would be acceptable however in 2001 in kyllo v united states 533 u s 27 it was decided that the use of thermal imaging devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy 10 generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy as large scale information systems become more common there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned the concept of information privacy has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe privacy law in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and to some extent maintain privacy rights but the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient proposals such as the apec privacy framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy edit privacy and the internet main article internet privacy the internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything where every online photo status update twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever writes law professor and author jeffrey rosen 11 this currently has an effect on employment microsoft reports that 75 percent of u s recruiters and human resource professionals now do online research about candidates often using information provided by search engines social networking sites photo video sharing sites personal web sites and blogs and twitter they also report that 70 percent of u s recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information 11 this has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers 11 the ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade facebook for example as of july 2010 was the largest social networking site with nearly 500 million members or 22 percent of all internet users who upload over 25 billion pieces of content each month twitter has more than 100 million registered users the library of congress recently announced that it will be acquiring and permanently storing the entire archive of public twitter posts since 2006 reports rosen 11 according to some experts many commonly used communication devices may be mapping every move of their users senator al franken has noted the seriousness of iphones and ipads having the ability to record and store users locations in unencrypted files 12 although apple denied doing so 13 andrew grove co founder and former ceo of intel corporation offered his thoughts on internet privacy in an interview in 2000 14 privacy is one of the biggest problems in this new electronic age at the heart of the internet culture is a force that wants to find out everything about you and once it has found out everything about you and two hundred million others that s a very valuable asset and people will be tempted to trade and do commerce with that asset this wasn t the information that people were thinking of when they called this the information age edit right to privacy privacy uses the theory of natural rights and generally responds to new information and communication technologies in north america samuel d warren and louis d brandeis wrote that privacy is the right to be let alone warren amp brandeis 1890 focuses on protecting individuals this citation was a response to recent technological developments such as photography and sensationalist journalism also known as yellow journalism warren and brandeis declared that information which was previously hidden and private could now be shouted from the rooftops 15 privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology in his widely cited dissenting opinion in olmstead v united states 1928 brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his harvard law review article in 1890 but in his dissent he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to constitutional law going so far as saying the government was identified as a potential privacy invader he writes discovery and invention have made it possible for the government by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet at that time telephones were often community assets with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators by the time of katz in 1967 telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro mechanical in the 1970s new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy resulting in the fair information practice principles edit definitions in recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a right to privacy some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy should not be defined as a separate legal right at all by their reasoning existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient 16 other experts such as dean prosser have attempted but failed to find a common ground between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system at least to formulate a definition 16 one law school treatise from israel however on the subject of privacy in the digital environment suggests that the right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself it has therefore proposed a working definition for a right to privacy the right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us which includes all those things that are part of us such as our body home property thoughts feelings secrets and identity the right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others and to control the extent manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose 16 edit an individual right alan westin believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes westin defines privacy as the claim of individuals groups or institutions to determine for themselves when how and to what extent information about them is communicated to others westin describes four states of privacy solitude intimacy anonymity reserve these states must balance participation against norms each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives alan westin privacy and freedom 1968 17 under liberal democratic systems privacy creates a space separate from political life and allows personal autonomy while ensuring democratic freedoms of association and expression david flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy he develops data protection as an aspect of privacy which involves the collection use and dissemination of personal information this concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control i ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used 18 richard posner and lawrence lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control posner criticizes privacy for concealing information which reduces market efficiency for posner employment is selling oneself in the labour market which he believes is like selling a product any defect in the product that is not reported is fraud 19 for lessig privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law lessig claims the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right and that individuals should be able to control information about themselves 20 economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain edit a collective value and a human right there have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental human right whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies 21 amitai etzioni suggests a communitarian approach to privacy this requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order 22 etzioni believes that p rivacy is merely one good among many others 23 and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight ibid he claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance 24 priscilla regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy she supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions shared perceptions public values and collective components shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought public values guarantee democratic participation including freedoms of speech and association and limits government power collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided regan s goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making if we did recognize the collective or public good value of privacy as well as the common and public value of privacy those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection 25 leslie regan shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation and ensures human dignity and autonomy privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed and if this is appropriate violations of privacy depend on context the human right to privacy has precedent in the united nations declaration of human rights everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers 26 shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people centered perspective and not through the marketplace 27 edit privacy protection privacy international 2007 privacy ranking green protections and safeguards red endemic surveillance societies edit free market versus consumer protection approaches approaches to privacy can broadly be divided into two categories free market and consumer protection 28 in a free market approach commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree if some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy they will lose market share such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user or by lack of information about actual privacy practices claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify except when they have already been violated in a consumer protection approach in contrast it is acknowledged that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices or may not have reasonable alternatives available in support of this view jensen and potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person 29 therefore this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards edit privacy law main article privacy law privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals while there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries for example the universal declaration of human rights article 12 states no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy family home or correspondence nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks europe for europe article 8 of the european convention on human rights guarantees the right to respect for private and family life one s home and correspondence the european court of human rights in strasbourg has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy citation needed the european union requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy through directives such as the 1995 directive 95 46 ec on the protection of personal data it is regulated in the united kingdom by the data protection act 1998 and in france data protection is also monitored by the cnil a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before them being enacted although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection some studies show that despite the laws there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws 30 united kingdom in the united kingdom it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy an action may be brought under another tort usually breach of confidence and privacy must then be considered under ec law in the uk it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest 31 there is however the information commissioner s office ico an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information they do this by promoting good practice ruling on eligible complaints giving information to individuals and organisations and taking action when the law is broken the relevant uk laws include data protection act 1998 freedom of information act 2000 environmental information regulations 2004 privacy and electronic communications regulations 2003 the ico has also provided a personal information toolkit online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online 32 united states concerning privacy laws of the united states privacy is not guaranteed per se by the constitution of the united states the supreme court of the united states has found that other guarantees have penumbras that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion for example in griswold v connecticut 1965 in the united states the right of freedom of speech granted in the first amendment has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy privacy is regulated in the u s by the privacy act of 1974 and various state laws certain privacy rights have been established in the united states via legislation such as the children s online privacy protection act coppa 33 the gramm leach bliley act glb and the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa canada canadian privacy law is governed federally by multiple acts including the canadian charter of rights and freedoms and the privacy act canada mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations data privacy was first addressed with the personal information protection and electronic documents act and provincial level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations australia in australia there is the privacy act 1988 privacy sector provisions of the act apply to private sector organisations with a link to australia including 1 individuals who collect use or disclose personal information in the course of a business for example a sole trader s business activities will be regulated unless it s a small business but information gathered outside business activities won t be 2 bodies corporate and 3 partnerships unincorporated associations and trusts any act or practice of a partner committee member or trustee is attributed to the organisation organisations outside australia must comply with the provisions in some circumstances sending information out of australia is also regulated 34 edit privacy on the internet main article internet privacy there are many means to protect one s privacy on the internet for example e mails can be encrypted 35 and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like i2p and tor can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the u s federal trade commission 36 although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third party http cookies anthony miyazaki marketing professor at florida international university and privacy scholar warns that the elimination of third party cookie use by web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the web site s use of original domain cookies 37 as of december 2010 the federal trade commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to behavioral advertising 36 another aspect of privacy on the internet relates to online social networking several online social network sites osns are among the top 10 most visited websites globally a review and evalutation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals privacy of online social networking show the following results first adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users second policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on osns third in the case of using osns and its services traditional one dimensional privacy approaches fall short 38 edit privacy and location based services as location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are increasing problems related to user privacy arise since user s position and preferences constitute personal information and improper use of them violates user s privacy several methods to protect user s privacy when using location based services have been proposed including the use of anonymizing servers blurring of information e a methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed to be able to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy 39 users of such services may also choose to display more generic location information i e in the city or philadelphia or work to some of their more casual acquaintances while only displaying specific location information such as their exact address to closer contacts like spouse relatives and good friends in recent years seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and pared with the national do not call registry telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles 40 the efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both federal trade commission and companies like privacystar each year thousands of complaints are filed to the ftc database with the help of companies and consumers edit privacy by design the principle of privacy by design states that privacy and data protection are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of technologies from the early design stage to their deployment use and ultimate disposal edit privacy self synchronization privacy self synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program s maximum success the stakeholders may be customers employees managers executives suppliers partners or investors when self synchronization is reached the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of
