search engine redirects here for other uses see search engine disambiguation a web search engine is software code that is designed to search for information on the world wide web the search results are generally presented in a line of results often referred to as search engine results pages serp s the information may be a specialist in web pages images information and other types of files some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories unlike web directories which are maintained only by human editors search engines also maintain real time information by running

hosted on the cern webserver one historical snapshot from 1992 remains 1 as more webservers went online the central list could not keep up on the ncsa site new servers were announced under the title what s new 2 the very first tool used for searching on the internet was archie 3 the name stands for archive without the v it was created in 1990 by alan emtage bill heelan and j peter deutsch computer science students at mcgill university in montreal the program downloaded the directory listings of all the files located on public anonymous ftp file transfer protocol sites creating a searchable database of file names however archie did not index the contents of these sites since the amount of data was so limited it could be readily searched manually the rise of gopher created in 1991 by mark mccahill at the university of minnesota led to two new search programs veronica and jughead like archie they searched the file names and titles stored in gopher index systems veronica v ery e asy r odent o riented n et wide i ndex to c omputerized a rchives provided a keyword search of most gopher menu titles in the entire gopher listings jughead j onzy s u niversal g opher h ierarchy e xcavation a nd d isplay was a tool for obtaining menu information from specific gopher servers while the name of the search engine archie was not a reference to the archie comic book series veronica and jughead are characters in the series thus referencing their predecessor in the summer of 1993 no search engine existed for the web though numerous specialized catalogues were maintained by hand oscar nierstrasz at the university of geneva wrote a series of perl scripts that periodically mirrored these pages and rewrote them into a standard format this formed the basis for w3catalog the web s first primitive search engine released on september 2 1993 4 in june 1993 matthew gray then at mit produced what was probably the first web robot the perl based world wide web wanderer and used it to generate an index called wandex the purpose of the wanderer was to measure the size of the world wide web which it did until late 1995 the web s second search engine aliweb appeared in november 1993 aliweb did not use a web robot but instead depended on being notified by website administrators of the existence at each site of an index file in a particular format jumpstation released in december 1993 5 used a web robot to find web pages and to build its index and used a web form as the interface to its query program it was thus the first www resource discovery tool to combine the three essential features of a web search engine crawling indexing and searching as described below because of the limited resources available on the platform it ran on its indexing and hence searching were limited to the titles and headings found in the web pages the crawler encountered one of the first all text crawler based search engines was webcrawler which came out in 1994 unlike its predecessors it allowed users to search for any word in any webpage which has become the standard for all major search engines since it was also the first one widely known by the public also in 1994 lycos which started at carnegie mellon university was launched and became a major commercial endeavor soon after many search engines appeared and vied for popularity these included magellan excite infoseek inktomi northern light and altavista yahoo was among the most popular ways for people to find web pages of interest but its search function operated on its web directory rather than its full text copies of web pages information seekers could also browse the directory instead of doing a keyword based search google adopted the idea of selling search terms in 1998 from a small search engine company named goto com this move had a significant effect on the se business which went from struggling to one of the most profitable businesses in the internet 6 in 1996 netscape was looking to give a single search engine an exclusive deal as the featured search engine on netscape s web browser there was so much interest that instead netscape struck deals with five of the major search engines for 5 million a year each search engine would be in rotation on the netscape search engine page the five engines were yahoo magellan lycos infoseek and excite 7 8 search engines were also known as some of the brightest stars in the internet investing frenzy that occurred in the late 1990s 9 several companies entered the market spectacularly receiving record gains during their initial public offerings some have taken down their public search engine and are marketing enterprise only editions such as northern light many search engine companies were caught up in the dot com bubble a speculation driven market boom that peaked in 1999 and ended in 2001 around 2000 google s search engine rose to prominence 10 the company achieved better results for many searches with an innovation called pagerank this iterative algorithm ranks web pages based on the number and pagerank of other web sites and pages that link there on the premise that good or desirable pages are linked to more than others google also maintained a minimalist interface to its search engine in contrast many of its competitors embedded a search engine in a web portal by 2000 yahoo was providing search services based on inktomi s search engine yahoo acquired inktomi in 2002 and overture which owned alltheweb and altavista in 2003 yahoo switched to google s search engine until 2004 when it launched its own search engine based on the combined technologies of its acquisitions microsoft first launched msn search in the fall of 1998 using search results from inktomi in early 1999 the site began to display listings from looksmart blended with results from inktomi for a short time in 1999 msn search used results from altavista were instead in 2004 microsoft began a transition to its own search technology powered by its own web crawler called msnbot microsoft s rebranded search engine bing was launched on june 1 2009 on july 29 2009 yahoo and microsoft finalized a deal in which yahoo search would be powered by microsoft bing technology in 2012 following the april 24 release of google drive google released the beta version of open drive available as a chrome app to enable the search of files in the cloud

challenged and removed october 2012 a search engine operates in the following order web crawling indexing searching 11 web search engines work by storing information about many web pages which they retrieve from the html itself these pages are retrieved by a web crawler sometimes also known as a spider an automated web browser which follows every link on the site exclusions can be made by the use of robots txt the contents of each page are then analyzed to determine how it should be indexed for example words can be extracted from the titles page content headings or special fields called meta tags data about web pages are stored in an index database for use in later queries a query can be a single word the index helps find information as quickly as possible 11 some search engines such as google store all or part of the source page referred to as a cache as well as information about the web pages whereas others such as altavista store every word of every page they find citation needed this cached page always holds the actual search text since it is the one that was actually indexed so it can be very useful when the content of the current page has been updated and the search terms are no longer in it 11 this problem might be considered a mild form of linkrot and google s handling of it increases usability by satisfying user expectations that the search terms will be on the returned webpage this satisfies the principle of least astonishment since the user normally expects that the search terms will be on the returned pages increased search relevance makes these cached pages very useful even beyond the fact that they may contain data that may no longer be available elsewhere citation needed high level architecture of a standard web crawler when a user enters a query into a search engine typically by using keywords the engine examines its index and provides a listing of best matching web pages according to its criteria usually with a short summary containing the document s title and sometimes parts of the text the index is built from the information stored with the data and the method by which the information is indexed 11 as early as 2007 the google com search engine has allowed one to search by date by clicking show search tools in the leftmost column of the initial search results page and then selecting the desired date range citation needed most search engines support the use of the boolean operators and or and not to further specify the search query boolean operators are for literal searches that allow the user to refine and extend the terms of the search the engine looks for the words or phrases exactly as entered some search engines provide an advanced feature called proximity search which allows users to define the distance between keywords 11 there is also concept based searching where the research involves using statistical analysis on pages containing the words or phrases you search for as well natural language queries allow the user to type a question in the same form one would ask it to a human a site like this would be ask com citation needed the usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the result set it gives back while there may be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase some pages may be more relevant popular or authoritative than others most search engines employ methods to rank the results to provide the best results first how a search engine decides which pages are the best matches and what order the results should be shown in varies widely from one engine to another 11 the methods also change over time as internet usage changes and new techniques evolve there are two main types of search engine that have evolved one is a system of predefined and hierarchically ordered keywords that humans have programmed extensively the other is a system that generates an inverted index by analyzing texts it locates this first form relies much more heavily on the computer itself to do the bulk of the work most web search engines are commercial ventures supported by advertising revenue and as a result some employ the practice of allowing advertisers to pay money to have their listings ranked higher in search results search engines that don t accept money for their search results make money by running search related ads alongside the regular search engine results the search engines make money every time someone clicks on one of these ads edit market share this section requires expansion with information about

baidu held a 61 6 market share for web search in july 2009 16 in russian federation yandex holds around 60 of the market share as of april 2012 17 edit search engine bias see also how to use search engines for research although search engines are programmed to rank websites based on their popularity and relevancy empirical studies indicate various political economic and social biases in the information they provide 18 19 these biases could be a direct result of economic and commercial processes e g companies that advertise with a search engine can become also more popular in its organic search results and political processes e g the removal of search results to comply with local laws 20 google bombing is one example of an attempt to manipulate search results for political social or commercial reasons edit customized results and filter bubbles many search engines such as google and bing provide customized results based on the user s activity history this leads to an effect that has been called a filter bubble the term describes a phenomenon in which websites use algorithms to selectively guess what information a user would like to see based on information about the user such as location past click behaviour and search history as a result websites tend to show only information that agrees with the user s past viewpoint effectively isolating the user in a bubble that tends to exclude contrary information prime examples are google s personalized search results and facebook s personalized news stream according to eli pariser who coined the term users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble pariser related an example in which one user searched google for bp and got investment news about british petroleum while another searcher got information about the deepwater horizon oil spill and that the two search results pages were strikingly different 21 22 23 the bubble effect may have negative implications for civic discourse according to pariser 24 since this problem has been identified competing search engines have emerged that seek to avoid this problem by not tracking 25 or bubbling 26
