mining algorithms inside the oracle relational database these implementations are integrated right into the oracle database kernel and operate natively on data stored in the relational database tables this eliminates the need for extraction or transfer of data into standalone mining analytic servers the relational database platform is leveraged to securely manage models and efficiently execute sql queries on large volumes of data the system is organized around a few generic operations providing a general unified interface for data mining functions these operations include functions to create apply test and manipulate data mining models models are created and stored as database objects and their management is done within the database similar to tables views indexes and other database objects in data mining the process of using a model to derive predictions or descriptions of behavior that is yet to occur is called scoring in traditional analytic workbenches a model built in the analytic engine has to be deployed in a mission critical system to score new data or the data is moved from relational tables into the analytical workbench most workbenches offer proprietary scoring interfaces odm simplifies model deployment by offering oracle sql functions to score data stored right in the database this way the user application developer can leverage the full power of oracle sql in terms of the ability to pipeline and manipulate the results over several levels and in terms of parallelizing and partitioning data access for performance models can be created and managed by one of several means oracle data miner is a graphical user interface that steps the user through the process of creating testing and applying models e g along the lines of the crisp dm methodology application and tools developers can embed predictive and descriptive mining capabilities using pl sql or java apis business analysts can quickly experiment with or demonstrate the power of predictive analytics using oracle spreadsheet add in for predictive analytics a dedicated microsoft excel adaptor interface odm offers a choice of well known machine learning approaches such as decision trees naive bayes support vector machines generalized linear model glm for predictive mining association rules k means and orthogonal partitioning 2 3 clustering and non negative matrix factorization for descriptive mining a minimum description length based technique to grade the relative importance of an input mining attributes for a given problem is also provided most oracle data mining functions also allow text mining by accepting text unstructured data attributes as input users do not need to configure text mining options this is handled behind the scenes by the database options database option edit history oracle data mining was first introduced in 2002 and its releases are named according to the corresponding oracle database release oracle data mining 9ir2 9 2 0 1 0 may 2002 oracle

a logical successor of the darwin data mining toolset developed by thinking machines corporation in the mid 1990s and later distributed by oracle after its acquisition of thinking machines in 1999 however the product itself is a complete redesign and rewrite from ground up while darwin was a classic gui based analytical workbench odm offers a data mining development deployment platform integrated into the oracle database along with the oracle data miner gui the oracle data miner 11gr2 new workflow gui was previewed at oracle open world 2009 an updated oracle data miner gui was released in 2012 it is free and is available as an extension to oracle sql developer 3 1 edit functionality as of release 11gr1 oracle data mining contains the following data mining functions data transformation and model analysis data sampling binning discretization and other data transformations model exploration evaluation and analysis feature selection attribute importance minimum

sources and data preparation most oracle data mining functions accept as input one relational table or view flat data can be combined with transactional data through the use of nested columns enabling mining of data involving one to many relationships e g a star schema the full functionality of sql can be used when preparing data for data mining including dates and spatial data oracle data mining distinguishes numerical categorical and unstructured text attributes the product also provides utilities for data preparation steps prior to model building such as outlier treatment discretization normalization and binning sorting in general speak edit graphical user interface oracle data miner oracle data mining can be accessed using oracle data miner a gui client that provides access to the data mining functions and structured templates called mining activities that automatically prescribe the order of operations perform required data transformations and set model parameters the user interface also allows the automated generation of java and or sql code associated with the data mining activities the java code generator is an extension to oracle jdeveloper there is also an independent interface the spreadsheet add in for predictive analytics which enables access to the oracle data mining predictive analytics pl sql package from microsoft excel edit pl sql and java interfaces oracle data mining provides a native pl sql package dbms data mining to create destroy describe apply test export and import models the code below illustrates a typical call to build a classification model begin dbms data mining create model model name gt credit risk model function gt dbms data mining classification data table name gt credit card data case id column name gt customer id target column name gt credit risk settings table name gt credit risk model settings end where credit risk model is the model name built for the express purpose of classifying future customers credit risk based on training data provided in the table credit card data each case distinguished by a unique customer id with the rest of the model parameters specified through the table credit risk model settings oracle data mining also supports a java api consistent with the java data mining jdm standard for data mining jsr 73 for enabling integration with web and java ee applications and to facilitate portability across platforms edit sql scoring functions as of release 10gr2 oracle data mining contains built in sql functions for scoring data mining models these single row functions support classification regression anomaly detection clustering and feature extraction the code below illustrates a typical usage of a classification model select customer name from credit card data

an xml based standard for representing data mining models edit predictive analytics ms excel add in the pl sql package dbms predictive analytics automates the data mining process including data preprocessing model building and evaluation and scoring of new data the predict operation is used for predicting target values classification or regression while explain ranks attributes in order of influence in explaining a target column feature selection the new 11g feature profile finds customer segments and their profiles given a target attribute these operations can be used as part of an
