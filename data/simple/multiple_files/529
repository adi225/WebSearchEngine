sixth normal form 6nf is a term in relational database theory used in two different ways contents 1 6nf c date s definition 2 dknf 3 usage 4 references 5 further reading edit 6nf c date s definition a book by christopher j date and others on temporal databases 1 defined sixth normal form as a normal form for databases based on an extension of the relational algebra in this work the relational operators such as join are generalized to support a natural treatment of interval data such as sequences of dates or moments in time 2 sixth normal form is then based on this generalized join as follows a relvar r table is in sixth normal form abbreviated 6nf if and only if it satisfies no nontrivial join dependencies at all where as before a join dependency is trivial if and only if at least one of the projections possibly u projections involved is taken over the set of all attributes of the relvar table concerned date et al 3 any relation in 6nf is also in 5nf sixth normal form is intended to decompose relation variables to irreducible components though this may be relatively unimportant for non temporal relation variables it can be important when dealing with temporal variables or other interval data for instance if a relation comprises a supplier s name status and city we may also want to add temporal data such as the time during which these values are or were valid e g for historical data but the three values may vary independently of each other and at different rates we may for instance wish to trace the history of changes to status for further discussion on temporal aggregation in sql see also zimanyi 4 for a different approach see tsql2 5 edit dknf some authors use the term sixth normal form differently namely as a synonym for domain key normal form dknf this usage predates date et al s work 6 edit usage the sixth normal form is currently being used in some data warehouses where the benefits outweigh the drawbacks 7 for example using anchor modeling although using 6nf leads to an explosion of tables modern databases can prune the tables from select queries using a process called table elimination where they are not required and thus speed up queries that only access several attributes edit references date et al 2003 op cit chapter 9 generalizing the relational operators op cit section 10 4 p 176 zimanyi 2005 snodgrass richard t tsql2 temporal query language describes history gives references to standard and original book see www dbdebunk com for a discussion on this topic see the anchor modeling website for a website that describes a data warehouse modelling method based on the sixth normal form edit further reading date c j 2006 the relational database dictionary a comprehensive glossary of relational terms and concepts with illustrative examples o reilly series pocket references o reilly media inc p 160 90 isbn 160 978 0 596 52798 3 date chris j hugh darwen nikos a lorentzos january 2003 temporal data and the relational model a detailed investigation into the application of interval and relation theory to the problem of temporal database management oxford elsevier ltd isbn 160 1 55860 855 9 zimanyi e june 2006 temporal aggregates and temporal universal quantification in standard sql pdf acm sigmod record volume 35 number 2 page 16 acm http www sigmod org publications sigmod record 0606 sigmod record june2006 pdf v t e topics in database normalization first normal form second normal form third normal form boyce codd normal form fourth normal form fifth normal form domain key normal form sixth normal form normalization denormalization v t e data warehouse 160 creating the data warehouse concepts database dimension dimensional modeling fact olap star schema aggregate variants anchor modeling column oriented dbms data vault modeling holap molap rolap operational data store elements data dictionary metadata data mart sixth normal form surrogate key fact fact table early arriving fact measure dimension dimension table degenerate slowly changing filling extract transform load etl extract transform load 160 using the data warehouse concepts business intelligence dashboard data mining decision support system dss olap cube languages data mining extensions dmx multidimensional expressions mdx xml for analysis xmla tools business intelligence tools reporting software spreadsheet 160 related people bill inmon ralph kimball products comparison of olap servers data warehousing products and their producers
