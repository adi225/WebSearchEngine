multidimensional expressions mdx is a query language for olap databases much like sql is a query language for relational databases it is also a calculation language with syntax similar to spreadsheet formulas contents 1 background 2 history 2 1 mdxml 3 mdx data types 4 example query 5 references 6 external references edit background the multidimensional expressions mdx language provides a specialized syntax for querying and manipulating the multidimensional data stored in olap cubes 1 while it is possible to translate some of these into traditional sql it would frequently require the synthesis of clumsy sql expressions even for very simple mdx expressions mdx has been embraced by a wide majority of olap vendors and has become the standard for olap systems edit history mdx was first introduced as part of the ole db for olap specification in 1997 from microsoft it was invented by the group of sql server engineers including mosha pasumansky the specification was quickly followed by commercial release of microsoft olap services 7 0 in 1998 and later by microsoft analysis services the latest version of the ole db for olap specification was issued by microsoft in 1999 while it was not an open standard but rather a microsoft owned specification it was adopted by the wide range of olap vendors this included both vendors on the server side such as applix iccube microstrategy ncr oracle corporation sas sap teradata whitelight and vendors on the client side such as panorama software powerolap xlcubed proclarity appsource jaspersoft cognos business objects brio technology crystal reports microsoft excel and microsoft reporting services with the invention of xml for analysis which standardized mdx as a query language even more companies such as hyperion solutions began supporting mdx the xml for analysis specification referred back to the ole db for olap specification for details on the mdx query language in analysis services 2005 microsoft has added some mdx query language extensions like subselects products like microsoft excel 2007 have started to use these new mdx query language extensions some refer to this newer variant of mdx as mdx 2005 edit mdxml in 2001 the xmla council released the xml for analysis standard which included mdxml as a query language in the current xmla 1 1 specification mdxml is essentially mdx wrapped in the xml lt statement gt tag edit mdx data types there are six primary data types in mdx scalar scalar is either a number or a string it can be specified as a literal e g number 5 or string olap or it can be returned by an mdx function e g aggregate number uniquename string value number or string etc dimension hierarchy dimension is a dimension of a cube a dimension is a primary organizer of measure and attribute information in a cube mdx does not know of nor does it assume any dependencies between dimensions they are assumed to be mutually independent a dimension will contain some members see below organized in some hierarchy or hierarchies containing levels it can be specified by its unique name e g time or it can be returned by an mdx function e g dimension hierarchy is a dimension hierarchy of a cube it can be specified by its unique name e g time fiscal or it can be returned by an mdx function e g hierarchy hierarchies are contained within dimensions oledb for olap mdx specification does not distinguish between dimension and hierarchy data types some implementations such as microsoft analysis services treat them differently level level is a level in a dimension hierarchy it can be specified by its unique name e g time fiscal month or it can be returned by an mdx function e g level member member is a member in a dimension hierarchy it can be specified by its unique name e g time fiscal month august 2006 by qualified name e g time fiscal 2006 q2 august 2006 or returned by an mdx function e g prevmember parent firstchild etc note that all members are specific to a hierarchy if the self same product is a member of two different hierarchy product bymanufacturer and product bycategory there will be two different members visible that may need to be coordinated in sets and tuples see below tuple tuple is an ordered collection of one or more members from different dimensions tuples can be specified enumerating the members e g time fiscal month august customer by geography all customers usa measures sales or returned by an mdx function e g item set set is an ordered collection of tuples with the same dimensionality or hierarchality in the case of microsoft s implementation it can be specified enumerating the tuples e g measures sales time fiscal 2006 measures sales time fiscal 2007 or returned by mdx function or operator e g crossjoin filter order descendants etc other data types member properties are equivalent to attributes in the data warehouse sense they can be retrieved by name in a query through an axis properties clause of a query the scalar data value of a member property for some member can be accessed in an expression through mdx either by naming the property for example product currentmember sales price or by using a special access function for example product currentmember properties sales price in limited contexts mdx allows other data types as well for example array can be used inside the settoarray function to specify an array that is not processed by mdx but passed to a user defined function in an activex library objects of other data types are represented as scalar strings indicating the object names such as measure group name in microsoft s measuregroupmeasures function or kpi name in for example microsoft s kpivalue or kpigoal functions edit example query the following example adapted from the sql server 2000 books online shows a basic mdx query that uses the select statement this query returns a result set that contains the 2002 and 2003 store sales amounts for stores in the state of california select measures store sales on columns date 2002 date 2003 on rows from sales where store usa ca in this example the query defines the following result set information the select clause sets the query axes as the store sales member of the measures dimension and the 2002 and 2003 members of the date dimension the from clause indicates that the data source is the sales cube the where clause defines the slicer axis as the california member of the store dimension note you can specify up to 128 query axes in an mdx query edit references carl nolan manipulate and query olap data using
