jacquard looms in masson mill the jacquard loom is a mechanical loom invented by joseph marie jacquard first demonstrated in 1801 that simplifies the process of manufacturing textiles with complex patterns such as brocade damask and matelasse 1 2 the loom was controlled by a chain of cards a number of punched cards laced together into a continuous sequence 3 multiple rows of holes were punched on each card and each row of punched holes corresponded to one row of the design several such paper cards generally white in color can be seen in the images below chains like the much later paper tape allowed sequences of any length to be constructed not limited by the size of a card it is based on earlier inventions by the frenchmen basile bouchon 1725 jean baptiste falcon 1728 and jacques vaucanson 1740 4 a static display of a jacquard loom is the centrepiece of the mus e des tissus et des arts d coratifs 5 in lyon live displays of a jacquard loom are available at a few private museums

silk on a jacquard loom and required 24 000 punched cards to create 1839 it was only produced to order charles babbage owned one of these portraits it inspired him in using perforated cards in his analytical engine 7 it is in the collection of the science museum in london england 8 each position in the card corresponds to a bolus hook which can either be raised or stopped dependent on whether the hole is punched out of the card or the card is solid the hook raises or lowers the harness which carries and guides the warp thread so that the weft will either lie above or below it the sequence of raised and lowered threads is what creates the pattern each hook can be connected to a number of threads allowing more than one repeat of a pattern a loom with a 400 hook head might have four threads connected to each hook resulting in a fabric that is 1600 warp ends wide with four repeats of the weave going across the term jacquard loom is a misnomer it is the jacquard head that adapts to a great many dobby looms such as the dornier brand that allow the weaving machine to then create the intricate patterns often seen in jacquard weaving jacquard looms whilst relatively common in the textile industry are not as ubiquitous as dobby looms which are usually faster and much cheaper to operate however unlike jacquard looms they are not capable of producing so many different weaves from one warp modern jacquard looms are controlled by computers in place of the original punched cards and can have thousands of hooks the threading of a jacquard loom is so labor intensive that many looms are threaded only once subsequent warps are then tied in to the existing warp with the help of a knotting robot which ties each new thread on individually even for a small loom with only a few thousand warp ends the process of re threading can take days edit importance to computing this article appears to contradict the article basile bouchon please see discussion on the linked talk page please do not remove this message until the contradictions are resolved january 2013 the jacquard loom was the first machine to use punched cards to control a sequence of operations although it did no computation based on them it is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware 9 the ability to change the pattern of the loom s weave by simply changing cards was an important conceptual precursor to the development of computer programming specifically charles babbage planned to use cards to store programs in his analytical engine austrian jacquard handloom end of 19th
