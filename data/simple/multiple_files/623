process of collecting portions of the world wide web and ensuring the collection is preserved in an archive such as an archive site for future researchers historians and the public due to the massive size of the web web archivists typically employ web crawlers for automated collection the largest web archiving organization based on a crawling approach is the internet archive which strives to maintain an archive of the entire web national libraries national archives and various consortia of organizations are also involved in archiving culturally important web content commercial web

they also archive metadata about the collected resources such as access time mime type and content length this metadata is useful in establishing authenticity and provenance of the archived collection edit methods of collection edit remote harvesting the most common web archiving technique uses web crawlers to automate the process of collecting web pages web crawlers typically view web pages in the same manner that users with a browser see the web and therefore provide a comparatively simple method of remotely harvesting web content examples of web crawlers used for web archiving include automated internet sessions in biterscripting heritrix httrack wget edit on demand there are numerous services that may be used to archive web resources on demand using web crawling techniques aleph

technology edit database archiving database archiving refers to methods for archiving the underlying content of database driven websites it typically requires the extraction of the database content into a standard schema often using xml once stored in that standard format the archived content of multiple databases can then be made available using a single access system this approach is exemplified by the deeparc and xinq tools developed by the biblioth que nationale de france and the national library of australia respectively deeparc enables the structure of a relational database to be mapped to an xml schema and the content exported into an xml document xinq then allows that content to be delivered online although the original layout and behavior of the website cannot be preserved exactly xinq does allow the basic querying and retrieval functionality to be replicated edit transactional archiving transactional archiving is an event driven approach which collects the actual transactions which take place between a web server and a web browser it is primarily used as a means of preserving evidence of the content which was actually viewed on a particular website on a given date this may be particularly important for organizations which need to comply with legal or regulatory requirements for disclosing and retaining information a transactional archiving system typically operates by intercepting every http request to and response from the web server filtering each response to eliminate duplicate content and permanently storing the responses as bitstreams a transactional archiving system requires the installation of software on the web server and cannot therefore be used to collect content from a remote website edit difficulties and limitations edit crawlers web archives which rely on web crawling as their primary means of collecting the web are influenced by the difficulties of web crawling the robots exclusion protocol may request crawlers not access portions of a website some web archivists may ignore the request and crawl those portions anyway large portions of a web site may be hidden in the deep web for example the results page behind a web form lies in the deep web because most crawlers cannot follow a link to the results page crawler traps e g calendars may cause a crawler to download an infinite number of pages so crawlers are usually configured to limit the number of dynamic pages they crawl however it is important to note that a native format web archive i e a fully browsable web archive with working links media etc is only really possible using crawler technology the web is so large that crawling a significant portion of it takes a large amount of technical resources the web is changing so fast that portions of a website may change before a crawler has even finished crawling it edit general limitations some web servers are configured to return different pages to web archiver requests than they would in response to regular browser requests this is typically done to fool search engines into directing more user traffic to a website and is often done to avoid accountability or to provide enhanced content only to those browsers that can display it not only must web archivists deal with the technical challenges of web archiving they must also contend with intellectual property laws peter lyman 3 states that although the web is popularly regarded as a public domain resource it is copyrighted thus archivists have no legal right to copy the web however national libraries in many countries do have a legal right to copy portions of the web under an extension of a legal deposit some private non profit web archives that are made publicly accessible like webcite the internet archive or internet memory allow content owners to hide or remove archived content that they do not want the public to have access to other web archives are only accessible from certain locations or have regulated usage webcite cites a recent lawsuit against google s caching which google won 4 edit aspects of web curation web curation like any digital curation entails certification of the trustworthiness and integrity of the collection content collecting verifiable web assets providing web asset search and retrieval semantic and ontological continuity and comparability of the collection content thus besides the discussion on methods of collecting the web those of providing access certification and organizing must be included there are a set of popular tools that addresses
