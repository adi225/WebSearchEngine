in statistics the f 1 score also f score or f measure is a measure of a test s accuracy it considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score p is the number of correct results divided by the number of all returned results and r is the number of correct results divided by the number of results that should have been returned the f 1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall where an f 1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0 the traditional f measure or balanced f score f 1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall the general formula for positive real is the formula in terms of type i and type ii errors two other commonly used f measures are the measure which weights recall higher than precision and the measure which puts more emphasis on precision than recall the f measure was derived so that measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches times as much importance to recall as precision 1 it is based on van rijsbergen s effectiveness measure their relationship is where edit applications the f score is often used in the field of information retrieval for measuring search document classification and query classification performance 2 earlier works focused primarily on the f 1 score but with the proliferation of large scale search engines performance goals changed to place more emphasis on either precision or recall 3 and so is seen in wide application the f score is also used in machine learning 4 note however that the f measures do not take the true negative rate into account and that measures such as the matthews correlation coefficient may be preferable to assess the performance of a binary classifier citation needed edit see also precision and recall bleu nist metric meteor rouge metric word error rate wer noun phrase chunking receiver operating characteristic matthews correlation coefficient edit references van rijsbergen c j 1979 information retrieval 2nd ed butterworth beitzel steven m 2006 on understanding and classifying web queries ph d thesis iit citeseerx 10 1 1 127 634 x li y y wang and a acero july 2008 learning query intent from regularized click graphs proceedings of the 31st sigir conference see e g the evaluation of the conll 2002 shared task this statistics related article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e
