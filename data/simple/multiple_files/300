requirement for freedom of thought and conscience freedom of thought and freedom of expression are necessary conditions for freedom of access to information 4 individual national library associations expand upon these principles when defining intellectual freedom for their constituents for example the american library association s intellectual freedom q amp a defines intellectual freedom as t he right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction it provides for free access to all expressions of ideas through which any and all sides of a

governments often claim to have nominal intellectual freedom although the degree of freedom is a matter of dispute the former ussr for example claimed to provide intellectual freedom but some analysts in the west have stated that the degree of intellectual freedom was nominal at best 11 10 edit intellectual freedom in democratic countries during times of crises during times of crises there is often debate within democratic countries as to the balance between national security a successful conclusion to the crises and the maintenance of democratic civil liberties this debate often takes the form of to what extent a democratic government can curtail civil liberties in the interest of successfully ending the crises such a debate existed in canada during the second world war since the first world war the war measures act had existed as legislation in canada to allow the government to operate with greater powers during times of national crises such as in wartime during the second world war the federal liberal government of prime minister william lyon mackenzie king enacted the measure by order in council the war measures act and with it the defence of canada regulations were passed by the federal government in early september 1939 with their implementation civil liberties especially the intellectual freedom of political dissenters were curtailed 12 as well in quebec the union nationale government of premier maurice duplessis enacted an act respecting communist propaganda which came to be known as the padlock act it gave premier duplesis as attorney general of quebec the power to close hence padlock any premises used for the purposes of propagating communism or bolshevism the act was criticized by eugene forsey for example as being far too broad in definition and that it gave the premier the power to suppress any opinions that he wished to forsey cited examples of such abuse in the canadian forum 13 all of these measures were criticized by writers in the canadian forum such as eugene forsey 14 and frank r scott and by the league for social reconstruction in general a group to which both forsey and scott belonged indeed during the second world war the canadian forum printed an anonymous monthly column outlining civil liberties abuses by canadian authorities 15 edit see also freedom of thought information wants to be free edit references universal
