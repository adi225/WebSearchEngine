open directory project url dmoz org commercial no type of site web directory registration optional content license creative commons attribution 3 0 unported owner netscape aol created by netscape launched june 5 1998 alexa rank 972 february 2013 update 1 the open directory project odp also known as dmoz from directory mozilla org its original domain name is a multilingual open content directory of world wide web links it is owned by netscape but it is constructed and maintained by a community of volunteer editors odp uses a hierarchical ontology scheme for organizing site listings listings on a similar topic are grouped into categories which can then include smaller categories contents 1 project information 1 1 system failure and editing outage october to december 2006 1 2 competing and spinoff projects 2 content 2 1 maintenance 2 2 license and requirements 2 3 rdf dumps 2 4 content users 3 policies and procedures 3 1 site submissions 4 controversy and criticism 4 1

while they were both working as engineers for sun microsystems chris tolles who worked at sun microsystems as the head of marketing for network security products also signed on in 1998 as a co founder of gnuhoo along with co founders bryn dole and jeremy wenokur skrenta had developed tass an ancestor of tin the popular threaded usenet newsreader for unix systems coincidentally the original category structure of the gnuhoo directory was based loosely on the structure of usenet newsgroups then in existence the gnuhoo directory went live on june 5 1998 after a slashdot article suggested that gnuhoo had nothing in common with the spirit of free software 2 for which the gnu project was known richard stallman and the free software foundation objected to the use of gnu so gnuhoo was changed to newhoo yahoo then objected to the use of hoo in the name prompting them to switch the name again zurl was the likely choice 3 however before the switch to zurl newhoo was acquired by netscape communications corporation in october 1998 and became the open directory project netscape released the odp data under the open directory license netscape was acquired by aol shortly thereafter and odp was one of the assets included in the acquisition aol later merged with time warner odp size by date by the time netscape assumed stewardship the open directory project had about 100 000 urls indexed with contributions from about 4500 editors on october 5 1999 the number of urls indexed by odp reached one million according to an unofficial estimate the urls in the open directory numbered 1 6 million in april 2000 surpassing those in the yahoo directory 4 odp achieved the milestones of indexing two million urls on august 14 2000 three million listings on november 18 2001 and four million on december 3 2003 from january 2006 the open directory published online reports to inform the public about the development of the project the first report covered the year 2005 monthly reports were issued subsequently until september 2006 5 these reports gave greater insight into the functioning of the directory than the simplified statistics given on the front page of the directory the number of listings and categories cited on the front page include test and bookmarks categories but these are not included in the rdf dump offered to users the total number of editors who have contributed to the directory as of march 31 2007 was 75 151 6 there were about 7330 active editors during august 2006 5 edit system failure and editing outage october to december 2006 on october 20 2006 the odp s main server suffered a catastrophic failure of the system 7 that prevented editors from working on the directory until december 18 2006 during that period an older build of the directory was visible to the public on january 13 2007 the site suggestion and update listings forms were again made available 8 on january 26 2007 weekly publication of rdf dumps resumed to avoid future outages the system now resides on a redundant configuration of two intel based servers 9 edit competing and spinoff projects as the odp became more widely known two other major web directories edited by volunteers and sponsored by go com and zeal emerged both now defunct these directories did not license their content for open content distribution 10 11 the concept of using a large scale community of editors to compile online content has been successfully applied to other types of projects odp s editing model directly inspired three other open content volunteer projects an open content restaurant directory known as chefmoz 12 and an encyclopedia known as open site 13 edit content open directory project front page january 2006 gnuhoo borrowed the basic outline for its initial ontology from usenet in 1998 rich skrenta said i took a long list of groups and hand edited them into a hierarchy 14 for example the topic covered by the comp ai alife newsgroup was represented by the category computers ai artificial life the original divisions were for adult arts business computers games health home news recreation reference regional science shopping society and sports while these fifteen top level categories have remained intact the ontology of second and lower level categories has undergone a gradual evolution significant changes are initiated by discussion among editors and then implemented when consensus has been reached in july 1998 the directory became multilingual with the addition of the world top level category the remainder of the directory lists only english language sites by may 2005 seventy five languages were represented the growth rate of the non english components of the directory has been greater than the english component since 2002 while the english component of the directory held almost 75 of the sites in 2003 the world level grew to over 1 5 million sites as of may 2005 forming roughly one third of the directory the ontology in non english categories generally mirrors that of the english directory although exceptions which reflect language differences are quite common several of the top level categories have unique characteristics the adult category is not present on the directory homepage but it is fully available in the rdf dump that odp provides while the bulk of the directory is categorized primarily by topic the regional category is categorized primarily by region this has led many to view odp as two parallel directories regional and topical on november 14 2000 a special directory within the open directory was created for people under 18 years of age 15 key factors distinguishing this kids and teens area from the main directory are stricter guidelines which limit the listing of sites to those which are targeted or appropriate for people under 18 years of age 16 category names as well as site descriptions use vocabulary which is age appropriate age tags on each listing distinguish content appropriate for kids age 12 and under teens 13 to 15 years old and mature teens 16 to 18 years old kids and teens content is available as a separate rdf dump editing permissions are such that the community is parallel to that of the open directory by may 2005 this portion of the open directory included over 32 000 site listings since early 2004 the whole site has been in utf 8 encoding prior to this the encoding used to be iso 8859 1 for english language categories and a language dependent character set for other languages the rdf dumps have been encoded in utf 8 since early 2000 edit maintenance directory listings are maintained by editors while some editors focus on the addition of new listings others focus on maintaining the existing listings this includes tasks such as the editing of individual listings to correct spelling and or grammatical errors as well as monitoring the status of linked sites still others go through site submissions to remove spam and duplicate submissions robozilla is a web crawler written to check the status of all sites listed in odp periodically robozilla will flag sites which appear to have moved or disappeared and editors follow up to check the sites and take action this process is critical for the directory in striving to achieve one of its founding goals to reduce the link rot in web directories shortly after each run the sites marked with errors are automatically moved to the unreviewed queue where editors may investigate them when time permits due to the popularity of the open directory and its resulting impact on search engine rankings see pagerank domains with lapsed registration that are listed on odp have attracted domain hijacking an issue that has been addressed by regularly removing expired domains from the directory while corporate funding and staff for the odp have diminished in recent years volunteers have created editing tools such as linkcheckers to supplement robozilla category crawlers spellcheckers search tools that directly sift a recent rdf dump bookmarklets to help automate some editing functions mozilla based add ons 17 and tools to help work through unreviewed queues edit license and requirements odp data was previously made available under the terms of the open directory license which required a specific odp attribution table on every web page that uses the data the open directory license also included a requirement that users of the data continually check the odp site for updates and discontinue use and distribution of the data or works derived from the data once an update occurs this restriction prompted the free software foundation to refer to the open directory license as a non free documentation license citing the right to redistribute a given version not being permanent and the requirement to check for changes to the license 18 in 2011 the odp silently changed its license to a creative commons attribution license edit rdf dumps this section may be too technical for most readers to understand please help improve this section to make it understandable to non experts without removing the technical details the talk page may contain suggestions january 2013 odp data is made available through an rdf like dump that is published on a dedicated download server where an archive of previous versions is also available 19 new versions are usually generated weekly an odp editor has catalogued a number of bugs that are were encountered when implementing the odp rdf dump including utf 8 encoding errors fixed since august 2004 and an rdf format that does not comply with the final rdf specification because odp rdf generation was implemented before the rdf specification was finalized 20 so while today the so called rdf dump is valid xml it is not strictly rdf but an odp specific format and as such software to process the odp rdf dump needs to take account of this edit content users odp data powers the core directory services for many of the web s largest search engines and portals including netscape search aol search and alexa google directory used odp information until being shuttered in july 2011 21 other uses are also made of odp data for example in the spring of 2004 overture announced a search service for third parties combining yahoo directory search results with odp titles descriptions and category metadata the search engine gigablast announced on may 12 2005 its searchable copy of the open directory the technology permits search of websites listed in specific categories in effect instantly creating over 500 000 vertical search engines 22 as of 8 september 2006 160 2006 09 08 update the odp listed 313 english language web sites that use odp data as well as 238 sites in other languages 23 however these figures do not reflect the full picture of use as those sites that use odp data without following the terms of the odp license are not listed edit policies and procedures there are restrictions imposed on who can become an odp editor the primary gatekeeping mechanism is an editor application process wherein editor candidates demonstrate their editing abilities disclose affiliations that might pose a conflict of interest and otherwise give a sense of how the applicant would likely mesh with the odp culture and mission 24 a majority of applications are rejected but reapplying is allowed and sometimes encouraged the same standards apply to editors of all categories and subcategories odp s editing model is a hierarchical one upon becoming editors individuals will generally have editing permissions in only a small category once they have demonstrated basic editing skills in compliance with the editing guidelines they are welcome to apply for additional editing privileges in either a broader category or in a category elsewhere in the directory mentorship relationships between editors are encouraged and internal forums provide a vehicle for new editors to ask questions odp has its own internal forums the contents of which are intended only for editors to communicate with each other primarily about editing topics access to the forums requires an editor account and editors are expected to keep the contents of these forums private 25 over time senior editors may be granted additional privileges which reflect their editing experience and leadership within the editing community the most straightforward are editall privileges which allow an editor to access all categories in the directory meta privileges additionally allow editors to perform tasks such as reviewing editor applications setting category features and handling external and internal abuse reports cateditall privileges are similar to editall but only for a single directory category similarly catmod privileges are similar to meta but only for a single directory category catmv privileges allow editors to make changes to directory ontology by moving or renaming categories all of these privileges are granted by admins and staff usually after discussion with meta editors in august 2004 a new level of privileges called admin was introduced administrator status was granted to a number of long serving metas by staff administrators have the ability to grant editall privileges to other editors and to approve new directory wide policies powers which had previously only been available to root staff editors 26 a full list of senior editors is available to the public 27 as is a listing of all current editors 28 all odp editors are expected to abide by odp s editing guidelines these guidelines describe editing basics which types of sites may be listed and which may not how site listings should be titled and described in a loosely consistent manner conventions for the naming and building of categories conflict of interest limitations on the editing of sites which the editor may own or otherwise be affiliated with and a code of conduct within the community 29 editors who are found to have violated these guidelines may be contacted by staff or senior editors have their editing permissions cut back or lose their editing privileges entirely odp guidelines are periodically revised after discussion in editor forums edit site submissions one of the original motivations for forming gnuhoo newhoo odp was the frustration that many people experienced in getting their sites listed on yahoo directory however yahoo has since implemented a paid service for timely consideration of site submissions that lead has been followed by many other directories some accept no free submissions at all by contrast the odp has maintained its policy of free site submissions for all types of site the only one of the major general directories to do so one result has been a gradual divergence between the odp and other directories in the balance of content the pay for inclusion model favours those able and willing to pay so commercial sites tend to predominate in directories using it 30 conversely a directory manned by volunteers will reflect the aims and interests of those volunteers the odp lists a high proportion of informational and non profit sites another consequence of the free submission policy is that the odp has enormous numbers of submissions still waiting for review in large parts those consist of spam and incorrectly submitted sites 31 so the average processing time for a site submission has grown longer with each passing year however the time taken cannot be predicted since the variation is so great a submission might be processed within hours or take several years 32 however site suggestions are just one of many sources of new listings editors are under no obligation to check them for new listings and are actually encouraged to use other sources 32 33 edit controversy and criticism there have long been allegations that volunteer odp editors give favorable treatment to their own websites while concomitantly thwarting the good faith efforts of their competition 34 such allegations are fielded by odp s staff and meta editors who have the authority to take disciplinary action against volunteer editors who are suspected of engaging in abusive editing practices 35 in 2003 odp introduced a new public abuse report system that allows members of the general public to report and track allegations of abusive editor conduct using an online form 36 uninhibited discussion of odp s purported shortcomings has become more common on mainstream webmaster discussion forums although site policies suggest that an individual site should be submitted to only one category 37 as of october 2007 topix com a news aggregation site operated by odp founder rich skrenta has more than 17 000 listings 38 early in the history of the odp its staff gave representatives of selected companies such as rolling stone or cnn editing access in order to list individual pages from their websites 39 links to individual cnn articles have been added until 2004 and have been entirely removed from the directory in january 2008 40 due to being outdated and not considered worth the effort to maintain such experiments have not been repeated later edit ownership and management underlying some controversy surrounding odp is its ownership and management some of the original gnuhoo volunteers felt that they had been deceived into joining a commercial enterprise 2 to varying degrees those complaints have continued up until the present at odp s inception there was little thought given to the idea of how odp should be managed and there were no official forums guidelines or faqs in essence odp began as a free for all 41 as time went on the odp editor forums became the de facto odp parliament and when one of odp s staff members would post an opinion in the forums it would be considered an official ruling 25 even so odp staff began to give trusted senior editors additional editing privileges including the ability to approve new editor applications which eventually led to a stratified hierarchy of duties and privileges among odp editors with odp s paid staff having the final say regarding odp s policies and procedures 26 42 robert keating a principal of touchstone consulting group in washington d c since 2006 has worked as aol s program manager for odp since 2004 he started working for aol in 1999 as senior editor for aol search then as managing editor aol search odp and then as media ecosystem manager aol product marketing 43 44 edit editor removal procedures odp s editor removal procedures are overseen by odp s staff and meta editors according to odp s official editorial guidelines editors are removed for abusive editing practices or uncivil behaviour discussions that may result in disciplinary action against volunteer editors take place in a private forum which can only be accessed by odp s staff and meta editors volunteer editors who are being discussed are not given notice that such proceedings are taking place 42 some people find this arrangement distasteful wanting instead a discussion modelled more like a trial held in the u s judicial system 45 in the article editor removal explained odp meta editor arlarson states that a great deal of confusion about the removal of editors from odp results from false or misleading statements by former editors 46 the odp s confidentiality guidelines prohibit any current odp editors in a position to know anything from discussing the reasons for specific editor removals 42 however a generic list of reasons is for example given in the guidelines 47 in the past this has led to removed odp editors wondering why they cannot login at odp to perform their editing work 48 49 edit allegations that editors are removed for criticizing policies david f prenatt jr former odp editor netesq and the former editor known by the alias the cunctator claim to have been removed for disagreeing with staff about changes to the policies with special regard to the odp s copyright policies according to their claims staff used the excuse that their behaviour was uncivil to remove bothersome editors 45 50 51 edit blacklisting allegations senior odp editors have the ability to attach warning or do not list notes to individual domains but no editor has the unilateral ability to block certain sites from being listed sites with these notes might still be listed and at times notes are removed after some discussion 52 edit hierarchical structure recently criticism of odp s hierarchical structure emerged many believe hierarchical directories are too complicated as the recent emergence of web 2 0 folksonomies began to appear these people thought folksonomies networks and directed graph are more natural and easier to manage than hierarchies 53 54 55 edit software edit search the odpsearch software is a derivative version of isearch which is open source licensed under the mozilla public license 56 edit editor forums the odp editor forums were originally run on software that was based on the proprietary ultimate bulletin board system in june 2003 they switched to the open source phpbb system as of 2007 these forums are powered by a modified version of phpbb edit bug tracking the bug tracking software used by the odp is bugzilla and the web server apache squid web proxy server was also used but it was removed in august 2007 when the storage servers were reorganized all these applications are open source edit interface the odp database editing software is closed source although richard skrenta of odp did say in june 1998 that he was considering licensing it under the gnu general public license this has led to criticism from the aforementioned gnu project many of whom also criticise the odp content license 57 as such there have been some efforts to provide alternatives to odp these alternatives would allow communities of like minded editors to set up and maintain their own open source open content web directories however no significant open source open content alternative to odp has emerged edit
