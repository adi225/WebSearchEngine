for other uses see software disambiguation a software engineer programming for the wikimedia foundation computer software or just software is a collection of computer programs and related data that provides the instructions for telling a computer what to do and how to do it software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer in other words software is a set of programs procedures algorithms and its documentation concerned with the operation of a data processing system program software performs the function of the program it implements either by directly providing instructions to the digital electronics or by serving as input to another piece of software the term was coined to contrast to the old term hardware meaning physical devices in contrast to hardware software cannot be touched 1 software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense meaning application software only sometimes the term includes data that has not traditionally been associated with computers such as film tapes and records 2 computer software is so called to distinguish it from computer hardware which encompasses the physical interconnections and devices required to store and execute or run the software at the lowest level executable code consists of machine language instructions specific to an individual processor a machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state programs are an ordered sequence of instructions for changing the state of the computer in a particular sequence it is usually written in high level programming languages that are easier and more efficient for humans to use closer to natural language than machine language high level languages are compiled or interpreted into machine language object code software may also be written in an assembly language essentially a mnemonic representation of a machine language using a natural language alphabet assembly language must be assembled into object code via an assembler contents 1 history 2 types of software 2 1 system software 2 2 programming software 2 3 application

wikipedia s quality standards you can help the discussion page may contain suggestions january 2012 the first theory about software was proposed by alan turing in his 1935 essay computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem decision problem 3 colloquially the term is often used to mean application software in computer science and software engineering software is all information processed by computer system programs and data the academic fields studying software are computer science and software engineering as more and more programs enter the realm of firmware and the hardware itself becomes smaller cheaper and faster as predicted by moore s law elements of computing first considered to be software join the ranks of hardware most hardware companies today have more software programmers on the payroll than hardware designers citation needed since software tools have automated many tasks of printed circuit board engineers just like the auto industry the software industry has grown from a few visionaries operating out of their garage with prototypes steve jobs and bill gates were the henry ford and louis chevrolet of their times citation needed who capitalized on ideas already commonly known before they started in the business in the case of software development this moment is generally agreed to be the publication in the 1980s of the specifications for the ibm personal computer published by ibm employee philip don estridge today his move would be seen as a type of crowd sourcing computer hardware companies not only bundled their software they also placed demands on the location of the hardware in a refrigerated space called a computer room until that time software was bundled with the hardware by original equipment manufacturers oems such as data general digital equipment and ibm citation needed when a customer bought a minicomputer at that time the smallest computer on the market the computer did not come with pre installed software but needed to be installed by engineers employed by the oem computer hardware companies not only bundled their software they also placed demands on the location of the hardware in a refrigerated space called a computer room most companies had their software on the books for 0 dollars unable to claim it as an asset this is similar to financing of popular music in those days when data general introduced the data general nova a company called digidyne wanted to use its rdos operating system on its own hardware clone data general refused to license their software which was hard to do since it was on the books as a free asset and claimed their bundling rights the supreme court set a precedent called digidyne v data general in 1985 the supreme court let a 9th circuit decision stand and data general was eventually forced into licensing the operating system software because it was ruled that restricting the license to only dg hardware was an illegal tying arrangement 4 unable to sustain the loss from lawyer s fees data general ended up being taken over by emc corporation the supreme court decision made it possible to value software and also purchase software patents there are many successful companies today that sell only software products though there are still many common software licensing problems due to the complexity of designs and poor documentation leading to patent trolls with open software specifications and the possibility of software licensing new opportunities arose for software tools that then became the de facto standard such as dos for operating systems but also various proprietary word processing and spreadsheet programs in a similar growth pattern proprietary development methods became standard software development methodology edit types of software a layer structure showing where the operating system software and application software are situated while running on a typical desktop computer software includes all the various forms and roles that digitally stored data may have and play in a computer or similar system regardless of whether the data is used as code for a cpu or other interpreter or whether it represents other kinds of information software thus encompasses a wide array of products that may be developed using different techniques such as ordinary programming languages scripting languages microcode or an fpga configuration the types of software include web pages developed in languages and frameworks like html php perl jsp asp net xml and desktop applications like openoffice org microsoft word developed in languages like 160 c c objective c java c or smalltalk application software usually runs on an underlying software operating systems such as linux or microsoft windows software or firmware is also used in video games and for the configurable parts of the logic systems of automobiles televisions and other consumer electronics practical computer systems divide software systems into three major classes citation needed system software programming software and application software although the distinction is arbitrary and often blurred edit system software main article system software system software is computer software designed to operate the computer hardware to provide basic functionality and to provide a platform for running application software 5 system software includes device drivers operating systems servers utilities and window systems system software is responsible for managing a variety of independent hardware components so that they can work together harmoniously its purpose is to unburden the application software programmer from the often complex details of the particular computer being used including such accessories as communications devices printers device readers displays and keyboards and also to partition the computer s resources such as memory and processor time in a safe and stable manner edit programming software main article programming tool programming software include tools in the form of programs or applications that software developers use to create debug maintain or otherwise support other programs and applications the term usually refers to relatively simple programs such as compilers debuggers interpreters linkers and text editors that can be combined together to accomplish a task much as one might use multiple hand tools to fix a physical object programming tools are intended to assist a programmer in writing computer programs and they may be combined in an integrated development environment ide to more easily manage all of these functions edit application software main article application software application software is developed to perform in any task that benefits from computation it is a set of programs that allows the computer to perform a specific data processing job for the user it is a broad category and encompasses software of many kinds including the internet browser being used to display this page edit software topics edit architecture see also software architecture users often see things differently than programmers people who use modern general purpose computers as opposed to embedded systems analog computers and supercomputers usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks platform application and user software platform software platform includes the firmware device drivers an operating system and typically a graphical user interface which in total allow a user to interact with the computer and its peripherals associated equipment platform software often comes bundled with the computer on a pc you will usually have the ability to change the platform software application software application software or applications are what most people think of when they think of software typical examples include office suites and video games application software is often purchased separately from computer hardware sometimes applications are bundled with the computer but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications applications are usually independent programs from the operating system though they are often tailored for specific platforms most users think of compilers databases and other system software as applications user written software end user development tailors systems to meet users specific needs user software include spreadsheet templates and word processor templates even email filters are a kind of user software users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is depending on how competently the user written software has been integrated into default application packages many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages and what has been added by co workers edit documentation main article software documentation most software has software documentation so that the end user can understand the program what it does and how to use it without clear documentation software can be hard to use especially if it is very specialized and relatively complex like photoshop or autocad developer documentation may also exist either with the code as comments and or as separate files detailing how the programs works and can be modified edit library main article software library an executable is almost always not sufficiently complete for direct execution software libraries include collections of functions and functionality that may be embedded in other applications operating systems include many standard software libraries and applications are often distributed with their own libraries edit standard main article software standard since software can be designed using many different programming languages and in many different operating systems and operating environments software standard is needed so that different software can understand and exchange information between each other for instance an email sent from a microsoft outlook should be readable from yahoo mail and vice versa edit execution main article execution computing computer software has to be loaded into the computer s storage such as the hard drive or memory once the software has loaded the computer is able to execute the software this involves passing instructions from the application software through the system software to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as machine code each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation 160 moving data carrying out a computation or altering the control flow of instructions data movement is typically from one place in memory to another sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high speed data access in the cpu moving data especially large amounts of it can be costly so this is sometimes avoided by using pointers to data instead computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element more complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together edit quality and reliability main articles software quality software testing and software reliability software quality is very important especially for commercial and system software like microsoft office microsoft windows and linux if software is faulty buggy it can delete a person s work crash the computer and do other unexpected things faults and errors are called bugs many bugs are discovered and eliminated debugged through software testing however software testing rarely 160 if ever 160 eliminates every bug some programmers say that every program has at least one more bug lubarsky s law all major software companies such as microsoft novell and sun microsystems have their own software testing departments with the specific goal of just testing software can be tested through unit testing regression testing and other methods which are done manually or most commonly automatically since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large for instance nasa has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions many nasa based operations interact and identify each other through command programs called software this enables many people who work at nasa to check and evaluate functional systems overall programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together edit license main article software license the software s license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment some software comes with the license when purchased off the shelf or an oem license when bundled with hardware other software comes with a free software license granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software software can also be in the form of freeware or shareware edit patents main articles software patent and software patent debate software can be patented in some but not all countries however software patents can be controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about it the controversy over software patents is about specific algorithms or techniques that the software contains which may not be duplicated by others and considered intellectual property and copyright infringement depending on the severity edit design and implementation a particular implementation of software this software was created to assist the wikipedia website also it does not use a graphical user interface aside from a simple console window main articles software development computer programming and software engineering design and implementation of software varies depending on the complexity of the software for instance design and creation of microsoft word software will take much more time than designing and developing microsoft notepad because of the difference in functionalities in each one software is usually designed and created coded written programmed in integrated development environments ide like eclipse emacs and microsoft visual studio that can simplify the process and compile the program as noted in different section software is usually created on top of existing software and the application programming interface api that the underlying software provides like gtk javabeans or swing libraries apis are categorized for different purposes for instance javabeans library is used for designing enterprise applications windows forms library is used for designing graphical user interface gui applications like microsoft word and windows communication foundation is used for designing web services underlying computer programming concepts like quicksort hash table array and binary tree can be useful to creating software when a program is designed it relies on the api for instance if a user is designing a microsoft windows desktop application he she might use the net windows forms library to design the desktop application and call its apis like form1 close and form1 show 6 to close or open the application and write the additional operations him herself that it need to have without these apis the programmer needs to write these apis him herself companies like sun microsystems novell and microsoft provide their own apis so that many applications are written using their software libraries that usually have numerous apis in them computer software has special economic characteristics that make its design creation and distribution different from most other economic goods specify 7 8 a person who creates software is called a programmer software engineer software developer or code monkey terms that all have a similar meaning edit industry and organizations main article software industry a great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry software can be quite a profitable industry bill gates the founder of microsoft was the richest person in the world in 2009 largely by selling the microsoft windows and microsoft office software products the same goes for larry ellison largely through his oracle database software through time the software industry has become increasingly specialized non profit software organizations include the free software foundation gnu project and mozilla foundation software standard organizations like the w3c ietf develop software standards so that most software can interoperate through standards such as xml html http or ftp other well known large software companies include novell sap symantec adobe systems and corel while small companies often provide innovation edit see also software portal free software
