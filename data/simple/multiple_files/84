churn rate sometimes called attrition rate in its broadest sense is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective over a specific period of time it is one of two primary factors that determine the steady state level of customers a business will support the term is used in many contexts but is most widely applied in business with respect to a contractual customer base for instance it is an important factor for any business with a subscriber based service model including mobile telephone networks and pay tv operators the term is also used to refer to participant turnover in peer to peer networks the phrase is based on the english verb churn meaning to agitate or produce violent motion contents 1 definition 1 1 customer base 1 2 employee turnover 1 3 employee moves attrition rate 2 see also 3 references edit definition edit customer base churn rate when applied to a customer base refers to the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers who leave a supplier during a given time period it is a possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction cheaper and or better offers from the competition more successful sales and or marketing by the competition or reasons having to do with the customer life cycle the churn rate can be minimized by creating barriers which discourage customers to change suppliers contractual binding periods use of proprietary technology value added services unique business models etc or through retention activities such as loyalty programs it is possible to overstate the churn rate as when a consumer drops the service but then restarts it within the same year thus a clear distinction needs to be made between gross churn the total number of absolute disconnections and net churn the overall loss of subscribers or members the difference between the two measures is the number of new subscribers or members that have joined during the same period suppliers may find that if they offer a loss leader introductory special it can lead to a higher churn rate and subscriber abuse as some subscribers will sign on let the service lapse then sign on again to take continuous advantage of current specials edit employee turnover in some business contexts churn rate could also refer to high employee turnover within a company for instance most fast food restaurants have a routinely high churn rate among employees for larger companies such as fortune 500 companies the attrition rate tends to be much lower compared to a fast food franchise the company size and industry also play a key role in attrition rate an acceptable attrition rate for a given company is relative to its industry it would not likely be useful to compare the attrition of fast food employees with a fortune 500 company in a corporate setting regardless of industry or company size attrition rate tends to be highest among the lowest paying jobs and lowest for the highest paying jobs citation needed attrition rate has always played a role in how cash flow is affected for employee payroll citation needed for example if a company has 10 000 employees and needs to save money on payroll it may be wise to simply institute a temporary hiring freeze knowing that some people will leave the company through natural attrition thus saving employee payroll by not replacing or hiring new employees it could be expected that if the average employee makes 40 000 per year and the company has 10 000 employees a natural attrition rate could be between 1 and 5 depending on the size and industry of the company according to whom a rate of 5 or more for a larger company most often indicates layoffs in addition to natural attrition early retirement and firing according to whom edit employee moves attrition rate churn rate can also describe the number of employees that move within a certain period for example the annual churn rate would be the total number of moves completed in a 12 month period divided by the average number of occupants during the same 12 month period monthly and quarterly churn rates can also be calculated formula attrition rate number of employees resigned for the month total number of employees at the start of the month number of employees joined for that month number of employees resigned x 100 edit see also customer attrition edit references berry and linoff michael j a and gordon s 2000 mastering data mining the art and science of customer relationship management john wiley amp sons isbn 160 0 471 33123 6 insight paper on churn in the mobile communications industry click on the link under market studies on the right side
