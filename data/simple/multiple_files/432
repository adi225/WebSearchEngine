ritornello and monteverdi s l orfeo 1607 opens with a toccata in this case a fanfare for muted trumpets more important however was the prologue which comprised sung dialogue between allegorical characters which introduced the overarching themes of the stories depicted edit french overture as a musical form however the so called french overture begins with the court ballet and operatic overtures of jean baptiste lully 3 which he elaborated from a similar two section form called ouverture found in the french ballets de cour as early as 1640 4 this french overture consists of a slow introduction in a marked dotted rhythm i e exaggerated iambic if the first chord is disregarded followed by a lively movement in fugato style the overture was frequently followed by a series of dance tunes before the curtain rose and would often return following the prologue to introduce the action proper this ouverture style was also used in english opera most notably in henry purcell s dido and neas its distinctive rhythmic profile and function thus led to the french overture style as found in the works of late baroque composers such as johann sebastian bach the style is most often used in preludes to suites and can be found in non staged vocal works such as cantatas for example in the opening chorus of bach s cantata nun komm der heiden heiland bwv 61 edit italian overture in italy a distinct form called overture arose in the 1680s and became established particularly through the operas of alessandro scarlatti and spread throughout europe supplanting the french form as the standard operatic overture by the mid 18th century 5 its usual form is in three generally homophonic movements fast slow fast the opening movement was normally in duple metre and in a major key the slow movement in earlier examples was usually quite short and could be in a contrasting key the concluding movement was dance like most often with rhythms of the gigue or minuet and returned to the key of the opening section as the form evolved the first movement often incorporated fanfare like elements and took on the pattern of so called sonatina form sonata form without a development section and the slow section became more extended and lyrical 6 italian overtures were often detached from their operas and played as independent concert pieces in this context they became important in the early history of the symphony 7 edit 18th century and sonata form with the increasing popularity of the italian opera and the sonata form the french ouverture fell out of fashion gluck whose remarks on the function of overtures in the preface to alceste are historic based himself on italian models of loose texture by the time of wolfgang amadeus mozart s later works the overture in the sonata style had clearly differentiated itself from strictly symphonic music instances of this substitution are mozart s symphony no 32 in g which is an overture to an unknown opera and his overtures to die entf hrung aus dem serail and to lo sposo deluso in both of which cases the curtain rises at a point which throws a remarkable dramatic light upon the peculiar form mozart s last overture the magic flute 1791 seemed to point toward the 19th century rossinian model with its grand opening and slow heavy introduction leading to a lighthearted main theme in beethoven s hands the overture style and form increased its distinction from that of the symphony citation needed edit 19th century and william tell although gioachino rossini retired from writing overtures after william tell in 1829 19th century overtures largely owe their focus to forms he had developed and perfected long before primarily for italian opera buffa citation needed rossini s first professional operatic overture la cambiale di matrimonio 1810 bypassed strict sonata form employing a grand opening a slow introduction first main theme an extended bridge to a second main theme crescendo then a closing section original research attempts at this style can be clearly heard in overtures of adolphe adam carl maria von weber giuseppe verdi hector berlioz and others though none having achieved rossini s reputation as craftsmen of overtures as the simple transparent style requires a preponderance of inspired melodic ideas for lasting effect citation needed however william tell may have more successfully served as the model for the 19th century romantic overture with its revolutionary four part form achieving the grand effect of a mini symphony expanding the boundaries for 19th century opera as a whole the william tell overture signalled the close of the classical period for the operatic stage at its premiere paving the way for giacomo meyerbeer and richard wagner its influence being heard as far forward as tchaikovsky s 1812 overture and offenbach s orpheus in the underworld citation needed edit modern opera in modern opera vague the overture vorspiel einleitung introduction or whatever else it may be called is generally nothing more definite than that portion of the music which takes place before the curtain rises richard wagner s vorspiel to lohengrin is a short self contained movement founded on the music of the grail edit operettas and musicals many 19th century operettas and light operas substituted for the specially composed overture in strict overture form as detailed above a potpourri of airs based on the tunes of the songs that were to follow sullivan for instance seldom actually wrote out his own overtures since they followed the potpourri format expected from an english comic opera of the time any competent orchestrator could be trusted with this task citation needed twentieth century and contemporary overtures accompanying broadway and other musical theatre almost always follow this pattern consisting of segments from the more popular songs in the musical gypsy 1959 and candide 1956 are considered masterpieces of their genre by many musical theatre scholars and working professionals weasel 160 words the overture usually is played before the musical starts however some musicals such as passion lachiusa s the wild party sunday in the park with george and rent dispense with a formal overture altogether a unique example is the recent revival of cole porter s kiss me kate wherein the overture appears between the opening and closing choruses of the show s opening number another op ning another show with the company remaining on stage acting in pantomime however in the original 1948 production and all other productions of the show up to 1999 the overture to the show appeared in its usual place before the first song likewise musicals such as a little night music nine and company begin with vocal overtures the overture to the kurt weill bertolt brecht musical the threepenny opera 1928 is written in the neoclassical style and like neo classical and pre 19th overtures is an entirely original melody that is not heard anywhere else in the score original research edit concert overture edit early 19th century although by the end of the eighteenth century opera overtures were already beginning to be performed as separate items in the concert hall the concert overture intended specifically as an individual concert piece without reference to stage performance and generally based on some literary theme began to appear early in the romantic era carl maria von weber wrote two concert overtures der beherrscher der geister the ruler of the spirits 1811 a revision of the overture to his unfinished opera r bezahl of 1805 and jubel ouvert re jubilee overture 1818 incorporating god save the king at its climax however the overture a midsummer night s dream 1826 by felix mendelssohn is generally regarded as the first concert overture temperley 2001 mendelssohn s other contributions to this genre include his calm sea and prosperous voyage overture 1828 his fingal s cave overture also known as the hebrides overture 1830 and the overtures die sch ne melusine the fair melusine 1834 and ruy blas 1839 other notable early concert overtures were written by hector berlioz e g les francs juges 1826 and le corsaire 1828 robert schumann wrote overtures based on literature written by friedrich schiller william shakespeare and johann wolfgang von goethe such as the overtures to the bride of messina julius caesar and hermann und dorothea although these overtures derive their musical inspiration from literary works schumann neither composed music for the entire work as he would for an opera nor necessarily intended a spoken performance to immediately follow both schumann and tchaikovsky would in fact incorporate bits of the french national anthem la marseillaise into their overtures hermann und dorothea and 1812 respectively which indicates the independent nature of this type of overture citation needed edit later 19th century in the 1850s the concert overture began to be supplanted by the symphonic poem a form devised by franz liszt in several works that began as dramatic overtures the distinction between the two genres was the freedom to mould the musical form according to external programmatic requirements temperley 2001 the symphonic poem became the preferred form for the more progressive composers such as c sar franck richard strauss alexander scriabin and arnold schoenberg while more conservative composers like anton rubinstein tchaikovsky johannes brahms and arthur sullivan remained faithful to the overture 8 in the age when the symphonic poem had already become popular brahms wrote his academic festival overture op 80 as well as his tragic overture op 81 an example clearly influenced by the symphonic poem is tchaikovsky s 1812 overture his equally well known romeo and juliet is also labelled a fantasy overture edit 20th century in european music after 1900 the traditional overture was scarcely relevant any longer though the name continued in use as one of a number of alternatives for describing an orchestral piece often written for a festive occasion in one movement of moderate length a notable late exception displaying a connection with the traditional form is dmitri shostakovich s festive overture op 96 1954 which is in two linked sections allegretto and presto temperely 2001 film composer mikl s r zsa s overture to a symphony concert op 26a 1963 is also worth mentioning citation
