in statistics latent dirichlet allocation lda is a generative model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar for example if observations are words collected into documents it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word s creation is attributable to one of the document s topics lda is an example of a topic model and was first presented as a graphical model for topic discovery by david blei andrew ng and michael jordan in 2003 1 contents 1 topics in lda 2 model 2 1 mathematical definition 3 inference 4 applications extensions and similar techniques 5 see also 6 notes 7 external links edit topics in lda in lda each document may be viewed as a mixture of various topics this is similar to probabilistic latent semantic analysis plsa except that in lda the topic distribution is assumed to have a dirichlet prior in practice this results in more reasonable mixtures of topics in a document it has been noted however that the plsa model is equivalent to the lda model under a uniform dirichlet prior distribution 2 for example an lda model might have topics that can be classified as cat related and dog related a topic has probabilities of generating various words such as milk meow and kitten which can be classified and interpreted by the viewer as cat related naturally the word cat itself will have high probability given this topic the dog related topic likewise has probabilities of generating each word puppy bark and bone might have high probability words without special relevance such as the see function word will have roughly even probability between classes or can be placed into a separate category a topic is not strongly defined neither semantically nor epistemologically it is identified on the basis of supervised labeling and manual pruning on the basis of their likelihood of co occurrence a lexical word may occur in several topics with a different probability however with a different typical set of neighboring words in each topic each document is assumed to be characterized by a particular set of topics this is akin to the standard bag of words model assumption and makes the individual words exchangeable edit model plate notation representing the lda model with plate notation the dependencies among the many variables can be captured concisely the boxes are plates representing replicates the outer plate represents documents while the inner plate represents the repeated choice of topics and words within a document m denotes the number of documents n the number of words in a document thus is the parameter of the dirichlet prior on the per document topic distributions is the parameter of the dirichlet prior on the per topic word distribution is the topic distribution for document i is the word distribution for topic k is the topic for the j th word in document i and is the specific word plate notation for smoothed lda the are the only observable variables and the other variables are latent variables mostly the basic lda model will be extended to a smoothed version to gain better results the plate notation is shown on the right where k denotes the number of topics considered in the model and is a k v v is the dimension of the vocabulary markov matrix each row of which denotes the word distribution of a topic the generative process behind is that documents are represented as random mixtures over latent topics where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words lda assumes the following generative process for each document in a corpus d 160 1 choose where and is the dirichlet distribution for parameter 2 choose where 3 for each of the words where a choose a topic b choose a word note that the multinomial distribution here refers to the multinomial with only one trial it is formally equivalent to the categorical distribution the lengths are treated as independent of all the other data generating variables and the subscript is often dropped as in the plate diagrams shown here edit mathematical definition a formal description of smoothed lda is as follows definition of variables in the model variable type meaning integer number of topics e g 50 integer number of words in the vocabulary e g 50 000 or 1 000 000 integer number of documents integer number of words in document d integer total number of words in all documents sum of all values i e positive real prior weight of topic k in a document usually the same for all topics normally a number less than 1 e g 0 1 to prefer sparse topic distributions i e few topics per document k dimension vector of positive reals collection of all values viewed as a single vector positive real prior weight of word w in a topic usually the same for all words normally a number much less than 1 e g 0 001 to strongly prefer sparse word distributions i e few words per topic v dimension vector of positive reals collection of all values viewed as a single vector probability real number between 0 and 1 probability of word w occurring in topic k v dimension vector of probabilities which must sum to 1 distribution of words in topic k probability real number between 0 and 1 probability of topic k occurring in document d for a given word k dimension vector of probabilities which must sum to 1 distribution of topics in document d integer between 1 and k identity of topic of word w in document d n dimension vector of integers between 1 and k identity of topic of all words in all documents integer between 1 and v identity of word w in document d n dimension vector of integers between 1 and v identity of all words in all documents we can then mathematically describe the random variables as follows edit inference see also dirichlet multinomial distribution learning the various distributions the set of topics their associated word probabilities the topic of each word and the particular topic mixture of each document is a problem of bayesian inference the original paper used a variational bayes approximation of the posterior distribution 1 alternative inference techniques use gibbs sampling 3 and expectation propagation 4 following is the derivation of the equations for collapsed gibbs sampling which means s and s will be integrated out for simplicity in this derivation the documents are all assumed to have the same length the derivation is equally valid if the document lengths vary according to the model the total probability of the model is where the bold font variables denote the vector version of the variables first of all and need to be integrated out note that all the s are independent to each other and the same to all the s so we can treat each and each separately we now focus only on the part we can further focus on only one as the following actually it is the hidden part of the model for the document now we replace the probabilities in the above equation by the true distribution expression to write out the explicit equation let be the number of word tokens in the document with the same word symbol the word in the vocabulary assigned to the topic so is three dimensional if any of the three dimensions is not limited to a specific value we use a parenthesized point to denote for example denotes the number of word tokens in the document assigned to the topic thus the right most part of the above equation can be rewritten as so the integration formula can be changed to clearly the equation inside the integration has the same form as the dirichlet distribution according to the dirichlet distribution thus now we turn our attentions to the part actually the derivation of the part is very similar to the part here we only list the steps of the derivation for clarity here we write down the final equation with both and integrated out the goal of gibbs sampling here is to approximate the distribution of since is invariable for any of z gibbs sampling equations can be derived from directly the key point is to derive the following conditional probability where denotes the hidden variable of the word token in the document and further we assume that the word symbol of it is the word in the vocabulary denotes all the s but note that gibbs sampling needs only to sample a value for according to the above probability we do not need the exact value of but the ratios among the probabilities that can take value so the above equation can be simplified as finally let be the same meaning as but with the excluded the above equation can be further simplified by treating terms not dependent on as constants note that the same formula is derived in the article on the dirichlet multinomial distribution as part of a more general discussion of integrating dirichlet distribution priors out of a bayesian network edit applications extensions and similar techniques topic modeling is a classic problem in information retrieval related models and techniques are among others latent semantic indexing independent component analysis probabilistic latent semantic indexing non negative matrix factorization and gamma poisson the lda model is highly modular and can therefore be easily extended the main field of interest is modeling relations between topics this is achieved by using another distribution on the simplex instead of the dirichlet the correlated topic model 5 follows this approach inducing a correlation structure between topics by using the logistic normal distribution instead of the dirichlet another extension is the hierarchical lda hlda 6 where topics are joined together in a hierarchy by using the nested chinese restaurant process lda can also be extended to a corpus in which a document includes two types of information e g words and names as in the lda dual model 7 supervised versions of lda include l lda which has been found to perform better than svm under certain conditions 8 nonparametric extensions of lda include the hierarchical dirichlet process mixture model which allows the number of topics to be unbounded and learnt from data and the nested chinese restaurant process which allows topics to be arranged in a hierarchy whose structure is learnt from data as noted earlier plsa is similar to lda the lda model is essentially the bayesian version of plsa model the bayesian formulation tends to perform better on small datasets because bayesian methods can avoid overfitting the data in a very large dataset the results are probably the same one difference is that plsa uses a variable to represent a document in the training set so in plsa when presented with a document the model hasn t seen before we fix the probability of words under topics to be that learned from the training set and use the same em algorithm to infer the topic distribution under blei argues that this step is cheating because you are essentially refitting the model to the new data variations on lda have been used to automatically put natural images into categories such as bedroom or forest by treating an image as a document and small patches of the image as words 9 one of the variations is called spatial latent dirichlet allocation 10 edit see also pachinko allocation tf idf edit notes a b blei david m ng andrew y jordan michael i january 2003 lafferty john ed latent
