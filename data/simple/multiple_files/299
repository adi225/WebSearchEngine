the energy needed by an electron to make it a conduction electron so it can move freely materials with a wide band gap have very few conduction electrons making them insulators 3 core copper wire power cable each core with individual colour coded insulating sheaths all contained within an outer protective sheath pvc sheathed mineral insulated copper cable with 2 conducting cores an electrical insulator is a material whose internal electric charges do not flow freely and which therefore does not conduct an electric current under the influence of an electric field a perfect insulator does not exist but some materials such as glass paper and teflon which have high resistivity are very good electrical insulators a much larger class of materials even though they may have lower bulk resistivity are still good enough to insulate electrical wiring and cables examples include rubber like polymers and most plastics such materials can serve as practical and safe insulators for low to moderate voltages hundreds or even thousands of volts insulators are used in electrical equipment to support and separate electrical conductors without allowing current through themselves an insulating material used in bulk to wrap electrical cables or other equipment is called insulation the term insulator is also used more specifically to refer to insulating supports used to attach electric power distribution or transmission lines to utility poles and transmission towers contents 1 physics of conduction in solids 1 1 breakdown 2 uses 3 telegraph and power transmission insulators

external links edit physics of conduction in solids electrical insulation is the absence of electrical conduction electronic band theory a branch of physics says that a charge will flow if states are available into which electrons can be excited this allows electrons to gain energy and thereby move through a conductor such as a metal if no such states are available the material is an insulator most though not all see mott insulator insulators have a large band gap this occurs because the valence band containing the highest energy electrons is full and a large energy gap separates this band from the next band above it there is always some voltage called the breakdown voltage that will give the electrons enough energy to be excited into this band once this voltage is exceeded the material ceases being an insulator and charge will begin to pass through it however it is usually accompanied by physical or chemical changes that permanently degrade the material s insulating properties materials that lack electron conduction are insulators if they lack other mobile charges as well for example if a liquid or gas contains ions then the ions can be made to flow as an electric current and the material is a conductor electrolytes and plasmas contain ions and will act as conductors whether or not electron flow is involved edit breakdown when subjected to a high enough voltage insulators suffer from the phenomenon of electrical breakdown when the electric field applied across an insulating substance exceeds in any location the threshold breakdown field for that substance the insulator suddenly becomes a conductor causing a large increase in current an electric arc through the substance electrical breakdown occurs when the electric field in the material is strong enough to accelerate free charge carriers electrons and ions which are always present at low concentrations to a high enough velocity to knock electrons from atoms when they strike them ionizing the atoms these freed electrons and ions are in turn accelerated and strike other atoms creating more charge carriers in a chain reaction rapidly the insulator becomes filled with mobile charge carriers and its resistance drops to a low level in a solid the breakdown voltage is proportional to the band gap energy the air in a region around a high voltage conductor can break down and ionise without a catastrophic increase in current this is called corona discharge however if the region of air breakdown extends to another conductor at a different voltage it will create a conductive path between them and a large current will flow through the air creating an electric arc even a vacuum can suffer a sort of breakdown but in this case the breakdown or vacuum arc involves charges ejected from the surface of metal electrodes rather than produced by the vacuum itself edit uses insulators are commonly used as a flexible coating on electric wire and cable since air is an insulator in principle no other substance is needed to keep power where it should be high voltage power lines commonly use just air since a solid e g plastic coating is impractical however wires which touch each other will produce cross connections short circuits and fire hazards in coaxial cable the center conductor must be supported exactly in the middle of the hollow shield in order to prevent em wave reflections finally wires which expose voltages higher than 60v can cause human shock and electrocution hazards insulating coatings help to prevent all of these problems some wires have a mechanical covering which has no voltage rating citation needed e g service drop welding doorbell thermostat an insulated wire or cable has a voltage rating and a maximum conductor temperature rating it may not have an ampacity current carrying capacity rating since this is dependent upon the surrounding environment e g ambient temperature in electronic systems printed circuit boards are made from epoxy plastic and fibreglass the nonconductive boards support layers of copper foil conductors in electronic devices the tiny and delicate active components are embedded within nonconductive epoxy or phenolic plastics or within baked glass or ceramic coatings in microelectronic components such as transistors and ics the silicon material is normally a conductor because of doping but it can easily be selectively transformed into a good insulator by the application of heat and oxygen oxidised silicon is quartz i e silicon dioxide the primary component of glass in high voltage systems containing transformers and capacitors liquid insulator oil is the typical method used for preventing arcs the oil replaces the air in any spaces which must support significant voltage without electrical breakdown other methods of insulating high voltage systems are ceramic or glass wire holders gas vacuum and simply placing the wires with a large separation using the air as insulation edit telegraph and power transmission insulators power lines with ceramic insulators in california usa suspended wires for electric power transmission are bare except where they enter buildings and are insulated by the surrounding air insulating supports called insulators are required at the points at which they are supported by utility poles or transmission towers insulators are also required where the wire enters buildings or electrical devices such as transformers or circuit breakers to insulate the wire from the case these hollow insulators with a conductor inside them are called bushings 10 kv ceramic insulator showing sheds edit material insulators used for high voltage power transmission are made from glass porcelain or composite polymer materials porcelain insulators are made from clay quartz or alumina and feldspar and are covered with a smooth glaze to shed water insulators made from porcelain rich in alumina are used where high mechanical strength is a criterion porcelain has a dielectric strength of about 4 10 kv mm 1 glass has a higher dielectric strength but it attracts condensation and the thick irregular shapes needed for insulators are difficult to cast without internal strains 2 some insulator manufacturers stopped making glass insulators in the late 1960s switching to ceramic materials recently some electric utilities have begun converting to polymer composite materials for some types of insulators these are typically composed of a central rod made of fibre reinforced plastic and an outer weathershed made of silicone rubber or ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber epdm composite insulators are less costly lighter in weight and have excellent hydrophobic capability this combination makes them ideal for service in polluted areas however these materials do not yet have the long term proven service life of glass and porcelain edit design high voltage ceramic bushing during manufacture before glazing the electrical breakdown of an insulator due to excessive voltage can occur in one of two ways puncture voltage is the voltage across the insulator when installed in its normal manner which causes a breakdown and conduction of the material of the insulator causing a puncture arc through the interior of the insulator the heat resulting from the puncture arc usually damages the insulator irreparably flashover voltage is the voltage which causes the air around or along the surface of the insulator to break down and conduct causing a flashover arc along the outside of the insulator they are usually designed to withstand this without damage most high voltage insulators are designed with a lower flashover voltage than puncture voltage so they will flash over before they puncture to avoid damage dirt pollution salt and particularly water on the surface of a high voltage insulator can create a conductive path across it causing leakage currents and flashovers the flashover voltage can be more than 50 lower when the insulator is wet high voltage insulators for outdoor use are shaped to maximise the length of the leakage path along the surface from one end to the other called the creepage length to minimise these leakage currents 3 to accomplish this the surface is moulded into a series of corrugations or concentric disc shapes these usually include one or more sheds downward facing cup shaped surfaces that act as umbrellas to ensure that the part of the surface leakage path under the cup stays dry in wet weather minimum creepage distances are 20 25 160 mm kv but must be increased in high pollution or airborne sea salt areas cap and pin insulator string the vertical string of discs on a 275 kv suspension pylon suspended glass disc insulator unit used in cap and pin insulator strings for high voltage transmission lines ceramic insulators on a power line in poland edit cap and pin insulators higher voltage transmission lines usually use modular cap and pin insulator designs see picture above the wires are suspended from a string of identical disc shaped insulators which attach to each other with metal clevis pin or ball and socket links the advantage of this design is that insulator strings with different breakdown voltages for use with different line voltages can be constructed by using different numbers of the basic units also if one of the insulator units in the string breaks it can be replaced without discarding the entire string each unit is constructed of a ceramic or glass disc with a metal cap and pin cemented to opposite sides in order to make defective units obvious glass units are designed with class b clarification needed construction so that an overvoltage causes a puncture arc through the glass instead of a flashover the glass is heat treated so it will shatter making the damaged unit visible however the mechanical strength of the unit is unchanged so the insulator string will stay together standard disc insulator units are 25 centimetres 9 8 160 in in diameter and 15 160 cm 6 160 in long can support a load of 80 120 k n 18 27 k lbf have a dry flashover voltage of about 72 kv and are rated at an operating voltage of 10 12 kv 4 however the flashover voltage of a string is less than the sum of its component discs because the electric field is not distributed evenly across the string but is strongest at the disc nearest to the conductor which will flash over first metal grading rings are sometimes added around the disc at the high voltage end to reduce the electric field across that disc and improve flashover voltage in very high voltage lines the insulator may be surrounded by corona rings 5 these typically consist of toruses of aluminum most commonly or copper tubing attached to the line they are designed to reduce the electric field at the point where the insulator is attached to the line to prevent corona discharge which results in power losses typical number of disc insulator units for standard line voltages 6 line voltage kv discs 34 5 3 46 4 69 5 92 7 115 8 138

make use of insulators were telegraph lines direct attachment of wires to wooden poles was found to give very poor results especially during damp weather the first glass insulators used in large quantities had an unthreaded pinhole these pieces of glass were positioned on a tapered wooden pin vertically extending upwards from the pole s crossarm commonly only two insulators to a pole and maybe one on top of the pole itself natural contraction and expansion of the wires tied to these threadless insulators resulted in insulators unseating from their pins requiring manual reseating amongst the first to produce ceramic insulators were companies in the united kingdom with stiff and doulton using stoneware from the mid 1840s joseph bourne later renamed denby producing them from around 1860 and bullers from 1868 utility patent number 48 906 was granted to louis a cauvet on july 25 1865 for a process to produce insulators with a threaded pinhole to this day pin type insulators still have threaded pinholes the invention of suspension type insulators made high voltage power transmission possible pin type insulators were unsatisfactory over about 60 000 volts citation needed a large variety of telephone telegraph and power insulators have been made some people collect them both for their historic interest and for the aesthetic quality of many insulator designs and finishes edit insulation of antennas egg shaped strain insulator often a broadcasting radio antenna is built as a mast radiator which means that the entire mast structure is energised with high voltage and must be insulated from the ground steatite mountings are used they have to withstand not only the voltage of the mast radiator to ground which can reach values up to 400 kv at some antennas but also the weight of the mast construction and dynamic forces arcing horns and lightning arresters are necessary because lightning strikes to the mast are common guy wires supporting antenna masts usually have strain insulators inserted in the cable run to keep the high voltages on the antenna from short circuiting to ground or creating a shock hazard often guy cables have several insulators placed to break up the cable into lengths that are not submultiples of the transmitting wavelength to avoid unwanted electrical resonances in the guy these insulators are usually ceramic and cylindrical or egg shaped see picture this construction has the advantage that the ceramic is under compression rather than tension so it can withstand greater load and that if the insulator breaks the cable ends will still be linked these insulators also have to be equipped with overvoltage protection equipment for the dimensions of the guy insulation static charges on guys have to be considered at high masts these can be much higher than the voltage caused by the transmitter requiring guys divided by insulators in multiple sections on the highest masts in this case guys which are grounded at the anchor basements via a coil or if possible directly are the better choice feedlines attaching antennas to radio equipment particularly twin lead type often must be kept at a distance from metal structures the insulated supports used for this purpose are called standoff insulators edit insulation in electrical apparatus the most important insulation material is air a variety of solid liquid and gaseous insulators are also used in electrical apparatus in smaller transformers generators and electric motors insulation on the wire coils consists of up to four thin layers of polymer varnish film film insulated magnet wire permits a manufacturer to obtain the maximum number of turns within the available space windings that use thicker conductors are often wrapped with supplemental fiberglass insulating tape windings may also be impregnated with insulating varnishes to prevent electrical corona and reduce magnetically induced wire vibration large power transformer windings are still mostly insulated with paper wood varnish and mineral oil although these materials have been used for more than 100 years they still provide a good balance of economy and adequate performance busbars and circuit breakers in switchgear may be insulated with glass reinforced plastic insulation treated to have low flame spread and to prevent tracking of current across the material in older apparatus made up to the early 1970s boards made of compressed asbestos may be found while this is an adequate insulator at power frequencies handling or repairs to asbestos material will release dangerous fibers into the air and must be carried out with caution wire insulated with felted asbestos was used in high temperature and rugged applications from the 1920s wire of this type was sold by general electric under the trade name deltabeston 7 live front switchboards up to the early part of the 20th century were made of slate or marble some high voltage equipment is designed to operate within a high pressure insulating gas such as sulfur hexafluoride insulation materials that perform well at power and low frequencies may be unsatisfactory at radio frequency due to heating from excessive dielectric dissipation electrical wires may be insulated with polyethylene crosslinked polyethylene either through electron beam processing or chemical crosslinking pvc kapton rubber like polymers oil impregnated paper teflon silicone or modified ethylene tetrafluoroethylene etfe larger power cables may use compressed inorganic powder depending on the application flexible insulating materials such as pvc polyvinyl chloride are used to insulate the circuit and prevent human contact with a live wire one having voltage of 600 volts or less alternative materials are likely to become increasingly used due to eu safety and environmental legislation making pvc less economic edit class 1 and class 2 insulation main article appliance classes all portable or hand held electrical devices are insulated to protect their user from harmful shock class 1 insulation requires that the metal body and other exposed metal parts of the device is connected to earth via a grounding wire which is earthed at the main service panel but only basic insulation of the conductors is needed this equipment needs an extra pin on the power plug for the grounding connection class 2 insulation means that the device is double insulated this is used on some appliances such as electric shavers hair dryers and portable power tools double insulation requires that the devices have both basic and supplementary insulation each of which is sufficient to prevent electric shock all internal electrically energised components are totally enclosed within an insulated body that prevents any contact with live parts in the eu double insulated appliances all are marked with a symbol of two squares one inside the other edit see also electronics portal electrical conductivity electrical substation
