in data mining association rule learning is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases it is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using different measures of interestingness 1 based on the concept of strong rules rakesh agrawal et al 2 introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by point of sale pos systems in supermarkets for example the rule found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together he or she is likely to also buy hamburger meat such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as e g promotional pricing or product placements in addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including web usage mining intrusion detection and bioinformatics as opposed to sequence mining association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions contents 1 definition 2 useful

items and 5 transactions transaction id milk bread butter beer 1 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 5 0 1 0 0 following the original definition by agrawal et al 2 the problem of association rule mining is defined as let be a set of binary attributes called items let be a set of transactions called the database each transaction in has a unique transaction id and contains a subset of the items in a rule is defined as an implication of the form where and the sets of items for short itemsets and are called antecedent left hand side or lhs and consequent right hand side or rhs of the rule respectively to illustrate the concepts we use a small example from the supermarket domain the set of items is and a small database containing the items 1 codes presence and 0 absence of an item in a transaction is shown in the table to the right an example rule for the supermarket could be meaning that if butter and bread are bought customers also buy milk note this example is extremely small in practical applications a rule needs a support of several hundred transactions before it can be considered statistically significant and datasets often contain thousands or millions of transactions edit useful concepts to select interesting rules from the set of all possible rules constraints on various measures of significance and interest can be used the best known constraints are minimum thresholds on support and confidence the support of an itemset is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset in the example database the itemset has a support of since it occurs in 20 of all transactions 1 out of 5 transactions the confidence of a rule is defined for example the rule has a confidence of in the database which means that for 50 of the transactions containing milk and bread the rule is correct 50 of the times a customer buys milk and bread butter is bought as well be careful when reading the expression here supp x y means support for occurrences of transactions where x and y both appear not support for occurrences of transactions where either x or y appears the latter interpretation arising because set union is equivalent to logical disjunction the argument of is a set of preconditions and thus becomes more restrictive as it grows instead of more inclusive confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability the probability of finding the rhs of the rule in transactions under the condition that these transactions also contain the lhs 3 the lift of a rule is defined as or the ratio of the observed support to that expected if x and y were independent the rule has a lift of the conviction of a rule is defined as the rule has a conviction of and can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that x occurs without y that is to say the frequency that the rule makes an incorrect prediction if x and y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions in this example the conviction value of 1 2 shows that the rule would be incorrect 20 more often 1 2 times as often if the association between x and y was purely random chance edit process frequent itemset lattice where the color of the box indicates how many transactions contain the combination of items note that lower levels of the lattice can contain at most the minimum number of their parents items e g ac can have only at most items this is called the downward closure property 2 association rules are usually required to satisfy a user specified minimum support and a user specified minimum confidence at the same time association rule generation is usually split up into two separate steps first minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database second these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules while the second step is straightforward the first step needs more attention finding all frequent itemsets in a database is difficult since it involves searching all possible itemsets item combinations the set of possible itemsets is the power set over and has size excluding the empty set which is not a valid itemset although the size of the powerset grows exponentially in the number of items in efficient search is possible using the downward closure property of support 2 4 also called anti monotonicity 5 which guarantees that for a frequent itemset all its subsets are also frequent and thus for an infrequent itemset all its supersets must also be infrequent exploiting this property efficient algorithms e g apriori 6 and eclat 7 can find all frequent itemsets edit history the concept of association rules was popularised particularly due to the 1993 article of agrawal et al 2 which has acquired more than 6000 citations according to google scholar as of march 2008 and is thus one of the most cited papers in the data mining field however it is possible that what is now called association rules is similar to what appears in the 1966 paper 8 on guha a general data mining method developed by petr h jek et al 9 edit alternative measures of interestingness next to confidence also other measures of interestingness for rules were proposed some popular measures are all confidence 10 collective strength 11 conviction 12 leverage 13 lift originally called interest 14 a definition of these measures can be found here several more measures are presented and compared by tan et al 15 looking for techniques that can model what the user has known and using this models as interestingness measures is currently an active research trend under the name of subjective interestingness edit statistically sound associations one limitation of the standard approach to discovering associations is that by searching massive numbers of possible associations to look for collections of items that appear to be associated there is a large risk of finding many spurious associations these are collections of items that co occur with unexpected frequency in the data but only do so by chance for example suppose we are considering a collection of 10 000 items and looking for rules containing two items in the left hand side and 1 item in the right hand side there are approximately 1 000 000 000 000 such rules if we apply a statistical test for independence with a significance level of 0 05 it means there is only a 5 chance of accepting a rule if there is no association if we assume there are no associations we should nonetheless expect to find 50 000 000 000 rules statistically sound association discovery 16 17 controls this risk in most cases reducing the risk of finding any spurious associations to a user specified significance level edit algorithms many algorithms for generating association rules were presented over time some well known algorithms are apriori eclat and fp growth but they only do half the job since they are algorithms for mining frequent itemsets another step needs to be done after to generate rules from frequent itemsets found in a database edit apriori algorithm main article apriori algorithm apriori 6 is the best known algorithm to mine association rules it uses a breadth first search strategy to count the support of itemsets and uses a candidate generation function which exploits the downward closure property of support edit eclat algorithm eclat 7 is a depth first search algorithm using set intersection edit fp growth algorithm fp stands for frequent pattern in the first pass the algorithm counts occurrence of items attribute value pairs in the dataset and stores them to header table in the second pass it builds the fp tree structure by inserting instances items in each instance have to be sorted by descending order of their frequency in the dataset so that the tree can be processed quickly items in each instance that do not meet minimum coverage threshold are discarded if many instances share most frequent items fp tree provides high compression close to tree root recursive processing of this compressed version of main dataset grows large item sets directly instead of generating candidate items and testing them against the entire database growth starts from the bottom of the header table having longest branches by finding all instances matching given condition new tree is created with counts projected from the original tree corresponding to the set of instances that are conditional on the attribute with each node getting sum of it s children counts recursive growth ends when no individual items conditional on the attribute meet minimum support threshold and processing continues on the remaining header items of the original fp tree once the recursive process has completed all large item sets with minimum coverage have been found and association rule creation begins 18 edit guha procedure assoc guha is a general method for exploratory data analysis that has theoretical foundations in observational calculi 19 the assoc procedure 20 is a guha method which mines for generalized association rules using fast bitstrings operations the association rules mined by this method are more general than those output by apriori for example items can be connected both with conjunction and disjunctions and the relation between antecedent and consequent of the rule is not restricted to setting minimum support and confidence as in apriori an arbitrary combination of supported interest measures can be used edit opus search opus is an efficient algorithm for rule discovery that in contrast to most alternatives does not require either monotone or anti monotone constraints such as minimum support 21 initially used to find rules for a fixed consequent 21 22 it has subsequently been extended to find rules with any item as a consequent 23 opus search is the core technology in the popular magnum opus association discovery system edit lore a famous story about association rule mining is the beer and diaper story a purported survey of behavior of supermarket shoppers discovered that customers presumably young men who buy diapers tend also to buy beer this anecdote became popular as an example of how unexpected association rules might be found from everyday data there are varying opinions as to how much of the story is true 24 daniel powers says 24 in 1992 thomas blischok manager of a retail consulting group at teradata and his staff prepared an analysis of 1 2 million market baskets from about 25 osco drug stores database queries were developed to identify affinities the analysis did discover that between 5 00 and 7 00 p m that consumers bought beer and diapers osco managers did not exploit the beer and diapers relationship by moving the products closer together on the shelves edit other types of association mining contrast set learning is a form of associative learning contrast set learners use rules that differ meaningfully in their distribution across subsets 25 weighted class learning is another form of associative learning in which weight may be assigned to classes to give focus to a particular issue of concern for the consumer of the data mining results k optimal pattern discovery provides an alternative to the standard approach to association rule learning that requires that each pattern appear frequently in the data mining frequent sequences uses support to find sequences in temporal
