435 members in the house of representatives and 100 members in the senate members of the house of representatives serve two year terms representing the people of a district congressional districts are

shall be vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and a house of representatives the house and senate are equal partners in the legislative process legislation cannot be enacted without the consent of both chambers however the constitution grants each chamber some unique powers the senate ratifies treaties and approves presidential appointments while the house initiates revenue raising bills the house initiates impeachment cases while the senate decides impeachment cases 3 a two thirds vote of the senate is required before an impeached person can be forcibly removed from office 3 in 1868 this committee of representatives prosecuted president andrew johnson in his impeachment trial but the senate did not convict him the term congress can also refer to a particular meeting of the legislature a congress covers two years the current one the 113th congress began on january 3 2013 and would end on january 3 2015 the congress starts and ends on each third day of january by every two years of the odd number members of the senate are referred to as senators members of the house of representatives are referred to as representatives congressmen or congresswomen scholar and representative lee h hamilton asserted that the historic mission of congress has been to maintain freedom and insisted it was a driving force in american government 4 and a remarkably resilient institution 5 congress is the heart and soul of our democracy according to this view 6 even though legislators rarely achieve the prestige or name recognition of presidents or supreme court justices one wrote that legislators remain ghosts in america s historical imagination 6 one analyst argues that it is not a solely reactive institution but has played an active role in shaping government policy and is extraordinarily sensitive to public pressure 6 several academics described congress united states this article is part of the series politics and government of the

strengths and all our weaknesses it reflects our regional idiosyncrasies our ethnic religious and racial diversity our multitude of professions and our shadings of opinion on everything from the value of war to the war over values congress is the government s most representative body congress is essentially charged with reconciling our many points of view on the great public policy issues of the day smith roberts and wielen 4 congress is constantly changing constantly in flux 7 in recent times the american south and west have gained house seats according to demographic changes recorded by the census and includes more minorities and women although both groups are still underrepresented according to one view 7 while power balances among the different parts of government continue to change the internal structure of congress is important to understand along with its interactions with so called intermediary institutions such as political parties civic associations interest groups and the mass media 6 the congress of the united states serves two distinct purposes that overlap local representation to the federal government of a congressional district by representatives and a state s at large representation to the federal government by senators edit history main article history of the united states congress the first continental congress was a gathering of representatives from twelve of the thirteen british colonies in north america 8 on july 4 1776 the second continental congress adopted the declaration of independence referring to the new nation as the united states of america the articles of confederation in 1781 created a unicameral body with equal representation among the states in which each state had a veto over most decisions with no executive or judiciary and minimal authority this government was weak 9 and lacked authority to collect taxes regulate commerce or enforce laws 10 11 george washington presiding over the signing of the united states constitution government powerlessness led to the convention of 1787 which proposed a revised constitution with a two chamber or bicameral congress 12 smaller states argued for equal representation for each state 13 the two chamber structure had functioned well in state governments 7 a compromise plan was adopted with representatives chosen by population benefitting larger states and exactly two senators chosen by state governments benefitting smaller states 7 14 the ratified constitution created a federal structure with two overlapping power centers so that each citizen as an individual was subjected to both the power of state government and the national government 15 16 17 to protect against abuse of power each branch of government executive legislative and judicial had a separate sphere of authority and could check other branches according to the principle of the separation of powers 18 furthermore there were checks and balances within the legislature since there were two separate chambers 19 the new government became active in 1789 18 20 political scientist julian e zelizer suggested there were four main congressional eras with considerable overlap and included the formative era 1780s 1820s the partisan era 1830s 1900s the committee era 1910s 1960s and the contemporary era 1970s today 21 edit the formative era 1780s 1820s federalists and anti federalists jostled for power in the early years as political parties became pronounced surprising the constitution s framers thomas jefferson s election to the presidency marked a peaceful transition of power between the parties in 1800 john marshall 4th chief justice of the supreme court empowered the courts by establishing the principle of judicial review in law in the landmark case marbury v madison in 1803 effectively giving the supreme court a power to nullify congressional legislation edit the partisan era 1830s 1900s these years were marked by growth in the power of political parties the watershed event was the civil war which resolved the slavery issue and unified the nation under federal authority but weakened the power of states rights a gilded age 1877 1901 was marked by republican dominance of congress during this time lobbying activity became more intense particularly during the administration of president ulysses s grant in which influential lobbies advocated for railroad subsidies and tariffs on wool 22 immigration and high birth rates swelled the ranks of citizens and the nation grew at a rapid pace the progressive era was characterized by strong party leadership in both houses of congress as well as calls for reform sometimes reformers would attack lobbyists as corrupting politics 23 the position of speaker of the house became extremely powerful under leaders such as thomas reed in 1890 and joseph gurney cannon the senate was effectively controlled by a half dozen men edit the committee era 1910s 1960s the united states capitol a system of seniority in which long time members of congress gained more and more power encouraged politicians of both parties to serve for long terms committee chairmen remained influential in both houses until the reforms of the 1970s important structural changes included the direct election of senators by popular election according to the seventeenth amendment 14 with positive effects senators more sensitive to public opinion and negative effects undermining the authority of state governments 14 supreme court decisions based on the constitution s commerce clause expanded congressional power to regulate the economy 24 one effect of popular election of senators was to reduce the difference between the house and senate in terms of their link to the electorate 25 lame duck reforms according to the twentieth amendment ended the power of defeated and retiring members of congress to wield influence despite their lack of accountability 26 the great depression ushered in president franklin roosevelt and strong control by democrats 27 and historic new deal policies roosevelt s election in 1932 marked a shift in government power towards the executive branch numerous new deal initiatives came from the white house rather than being initiated by congress 28 the democratic party controlled both houses of congress for many years 29 30 31 during this time republicans and conservative southern democrats 32 formed the conservative coalition 31 33 democrats maintained control of congress during world war ii 34 35 congress struggled with efficiency in the postwar era partly by reducing the number of standing congressional committees 36 southern democrats became a powerful force in many influential committees although political power alternated between republicans and democrats during these years more complex issues required greater specialization and expertise such as space flight and atomic energy policy 36 senator joseph mccarthy exploited the fear of communism and conducted televised hearings 37 38 in 1960 democratic candidate john f kennedy narrowly won the presidency and power shifted again to the democrats who dominated both houses of congress until 1994 edit the contemporary era 1970s today the senate chose archibald cox to serve as special prosecutor investigating watergate congress enacted johnson s great society program to fight poverty and hunger the watergate scandal had a powerful effect of waking up a somewhat dormant congress which investigated presidential wrongdoing and coverups the scandal substantially reshaped relations between the branches of government suggested political scientist bruce j schulman 39 partisanship returned particularly after 1994 one analyst attributes partisan infighting to slim congressional majorities which discouraged friendly social gatherings in meeting rooms such as the board of education 6 congress began reasserting its authority 28 40 lobbying became a big factor despite the 1971 federal election campaign act political action committees or pacs could make substantive donations to congressional candidates via such means as soft money contributions 41 while soft money funds were not given to specific campaigns for candidates the monies often benefited candidates substantially in an indirect way and helped reelect candidates 41 reforms such as the 2002 mccain feingold act limited campaign donations but did not limit soft money contributions 42 one source suggests post watergate laws amended in 1974 meant to reduce the influence of wealthy contributors and end payoffs instead legitimized pacs since they enabled individuals to band together in support of candidates 43 from 1974 to 1984 pacs grew from 608 to 3 803 and donations leaped from 12 5 million to 120 million 43 44 45 along with concern over pac influence in congress 46 47 in 2009 there were 4 600 business labor and special interest pacs 48 including ones for lawyers electricians and real estate brokers 49 from 2007 to 2008 175 members of congress received half or more of their campaign cash from pacs 48 50 51 in the late 20th century the media became more important in congress s work 52 analyst michael schudson suggested that greater publicity undermined the power of political parties and caused more roads to open up in congress for individual representatives to influence decisions 52 norman ornstein suggested that media prominence led to a greater emphasis on the negative and sensational side of congress and referred to this as the tabloidization of media coverage 7 others saw pressure to squeeze a political position into a thirty second soundbite 53 edit congress in the united states government edit powers of congress main article powers of the united states congress edit overview of congressional power article i of the constitution sets forth most of the powers of congress which include numerous explicit powers enumerated in section 8 constitutional amendments have granted congress additional powers congress also has implied powers derived from the constitution s necessary and proper clause congress has authority over financial and budgetary policy through the enumerated power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states there is vast authority over budgets although analyst eric patashnik suggested that much of congress s power to manage the budget has been lost when the welfare state expanded since entitlements were institutionally detached from congress s ordinary legislative routine and rhythm 21 another factor leading to less control over the budget was a keynesian belief that balanced budgets were unnecessary 21 congress s power of the purse authorizes taxing citizens spending money and printing currency the sixteenth amendment in 1913 extended congressional power of taxation to include income taxes 54 the constitution also grants congress the exclusive power to appropriate funds and this power of the purse is one of congress s primary checks on the executive branch 54 congress can borrow money on the credit of the united states regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states and coin money 55 generally both the senate and the house of representatives have equal legislative authority although only the house may originate revenue and appropriation bills 3 congress authorizes defense spending such as the purchase of the uss bon homme richard congress has an important role in national defense including the exclusive power to declare war to raise and maintain the armed forces and to make rules for the military 56 some critics charge that the executive branch has usurped congress s constitutionally defined task of declaring war 57 while historically presidents initiated the process for going to war they asked for and received formal war declarations from congress for the war of 1812 the mexican american war the spanish american war world war i and world war ii 58 although president theodore roosevelt s military move into panama in 1903 did not get congressional approval 58 in the early days after the north korean invasion of 1950 president truman described the american response as a police action 59 according to time magazine in 1970 u s presidents had ordered troops into position or action without a formal congressional declaration a total of 149 times 58 in 1993 michael kinsley wrote that congress s war power has become the most flagrantly disregarded provision in the constitution and that the real erosion of congress s war power began after world war ii 60 61 62 disagreement about the extent of congressional versus presidential power regarding war has been present periodically throughout the nation s history 63 congress can establish post offices and post roads issue patents and copyrights fix standards of weights and measures establish courts inferior to the supreme court and make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof article four gives congress the power to admit new states into the union congress oversees other government branches for example the investigation of president nixon and watergate one of congress s foremost non legislative functions is the power to investigate and oversee the executive branch 64 congressional oversight is usually delegated to committees and is facilitated by congress s subpoena power 65 some critics have charged that congress has in some instances failed to do an adequate job of overseeing the other branches of government in the plame affair critics including representative henry a waxman charged that congress was not doing an adequate job of oversight in this case 66 there have been concerns about congressional oversight of executive actions such as warrantless wiretapping although others respond that congress did investigate the legality of presidential decisions 67 political scientists ornstein and mann suggested that oversight functions do not help members of congress win reelection congress also has the exclusive power of removal allowing impeachment and removal of the president federal judges and other federal officers 68 there have been charges that presidents acting under the doctrine of the unitary executive have assumed important legislative and budgetary powers that should belong to congress 69 so called signing statements are one way in which a president can tip the balance of power between congress and the white house a little more in favor of the executive branch according to one account 70 past presidents including ronald reagan george h w bush bill clinton and george w bush 71 have made public statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it and commentators including the american bar association have described this practice as against the spirit of the constitution 72 73 there have been concerns that presidential authority to cope with financial crises is eclipsing the power of congress 74 in 2008 george f will called the capitol building a tomb for the antiquated idea that the legislative branch matters 75 edit enumerated powers main article powers of the united states congress enumerated powers the constitution details the powers of congress in detail in addition other congressional powers have been granted or confirmed by constitutional amendments the thirteenth 1865 fourteenth 1868 and fifteenth amendments 1870 gave congress authority to enact legislation to enforce rights of african americans including voting rights due process and equal protection under the law 76 generally militia forces are controlled by state governments not congress 77 edit implied powers and the commerce clause congress also has implied powers deriving from the constitution s necessary and proper clause which permit congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof 78 broad interpretations of this clause and of the commerce clause the enumerated power to regulate commerce in rulings such as mcculloch v maryland have effectively widened the scope of congress s legislative authority far beyond that prescribed in section 8 79 80 edit checks and balances main article u s congress in relation to the president and supreme court view of the united states capitol from the united states supreme court building representative lee h hamilton explained how congress functions within the federal government to me the key to understanding it is balance the founders went to great lengths to balance institutions against each other balancing powers among the three branches congress the president and the supreme court between the house of representatives and the senate between the federal government and the states among states of different sizes and regions with different interests between the powers of government and the rights of citizens as spelled out in the bill of rights no one part of government dominates the other 4 the constitution provides checks and balances among the three branches of the federal government its authors expected the greater power to lie with congress as described in article one 4 81 the influence of congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on factors such as congressional leadership presidential political influence historical circumstances such as war and individual initiative by members of congress the impeachment of andrew johnson made the presidency less powerful than congress for a considerable period afterwards 4 the 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as theodore roosevelt wilson fdr nixon reagan and george w bush 82 however in recent years congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 and the war powers resolution nevertheless the presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century 4 82 executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret in return knowing they may be in the dark about executive branch activity congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies 83 many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies and this is a task that congress is ill suited for congress is slow open divided and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or do a good job of overseeing such activity according to one analysis 84 the impeachment trial of president clinton in 1999 chief justice william rehnquist presiding the constitution concentrates removal powers in the congress by empowering and obligating the house of representatives to impeach both executive and judicial officials for treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors impeachment is a formal accusation of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official the senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments a simple majority in the house is required to impeach an official however a two thirds majority in the senate is required for conviction a convicted official is automatically removed from office in addition the senate may stipulate that the defendant be banned from holding office in the future impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this however a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law in the history of the united states the house of representatives has impeached sixteen officials of whom seven were convicted another resigned before the senate could complete the trial only two presidents have ever been impeached andrew johnson in 1868 and bill clinton in 1999 both trials ended in acquittal in johnson s case the senate fell one vote short of the two thirds majority required for conviction in 1974 richard nixon resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the house judiciary committee indicated he would eventually be removed from office the senate has an important check on the executive power by confirming cabinet officials judges and other high officers by and with the advice and consent of the senate it confirms most presidential nominees but rejections are not uncommon furthermore treaties negotiated by the president must be ratified by a two thirds majority vote in the senate to take effect as a result presidential arm twisting of senators can happen before a key vote for example president obama s secretary of state hillary rodham clinton urged her former senate colleagues to approve a nuclear arms treaty with russia in 2010 85 the house of representatives has no formal role in either the ratification of treaties or the appointment of federal officials other than filling vacancies in the office of vice president a vote in each house is required to confirm a president s nomination for vice president if a vacancy happens 3 in 1803 the supreme court established judicial review of federal legislation in marbury v madison holding however that congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the court itself the constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review however the notion that courts could declare laws unconstitutional was envisioned by the founding fathers alexander hamilton for example mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in federalist no 78 originalists on the supreme court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should might or could have said 86 judicial review means that the supreme court can nullify a congressional law it is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially in 1857 for example the supreme court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its dred scott decision 87 at the same time the supreme court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations investigations are conducted to gather information on the need for future legislation to test the effectiveness of laws already passed and to inquire into the qualifications and performance of members and officials of the other branches committees may hold hearings and if necessary compel individuals to testify when investigating issues over which it has the power to legislate by issuing subpoenas 88 89 witnesses who refuse to testify may be cited for contempt of congress and those who testify falsely may be charged with perjury most committee hearings are open to the public the house and senate intelligence committees are the exception important hearings are widely reported in the mass media and transcripts published a few months afterwards 89 congress in the course of studying possible laws and investigating matters generates an incredible amount of information in various forms and can be described as a publisher 90 indeed it publishes house and senate reports 90 and maintains databases which are updated irregularly with publications in a variety of electronic formats 90 congress also plays a role in presidential elections both houses meet in joint session on the sixth day of january following a presidential election to count the electoral votes and there are procedures to follow if no candidate wins a majority 3 the main result of congressional activity is the creation of laws 91 most of which are contained in the united states code arranged by subject matter alphabetically under fifty title headings to present the laws in a concise and usable form 92 edit structure main article structure of the u s congress congress is split into two chambers house and senate and manages the huge task of writing national legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas some members of congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees further congress has ancillary organizations such as the government accountability office and the library of congress to help provide it with information and members of congress have staff and offices to assist them as well in addition a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests edit committees main article united states congressional committee second committee room in congress hall in philadelphia edit specialization the committee structure permits members of congress to study a particular subject intensely it is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before congress 93 as time goes by members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects committees investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire congress about choices and trade offs the choice of specialty may be influenced by the member s constituency important regional issues prior background and experience 94 senators often choose a different specialty from that of the other senator from their state to prevent overlap 95 some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation for example the house ways and means committee has considerable influence over house affairs 96 edit power committees write legislation while procedures such as the house discharge petition process can introduce bills to the house floor and effectively bypass committee input they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action committees have power and have been called independent fiefdoms legislative oversight and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and subcommittees which gather information evaluate alternatives and identify problems 97 they propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber 97 in addition they perform the function of oversight by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing 97 edit officers at the start of each two year session the house elects a speaker who does not normally preside over debates but serves as the majority party s leader in the senate the vice president is the ex officio president of the senate in addition the senate elects an officer called the president pro tempore pro tempore means for the time being and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the senate s majority party and customarily keeps this position until there s a change in party control accordingly the senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new congress in both the house and senate the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber edit support services edit library of congress main article library of congress the library of congress was established by an act of congress in 1800 it is primarily housed in three buildings on capitol hill but also includes several other sites the national library service for the blind and physically handicapped in washington d c the national audio visual conservation center in culpeper virginia a large book storage facility located at ft meade maryland and multiple overseas offices the library had mostly law books when it was burned by a british raiding party during the war of 1812 but the library s collections were restored and expanded when congress authorized the purchase of thomas jefferson s private library one of the library s missions is to serve the congress and its staff as well as the american public it is the largest library in the world with nearly 150 million items including books films maps photographs music manuscripts graphics and materials in 470 languages 98 edit congressional research service main article congressional research service the congressional research service provides detailed up to date and non partisan research for senators representatives and their staff to help them carry out their official duties it provides ideas for legislation helps members analyze a bill facilitates public hearings makes reports consults on matters such as parliamentary procedure and helps the two chambers resolve disagreements it has been called the house s think tank and has a staff of about 900 employees 99 edit congressional budget office main article congressional budget office the congressional budget office or cbo is a federal agency which provides economic data to congress 100 it was created as an independent nonpartisan agency by the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 it helps congress estimate revenue inflows from taxes and helps the budgeting process it makes projections about such matters as the national debt 101 as well as likely costs of legislation it prepares an annual economic and budget outlook with a mid year update and writes an analysis of the president s budgetary proposals for the senate s appropriations committee the speaker of the house and the senate s president pro tempore jointly appoint the cbo director for a four year term edit lobbyists main article lobbying in the united states lobbyists represent diverse interests and often seek to influence congressional decisions to reflect their clients needs lobby groups and their members sometimes write legislation and whip bills in 2007 there were approximately 17 000 federal lobbyists in washington 102 they explain to legislators the goals of their organizations some lobbyists represent non profit organizations and work pro bono for issues in which they are personally interested edit partisanship versus bipartisanship congress has alternated between periods of constructive cooperation and compromise between parties known as bipartisanship and periods of fierce political infighting known as partisanship the period after the civil war was marked by partisanship as is the case today it is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades 103 but that an alternation of control of congress between democrats and republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution 104 edit procedures of congress main article procedures of the u s congress edit sessions a term of congress is divided into two sessions one for each year congress has occasionally been called into an extra or special session a new session commences on january 3 each year unless congress decides differently the constitution requires congress meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the capitol edit joint sessions main article joint session of the united states congress joint sessions of the united states congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from both house and senate these sessions include counting electoral votes after a presidential election and the president s state of the union address the constitutionally mandated report normally given as an annual speech is modeled on britain s speech from the throne was written by most presidents after jefferson but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with wilson in 1913 joint sessions and joint meetings are traditionally presided over by the speaker of the house except when counting presidential electoral votes when the vice president presides edit bills and resolutions see also list of united states federal legislation the house financial services committee meets committee members sit in the tiers of raised chairs while those testifying and audience members sit below ideas for legislation can come from members lobbyists state legislatures constituents legislative counsel or executive agencies anyone can write a bill but only members of congress may introduce bills most bills are not written by congress members but originate from the executive branch interest groups often draft bills as well the usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review 105 a proposal is usually in one of these forms bills are laws in the making a house originated bill begins with the letters h r for house of representatives followed by a number kept as it progresses 91 joint resolutions there is little difference between a bill and a joint resolution since both are treated similarly a joint resolution originating from the house for example begins h j res followed by its number 91 concurrent resolutions affect only both house and senate and accordingly are not presented to the president for approval later in the house it begins with h con res 91 simple resolutions concern only the house or only the senate and begin with h res 91 representatives introduce a bill while the house is in session by placing it in the hopper on the clerk s desk 91 it s assigned a number and referred to a committee which studies each bill intensely at this stage 91 drafting statutes requires great skill knowledge and experience and sometimes take a year or more 105 sometimes lobbyists write legislation and submit it to a member for introduction joint resolutions are the normal way to propose a constitutional amendment or declare war on the other hand concurrent resolutions passed by both houses and simple resolutions passed by only one house do not have the force of law but express the opinion of congress or regulate procedure bills may be introduced by any member of either house however the constitution provides that all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives while the senate cannot originate revenue and appropriation bills it has power to amend or reject them congress has sought ways to establish appropriate spending levels 106 each chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the constitution or prescribed by law in the house a rules committee guides legislation in the senate a standing rules committee is in charge each branch has its own traditions for example the senate relies heavily on the practice of getting unanimous consent for noncontroversial matters 107 house and senate rules can be complex sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before becoming a law 4 members sometimes use experts such as walter oleszek a senior specialist in american national government at the congressional research service to learn about proper procedures 108 each bill goes through several stages in each house including consideration by a committee and advice from the government accountability office 109 most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as agriculture or appropriations the house has twenty standing committees the senate has sixteen standing committees meet at least once each month 109 almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must be open to the public unless the committee votes publicly to close the meeting 109 a committee might call for public hearings on important bills 109 each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill 91 then a bill may go to what s called a mark up session where committee members debate the bill s merits and may offer amendments or revisions 91 committees may also amend the bill but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments after debate the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house if a bill is tabled then it is rejected if amendments are extensive sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so called clean bill with a new number 91 both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used generally members who have been in congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power 110 a bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex 91 and begins with an enacting formula such as be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled consideration of a bill requires itself a rule which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debate time limits possibility of further amendments and such 91 each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak 91 sometimes opponents seek to recommit a bill which means to change part of it 91 generally discussion requires a quorum usually half of the total number of representatives before discussion can begin although there are exceptions 111 the house may debate and amend the bill the precise procedures used by the house and senate differ a final vote on the bill follows once a bill is approved by one house it is sent to the other which may pass reject or amend it for the bill to become law both houses must agree to identical versions of the bill 91 if the second house amends the bill then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a conference committee an ad hoc committee that includes both senators and representatives 91 sometimes by using a reconciliation process to limit budget bills 106 both houses use a budget enforcement mechanism informally known as pay as you go or paygo which discourages members from considering acts which increase budget deficits 106 if both houses agree to the version reported by the conference committee the bill passes otherwise it fails the constitution specifies that a majority of members known as a quorum be present before doing business in each house however the rules of each house assume that a quorum is present unless a quorum call demonstrates the contrary since representatives and senators who are present rarely demand quorum calls debate often continues despite the lack of a majority voting within congress can take many forms including systems using lights and bells and electronic voting 112 both houses use voice voting to decide most matters in which members shout aye or no and the presiding officer announces the result the constitution however requires a recorded vote if demanded by one fifth of the members present if the voice vote is unclear or if the matter is controversial a recorded vote usually happens the senate uses roll call voting in which a clerk calls out the names of all the senators each senator stating aye or no when his or her name is announced in the senate the vice president may cast the tiebreaking vote if present the house reserves roll call votes for the most formal matters as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time normally members vote by using an electronic device in the case of a tie the motion in question fails most votes in the house are done electronically allowing members to vote yea or nay or present or open 112 members insert a voting id card and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose in addition paper ballots are used on some occasions yea indicated by green and nay by red 112 one member can not cast a proxy vote for another 112 congressional votes are recorded on an online database 113 114 after passage by both houses a bill is enrolled and sent to the president for approval 91 the president may sign it making it law or veto it perhaps returning it to congress with his objections a vetoed bill can still become law if each house of congress votes to override the veto with a two thirds majority finally the president may do nothing neither signing nor vetoing the bill and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days not counting sundays according to the constitution but if congress is adjourned during this period presidents may veto legislation passed at the end of a congressional session simply by ignoring it the maneuver is known as a pocket veto and cannot be overridden by the adjourned congress edit congress and the public main article u s congress and citizens edit challenges of reelection edit citizens and representatives senators face reelection every six years and representatives every two reelections encourage candidates to focus their publicity efforts at their home states or districts 52 running for reelection can be a grueling process of distant travel and fund raising which distracts senators and representatives from paying attention to governing according to some critics 115 115 although others respond that the process is necessary to keep members of congress in touch with voters in this example the more even distribution is on the left and the gerrymandering is on the right nevertheless incumbent members of congress running for reelection have strong advantages over challengers 41 they raise more money 46 because donors expect incumbents to win they give their funds to them rather than challengers 44 116 and donations are vital for winning elections 117 one critic compared being elected to congress to receiving life tenure at a university 116 another advantage for representatives is the practice of gerrymandering 118 119 after each ten year census states are allocated representatives based on population and officials in power can choose how to draw the congressional district boundaries to support candidates from their party as a result reelection rates of members of congress hover around 90 percent 1 causing some critics to accuse them of being a privileged class 7 academics such as princeton s stephen macedo have proposed solutions to fix gerrymandering both senators and representatives enjoy free mailing privileges called franking privileges edit expensive campaigns in 1971 the cost of running for congress in utah was 70 000 120 but costs have climbed 121 the biggest expense is television ads 45 116 120 122 123 today s races cost more than a million dollars for a house seat and six million or more for a senate seat 7 45 122 124 125 since fundraising is vital members of congress are forced to spend ever increasing hours raising money for their re election 126 nevertheless the supreme court has treated campaign contributions as a free speech issue 121 some see money as a good influence in politics since it enables candidates to communicate with voters 121 few members retire from congress without complaining about how much it costs to campaign for reelection 7 critics contend that members of congress are more likely to attend to the needs of heavy campaign contributors than to ordinary citizens 7 elections are influenced by many variables some political scientists speculate there is a coattail effect when a popular president or party position has the effect of reelecting incumbents who win by riding on the president s coattails although there is some evidence that the coattail effect is irregular and possibly declining since the 1950s 41 some districts are so heavily democratic or republican that they are called a safe seat any candidate winning the primary will almost always be elected and these candidates do not need to spend money on advertising 127 128 but some races can be competitive when there is no incumbent if a seat becomes vacant in an open district then both parties may spend heavily on advertising in these races in california in 1992 only four of twenty races for house seats were considered highly competitive 129 edit television and negative advertising since members of congress must advertise heavily on television this usually involves negative advertising which smears an opponent s character without focusing on the issues 130 negative advertising is seen as effective because the messages tend to stick 131 however these ads sour the public on the political process in general as most members of congress seek to avoid blame 132 one wrong decision or one damaging television image can mean defeat at the next election which leads to a culture of risk avoidance a need to make policy decisions behind closed doors 132 and concentrating publicity efforts in the members home districts 52 edit public perceptions of congress the federalist papers argued in favor of a strong connection between citizens and their representatives prominent founding fathers writing in the federalist papers felt elections were essential to liberty and that a bond between the people and the representatives was particularly essential 133 and that frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured 133 in 2009 however few americans were familiar with leaders of congress 134 135 136 the percentage of americans eligible to vote who did in fact vote was 63 in 1960 but has been falling since although there was a slight upward trend in the 2008 election 137 public opinion polls asking people if they approve of the job congress is doing have in the last few decades hovered around 25 with some variation 7 138 139 140 141 142 143 scholar julian zeliger suggested that the size messiness virtues and vices that make congress so interesting also create enormous barriers to our understanding the institution unlike the presidency congress is difficult to conceptualize 144 other scholars suggest that despite the criticism congress is a remarkably resilient institution its place in the political process is not threatened it is rich in resources and that most members behave ethically 5 they contend that congress is easy to dislike and often difficult to defend and this perception is exacerbated because many challengers running for congress run against congress which is an old form of american politics that further undermines congress s reputation with the public 7 the rough and tumble world of legislating is not orderly and civil human frailties too often taint its membership and legislative outcomes are often frustrating and ineffective still we are not exaggerating when we say that congress is essential to american democracy we would not have survived as a nation without a congress that represented the diverse interests of our society conducted a public debate on the major issues found compromises to resolve conflicts peacefully and limited the power of our executive military and judicial institutions the popularity of congress ebbs and flows with the public s confidence in government generally the legislative process is easy to dislike it often generates political posturing and grandstanding it necessarily involves compromise and it often leaves broken promises in its trail also members of congress often appear self serving as they pursue their political careers and represent interests and reflect values that are controversial scandals even when they involve a single member add to the public s frustration with congress and have contributed to the institution s low ratings in opinion polls smith roberts amp wielen 7 an additional factor that confounds public perceptions of congress is that congressional issues are becoming more technical and complex and require expertise in subjects such as science and engineering and economics 7 as a result congress often cedes authority to experts at the executive branch 7 edit smaller states and bigger states when the constitution was ratified in 1787 the ratio of the populations of large states to small states was roughly twelve to one the connecticut compromise gave every state large and small an equal vote in the senate 145 since each state has two senators residents of smaller states have more clout in the senate than residents of larger states but since 1787 the population disparity between large and small states has grown in 2006 for example california had seventy times the population of wyoming 146 critics such as constitutional scholar sanford levinson have suggested that the population disparity works against residents of large states and causes a steady redistribution of resources from large states to small states 147 148 149 however others argue that the connecticut compromise was deliberately intended by the framers to construct the senate so that each state had equal footing not based on population 145 and contend that the result works well on balance edit members and constituents a major role for members of congress is providing services to constituents 150 constituents request assistance with problems 151 providing services helps members of congress win votes and elections 118 152 153 and can make a difference in close races 154 congressional staff can help citizens navigate government bureaucracies 4 one academic described the complex intertwined relation between lawmakers and constituents as home style 155 edit congressional style one way to categorize lawmakers according to political scientist richard fenno is by their general motivation reelection these are lawmakers who never met a voter they didn t like and provide excellent constituent services good public policy legislators who burnish a reputation for policy expertise and leadership power in the chamber lawmakers who spend serious time along the rail of the house floor or in the senate cloakroom ministering to the needs of their colleagues famous legislator henry clay in the mid 19th century was described as an issue entrepreneur who looked for issues to serve his ambitions 155 gridlock unless congress can begin to work together though compromise each member will be removed by one means or another i e by cpa edit privileges and pay edit privileges protecting members members of congress enjoy parliamentary privilege including freedom from arrest in all cases except for treason felony and breach of the peace and freedom of speech in debate this constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions 156 the term arrest has been interpreted broadly and includes any detention or delay in the course of law enforcement including court summons and subpoenas the rules of the house strictly guard this privilege a member may not waive the privilege on his or her own but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so senate rules however are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose the constitution guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses providing in the speech or debate clause of the constitution that for any speech or debate in either house they shall not be questioned in any other place accordingly a member of congress may not be sued in court for slander because of remarks made in either house although each house has its own rules restricting offensive speeches and may punish members who transgress them obstructing the work of congress is a crime under federal law and is known as contempt of congress each branch has the power to cite individuals for contempt but can only issue a contempt citation the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal case if convicted in court an individual found guilty of contempt of congress may be imprisoned for up to one year the franking privilege allows members of congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense though they are not permitted to send election materials borderline material is often sent especially in the run up to an election by those in close races 157 158 indeed some academics consider free mailings as giving incumbents a big advantage over challengers 1 159 edit pay and benefits from 1789 to 1815 members of congress received only a daily payment of 6 while in session members received an annual salary of 1 500 per year from 1815 to 1817 then a per diem salary of 8 from 1818 to 1855 since then they have received an annual salary first pegged in 1855 at 3 000 160 161 in 1907 salaries were raised to 7 500 per year the equivalent of 173 000 in 2010 dollars 161 in 2006 members of congress received a yearly salary of 165 200 161 congressional leaders were paid 183 500 per year the speaker of the house of representatives earns 212 100 annually the salary of the president pro tempore for 2006 was 183 500 equal to that of the majority and minority leaders of the house and senate 162 privileges include having an office and paid staff 110 in 2008 non officer members of congress earned 169 300 annually 138 some critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median american income of 45 113 for men and 35 102 for women 163 others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government 138 congress has been criticized for trying to conceal pay raises by slipping them into a large bill at the last minute 164 others have criticized the wealth of members of congress 120 123 representative jim cooper of tennessee told harvard professor lawrence lessig that a chief problem with congress was that members focused on lucrative careers as lobbyists after serving that congress was a farm league for k street instead of on public service 165 166 members elected since 1984 are covered by the federal employees retirement system fers like other federal employees congressional retirement is funded through taxes and participants contributions members of congress under fers contribute 1 3 of their salary into the fers retirement plan and pay 6 2 of their salary in social security taxes and like federal employees members contribute one third of the cost of health insurance with the government covering the other two thirds 167 the size of a congressional pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest three years of his or her salary by law the starting amount of a member s retirement annuity may not exceed 80 of his or her final salary in 2006 the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under the civil service retirement system csrs was 60 972 while those who retired under fers or in combination with csrs was 35 952 168 members of congress make fact finding missions to learn about other countries and stay informed but these outings can cause controversy if the trip is deemed excessive or unconnected with the task of governing for example the wall street journal reported lawmaker trips abroad at taxpayer expense which included spas 300 per night extra unused rooms and shopping excursions 169 lawmakers respond that traveling with spouses compensates for being away from them a lot in washington and justify the trips as a way to meet officials in other nations 169 edit see also government of the united states portal caucuses of the united states congress elections in the
