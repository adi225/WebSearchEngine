computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of geometry some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry the main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in computer graphics and computer aided design and manufacturing cad cam but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature and may come from mathematical visualization other important applications of computational geometry include robotics motion planning and visibility problems geographic information systems gis geometrical location and search route planning integrated circuit design ic geometry design and verification computer aided engineering cae mesh generation computer vision 3d reconstruction the main branches of computational geometry are combinatorial computational geometry also called algorithmic geometry which deals with geometric objects as discrete entities a groundlaying book in the subject by preparata and shamos dates the first use of the term computational geometry in this sense by 1975 1 numerical computational geometry also called machine geometry computer aided geometric design cagd or geometric modeling which deals primarily with representing real world objects in forms suitable for computer computations in cad cam systems this branch may be seen as a further development of descriptive geometry and is often considered a branch of computer graphics or cad the term computational geometry in this meaning has been in use since 1971 2 contents 1 combinatorial computational geometry 1 1 problem classes 1 1 1 static problems 1 1 2

solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects points line segments polygons polyhedra etc some of these problems seem so simple that they were not regarded as problems at all until the advent of computers consider for example the closest pair problem given n points in the plane find the two with the smallest distance from each other one could compute the distances between all the pairs of points of which there are n n 1 2 then pick the pair with the smallest distance this brute force algorithm takes o n 2 time i e its execution time is proportional to the square of the number of points a classic result in computational geometry was the formulation of an algorithm that takes o n log n randomized algorithms that take o n expected time as well as a deterministic algorithm that takes o n log log n time have also been discovered citation needed computational geometry focuses heavily on computational complexity since the algorithms are meant to be used on very large datasets containing tens or hundreds of millions of points for large data sets the difference between o n 2 and o n log n can be the difference between days and seconds of computation edit problem classes the core problems in computational geometry may be classified in different ways according to various criteria the following general classes may be distinguished edit static problems in the problems of this category some input is given and the corresponding output needs to be constructed or found some fundamental problems of this type are convex hull given a set of points find the smallest convex polyhedron polygon containing all the points line segment intersection find the intersections between a given set of line segments delaunay triangulation voronoi diagram given a set of points partition the space according to which points are closest to the given points linear programming closest pair of points given a set of points find the two with the smallest distance from each other euclidean shortest path connect two points in a euclidean space with polyhedral obstacles by a shortest path polygon triangulation given a polygon partition its interior into triangles mesh generation the computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by the time and space computer memory required to solve a given problem instance edit geometric query problems in geometric query problems commonly known as geometric search problems the input consists of two parts the search space part and the query part which varies over the problem instances the search space typically needs to be preprocessed in a way that multiple queries can be answered efficiently some fundamental geometric query problems are range searching preprocess a set of points in order to efficiently count the number of points inside a query region point location given a partitioning of the space into cells produce a data structure that efficiently tells in which cell a query point is located nearest neighbor preprocess a set of points in order to efficiently find which point is closest to a query point ray tracing given a set of objects in space produce a data structure that efficiently tells which object a query ray intersects first if the search space is fixed the computational complexity for this class of problems is usually estimated by the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in the time and sometimes an extra space to answer queries for the case when the search space is allowed to vary see dynamic problems edit dynamic problems yet another major class is the dynamic problems in which the goal is to find an efficient algorithm for finding a solution repeatedly after each incremental modification of the input data addition or deletion input geometric elements algorithms for problems of this type typically involve dynamic data structures any of the computational geometric problems may be converted into a dynamic one at the cost of increased processing time for example the range searching problem may be converted into the dynamic range searching problem by providing for addition and or deletion of the points the dynamic convex hull problem is to keep track of the convex hull e g for the dynamically changing set of points i e while the input points are inserted or deleted the computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in the time and space to modify the searched data structure after an incremental change in the search space the time and sometimes an extra space to answer a query edit variations some problems may be treated as belonging to either of the categories depending on the context for example consider the following problem point in polygon decide whether a point is inside or outside a given polygon in many applications this problem is treated as a single shot one i e belonging to the first class for example in many applications of computer graphics a common problem is to find which area on the screen is clicked by a pointer however in some applications the polygon in question is invariant while the point represents a query for example the input polygon may represent a border of a country and a point is a position of an aircraft and the problem is to determine whether the aircraft violated the border finally in the previously mentioned example of computer graphics in cad applications the changing input data are often stored in dynamic data structures which may be exploited to speed up the point in polygon queries in some contexts of query problems there are reasonable expectations on the sequence of the queries which may be exploited either for efficient data structures or for tighter computational complexity estimates for example in some cases it is important to know the worst case for the total time for the whole sequence of n queries rather than for a single query see also amortized analysis edit numerical computational geometry main article computer aided geometric design this branch is also known as geometric modelling and computer aided geometric design cagd core problems are curve and surface modelling and representation the most important instruments here are parametric curves and parametric surfaces such as bezier curves spline curves and surfaces an important non parametric approach is the level set method application areas include shipbuilding aircraft and automotive industries the modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by shipbuilders of 1960s edit see also list of combinatorial computational geometry topics list of numerical computational
