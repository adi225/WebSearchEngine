engines and wikipedia policies see here and a search engine tutorial google search or google web search is a web search engine owned by google inc google search is the most used search engine on the world wide web 4 receiving several hundred million queries each day through its various services 5 the order of search results on google s search results pages is based in part on a priority rank called a pagerank google search provides many options for customized search using boolean operators such as exclusion xx alternatives xx or yy and wildcards x x 6 the main purpose of google search is to hunt for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers in formats such as html pdf etc as opposed to other data such as with google image search google search was originally developed by larry page and sergey brin in 1997 7 google search provides at least 22 special features beyond the original word search capability 8 these include synonyms weather forecasts time zones stock quotes maps earthquake data movie showtimes airports home listings and sports scores there are special features for dates including ranges 70 73 9 prices temperatures money unit conversions 10 5 160 cm in inches calculations 3 4 sqrt 6 pi 2 package tracking patents area codes 8 and language translation of displayed pages in june 2011 google introduced google voice search and search by image features for allowing the users to search words by speaking and by giving images 10 in may 2012 google introduced a new knowledge graph semantic search feature to customers in the u s the frequency of use of many search terms has reached such a volume that they may indicate broader economic social and health trends 11 data about the frequency of use of search terms on google available through google adwords google trends and google insights for search have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and government surveys major competitors of google are baidu and soso com in china and south korea naver com in south korea yandex in russia seznam cz in czech republic yahoo in japan and

pagerank google s rise to success was in large part due to a patented algorithm called pagerank that helps rank web pages that match a given search string 13 when google was a stanford research project it was nicknamed backrub because the technology checks backlinks to determine a site s importance previous keyword based methods of ranking search results used by many search engines that were once more popular than google would rank pages by how often the search terms occurred in the page or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page the pagerank algorithm instead analyzes human generated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are themselves likely to be important the algorithm computes a recursive score for pages based on the weighted sum of the pageranks of the pages linking to them pagerank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance in addition to pagerank google over the years has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of pages on result lists reported to be over 250 different indicators 14 the specifics of which are kept secret to keep spammers at bay and help google maintain an edge over its competitors globally edit search results the exact percentage of the total of web pages that google indexes is not known as it is very difficult to accurately calculate google presents a two line summary and also a preview of each search result which includes a link to a cached stored usually older version of the page google s cache link in its search results provides a way of retrieving information from websites that have recently gone down and a way of retrieving data more quickly than by clicking the direct link this feature is still available but many users are not aware of this because it has been moved to the previews of the search results presented next to these 15 16 google not only indexes and caches web pages but also takes snapshots of other file types which include pdf word documents excel spreadsheets flash swf plain text files and so on 17 except in the case of text and swf files the cached version is a conversion to x html allowing those without the corresponding viewer application to read the file users can customize the search engine by setting a default language using the safesearch filtering technology and set the number of results shown on each page google has been criticized for placing long term cookies on users machines to store these preferences a tactic which also enables them to track a user s search terms and retain the data for more than a year citation needed for any query up to the first 1000 results can be shown with a maximum of 100 displayed per page the ability to specify the number of results is available only if instant search is not enabled if instant search is enabled only 10 results are displayed regardless of this setting original research in 2012 google changed its rankings to demote sites that had been accused of piracy excepting the google owned youtube site 18 edit non indexable data despite its immense index there is also a considerable amount of data available in online databases which are accessible by means of queries but not by links this so called invisible or deep web is minimally covered by google and other search engines 19 the deep web contains library catalogs official legislative documents of governments phone books and other content which is dynamically prepared to respond to a query edit google optimization main article search engine optimization since google is the most popular search engine many webmasters have become eager to influence their website s google rankings an industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on google and on other search engines this field called search engine optimization attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their client s sites search engine optimization encompasses both on page factors like body copy title elements h1 heading elements and image alt attribute values and off page optimization factors like anchor text and pagerank the general idea is to affect google s relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places on page in particular the title element and the body copy note the higher up in the page presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking too many occurrences of the keyword however cause the page to look suspect to google s spam checking algorithms google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants 20 it has been hypothesized and allegedly is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints that negative publicity for example numerous consumer complaints may serve as well to elevate page rank on google search as favorable comments 21 the particular problem addressed in the new york times article which involved decormyeyes was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the google algorithm according to google it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about decormyeyes which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against it google webmaster tools helps to check for websites that use duplicate or copyright content 22 edit functionality image of definition link provided for many search terms google search consists of a series of localized websites the largest of those the google com site is the top most visited website in the world 23 some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words the number of results you got on your search links to other searches e g for words that google believes to be misspelled it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling and many more edit search syntax google s search engine normally accepts queries as a simple text and breaks up the user s text into a sequence of search terms which will usually be words that are to occur in the results but one can also use boolean operators such as quotations marks for a phrase a prefix such as for qualified terms no longer valid the was removed from google on october 19 2011 24 or one of several advanced operators such as site the webpages of google search basics 25 describe each of these additional queries and options see below search options google s advanced search web form gives several additional fields which may be used to qualify searches by such criteria as date of first retrieval all advanced queries transform to regular queries usually with additional qualified term edit query expansion google applies query expansion to the submitted search query transforming it into the query that will actually be used to retrieve results as with page ranking the exact details of the algorithm google uses are deliberately obscure but certainly the following transformations are among those that occur term reordering in information retrieval this is a standard technique to reduce the work involved in retrieving results this transformation is invisible to the user since the results ordering uses the original query order to determine relevance stemming is used to increase search quality by keeping small syntactic variants of search terms 26 there is a limited facility to fix possible misspellings in queries edit i m feeling lucky google s homepage includes a button labeled i m feeling lucky when a user types in a search and clicks on the button the user will be taken directly to the first search result bypassing the search engine results page the thought is that if a user is feeling lucky the search engine will return the perfect match the first time without having to page through the search results however with the introduction of google instant it is not possible to use the button properly unless the google instant function is switched off according to a study by tom chavez of rapt this feature costs google 110 million a year as 1 of all searches use this feature and bypass all advertising 27 google chrome and mozilla firefox used lucky search as the default search string when the user entered a query in the location bar this functionality was deprecated in later versions but can be brought back in mozilla firefox by setting the keyword url string to http www google com search ie utf 8 amp oe utf 8 amp sourceid navclient amp btni 1 amp q on the page about config on october 30 2009 for some users the i m feeling lucky button was removed from google s main page along with the regular search button both buttons were replaced with a field that reads this space intentionally left blank this text faded out when the mouse was moved on the page and normal search functionality is achieved by filling in the search field with the desired terms and pressing enter a google spokesperson explains this is just a test and a way for us to gauge whether our users will like an even simpler search interface 28 personalized google homepages retained both buttons and their normal functions on may 21 2010 the 30th anniversary of pac man the i m feeling lucky button was replaced with a button reading the words insert coin after pressing the button the user would begin a google themed game of pac man in the area where the google logo would normally be pressing the button a second time would begin a two player version of the same game that includes ms pacman for player 2 this version can be accessed at www google com pacman 29 as a permanent link to the page also in 2012 when the mouse cursor is put over the i m feeling lucky button the button changes text varying from i m feeling stellar to i m feeling artistic and so on when the button is clicked the user is redirected to pages and searches in google related to that specific topic displayed for example when someone clicks i m feeling stellar that person may be redirected to the search about reflection nebulae or transported to the google earth explore section about the hubble telescope etc edit rich snippets on may 12 2009 google announced that they would be parsing the hcard hreview and hproduct microformats and using them to populate search result pages with what they called rich snippets 30 edit special features besides the main search engine feature of

number to an exponent power and percentages are allowed 40 of 300 9 following the convention used in discrete mathematics google s calculator evaluates 0 0 to 1 32 the calculator also can calculate digital storage arithmetic the calculation of bytes for example putting in 400mb 489mb 1 5gb yields the result 2425mb or 2 37gb this is useful since bytes are binary power of 2 and not decimal as regular numbers are power of 10 numeric ranges a set of numbers can be matched by using a double dot between range numbers 70 73 or 90 100 to match any positive number in the range inclusive 9

response to the heavy use of google by search engine optimization companies to check on ranks of sites they were optimizing the message is triggered by high volumes of requests from a single ip address google apparently uses the google cookie as part of its determination of refusing service 34 in june 2009 after the death of pop superstar michael jackson this message appeared to many internet users who were searching google for news stories related to the singer and was assumed by google to be a ddos attack although many queries were submitted by legitimate searchers edit january

including facebook and twitter 42 google developers noted that most users would notice little immediate change but invited developers to test the new search in its sandbox 44 differences noted for their impact upon search engine optimization included heavier keyword weighting and the importance of the domain s age 45 46 the move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to microsoft s recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service renamed bing 47 google announced completion of caffeine on june 8 2010 claiming 50 fresher results due to continuous updating of its index 48 with caffeine google moved its back end indexing system away from mapreduce and onto bigtable the company s distributed database platform 49 caffeine is also based on colossus or gfs2 50 an

search can be traced in several ways when using a search engine through a browser program on a computer search terms and other information will usually be stored on the computer by default unless steps are taken to erase them an internet service provider may store records which relate search terms to an ip address and a time the search engine provider e g google may keep logs with the same information 53 whether such logs are kept and access to them by law enforcement agencies is subject to legislation and working practices the law may mandate prohibit or say nothing about logging of

instant to save users 2 to 5 seconds in every search collectively about 11 million seconds per hour 58 search engine marketing pundits speculate that google instant will have a great impact on local and paid search 59 to celebrate the launch of google instant a google doodle was posted on the home page in the interactive doodle users were able to roll their cursor over a series of colored dots that made up the logo when the cursor touched a group of dots the dots would seemingly go up into the air via 3d effects 60 instant search can be disabled via google s preferences menu but
