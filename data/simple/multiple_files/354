books the other search providers available users could still access other search engines via the mobile browser 57 edit bing it on in 2012 a bing marketing campaign asked the public which search engine they believed was better when its results were presented without branding similar to the pepsi challenge in the 1970s 58 59 this poll was nicknamed bing it on 60 61 microsoft presented a study of almost 1 000 people 62 which showed that 57 of participants in such a test preferred bing s results with only 30 preferring google 63 edit name origin through focus groups microsoft decided that the name bing was memorable short easy to spell and that it would function well as a url around the world the word would remind people of the sound made during the moment of discovery and decision making 64 microsoft was assisted by branding consultancy interbrand in their search for the best name for the new search engine 65 the name also has strong similarity to the word bingo which is used to mean that something sought has been found or realized as is interjected when winning the game bingo microsoft advertising strategist david webster originally proposed the name bang for the same reasons the name bing was ultimately chosen easy to spell one syllable and easy to remember he noted it s there it s an exclamation point it s the opposite of a question mark this name was ultimately not chosen because it could not be properly used as a verb in the context of an internet search 66 according to the guardian microsoft hasn t confirmed that it stands recursively for bing is not google but that s the sort of joke software engineers enjoy 67 qi lu president of microsoft online services also announced that bing s official chinese name is b y ng simplified chinese traditional chinese which literally means very certain to respond or very certain to answer in chinese 68 while being tested internally by microsoft employees bing s codename was kumo 69 which came from the japanese word for spider kumo as well as cloud kumo referring to the manner in which search engines spider internet resources to add them to their database as well as cloud computing edit legal challenges on july 31 2009 the laptop company inc released a press release stating that it is challenging bing s trademark application alleging that bing may cause confusion in the marketplace as bing and their product bongobing both do online product search 70 software company terabyte unlimited which has a product called bootit next generation abbreviated to bing also contended the trademark application on similar grounds as did a missouri based design company called bing information design 71 microsoft contends that claims challenging its trademark are without merit because these companies filed for u s federal trademark applications only after microsoft filed for the bing trademark in march 2009 72 edit adult content edit video content bing s video search tool has a preview mode that could potentially be used to preview pornographic videos 73 by simply turning off safe search users can search for and view pornographic videos by hovering the cursor over a thumbnail since the video and audio in some cases are cached on microsoft s server citation needed since the videos are playing within bing instead of the site where they are hosted the videos are not necessarily blocked by parental control filters monitoring programs designed to tell parents what sites their children have visited are likely to simply report bing com instead of the site that actually hosts the video the same situation can be said about corporate filters many of which have been fooled by this feature 74 users do not need to leave bing s site to view these videos 75 76 microsoft responded in a blog post on june 4 2009 with a short term work around 77 by adding amp adlt strict to the end of a query no matter what the settings are for that session it will return results as if safe search were set to strict the query would look like this http www bing com videos search q adulttermgoeshere amp adlt strict case sensitive on june 12 2009 microsoft announced two changes regarding bing s smart motion preview and safesearch features all potentially explicit content will be coming from a separate single domain explicit bing net additionally bing will also return source url information in the query string for image and video contents both changes allow both home users and corporate users to filter content by domain regardless of what the safesearch settings might be 78 edit regional censorship bing censors results for adult search terms for some of the regions including india people s republic of china germany and arab countries 79 this censoring is done based on the local laws of those countries 80 however bing allows users to simply change their country region preference to somewhere without restrictions such as the united states united kingdom or republic of ireland to sidestep this censorship edit criticism edit censorship microsoft has been criticized for censoring bing search results to queries made in simplified chinese characters used in mainland china this is done to comply with the censorship requirements of the government in china 81 microsoft has not indicated a willingness to stop censoring search results in simplified chinese characters in the wake of google s decision to do so 82 all simplified chinese searches in bing are censored regardless of the user s country 83 edit performance issues bing has been criticized for being slower to index websites than google it has also been criticized for not indexing some websites at all 84 85 86 edit copying google s results bing has been criticized by competitor google for utilizing user input via internet explorer the bing toolbar or suggested sites to add results to bing after discovering in october 2010 that bing appeared to be imitating google s auto correct results for a misspelling despite not actually fixing the spelling of the term google set up a honeypot configuring the google search engine to return specific unrelated results for 100 nonsensical queries such as hiybbprqag 87 over the next couple of weeks google engineers entered the search term into google while using microsoft internet explorer with the bing toolbar installed and the optional suggested sites enabled in 9 out of the 100 queries bing later started returning the same results as google despite the only apparent connection between the result and search term being that google s results connected the two 88 89 microsoft s response to this issue coming from a company s spokesperson was clear we do not copy google s results bing s vice president harry shum later reiterated that the search result data google claimed that bing copied had in fact come from bing s very own users shum further wrote that we use over 1 000 different signals and features in our ranking algorithm a small piece of that is clickstream data we get from some of our customers who opt in to sharing anonymous data as they navigate the web in order to help us improve the experience for all users 90 microsoft commented that clickstream data from customers who had opted in was collected but said that it was just a small piece of over 1000 signals used in their ranking algorithm and that their intention was to learn from their collective customers they stated that bing was not intended to be a duplicate of any existing search engines 91 edit see also microsoft portal internet portal list of search engines windows live
