the world s most cited interdisciplinary scientific journal by the science edition of the 2010 journal citation reports 2 most scientific journals are now highly specialized and nature is among the few journals the other weekly journals science and proceedings of the national academy of sciences are also prominent examples that still publish original research articles across a wide range of scientific fields there are many fields of scientific research in which important new advances and original research are published as either articles or letters in nature research scientists are the primary audience for the journal but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make many of the most important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated general public towards the front of each issue are editorials news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists including current affairs science funding business scientific ethics and research breakthroughs there are also sections on books and arts the remainder of the journal consists mostly of research articles which are often dense and highly technical because of strict limits on the length of articles often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying supplementary material on the journal s website in 2007

great deal of scientific progress britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century 5 the most respected scientific journals of this time were the refereed journals of the royal society which had published many of the great works from isaac newton michael faraday through to early works from charles darwin in addition during this period the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s 6 according to the editors of these popular science magazines the publications were designed to serve as organs of science in essence a means of connecting the public to the scientific world 6 nature first created in 1869 was not the first magazine of its kind one journal to precede nature was titled recreative science a record and remembrancer of intellectual observation which created in 1859 began as a natural history magazine and progressed to include more physical observational science and technical subjects and less natural history 7 the journal s name changed from its original title to intellectual observer a review of natural history microscopic research and recreative science and then later to the student and intellectual observer of science literature and art 8 while recreative science had attempted to include more physical sciences such as astronomy and archaeology the intellectual observer broadened itself further to include literature and art as well 8 similar to recreative science was the scientific journal titled popular science review created in 1862 9 which covered different fields of science by creating subsections titled scientific summary or quarterly retrospect with book reviews and commentary on the latest scientific works and publications 9 two other journals produced in england prior to the development of nature were titled the quarterly journal of science and scientific opinion founded in 1864 and 1868 respectively 8 the journal most closely related to nature in its editorship and format was titled the reader created in 1864 the publication mixed science with literature and art in an attempt to reach an audience outside of the scientific community similar to popular science review 8 these similar journals all ultimately failed the popular science review was the longest to survive lasting 20 years and ending its publication in 1881 recreative science ceased publication as the student and intellectual observer in 1871 the quarterly journal after undergoing a number of editorial changes ceased publication in 1885 the reader terminated in 1867 and finally scientific opinion lasted a mere 2 years until june 1870 7 edit the creation of nature first title page november 4 1869 not long after the conclusion of the reader a former editor norman lockyer decided to create a new scientific journal titled nature 10 taking its name from a line by william wordsworth to the solid ground of nature trusts the mind that builds for aye 11 first owned and published by alexander macmillan nature was similar to its predecessors in its attempt to provide cultivated readers with an accessible forum for reading about advances in scientific knowledge 10 janet browne has proposed that far more than any other science journal of the period nature was conceived born and raised to serve polemic purpose 10 many of the early editions of nature consisted of articles written by members of a group that called itself the x club a group of scientists known for having liberal progressive and somewhat controversial scientific beliefs relative to the time period 10 initiated by thomas henry huxley the group consisted of such important scientists as joseph dalton hooker herbert spencer and john tyndall along with another five scientists and mathematicians these scientists were all avid supporters of darwin s theory of evolution as common descent a theory which during the latter half of the 19th century received a great deal of criticism among more conservative groups of scientists 12 perhaps it was in part its scientific liberality that made nature a longer lasting success than its predecessors john maddox editor of nature from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995 suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal s centennial edition that perhaps it was the journalistic qualities of nature that drew readers in journalism maddox states is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other this is what lockyer s journal did from the start 13 in addition maddox mentions that the financial backing of the journal in its first years by the macmillan family also allowed the journal to flourish and develop more freely than scientific journals before it 13 edit nature in the 20th and early 21st centuries nature underwent a great deal of development and expansion during the 20th century particularly during the latter half of the 90s citation needed edit editors norman lockyer the founder of nature was a professor at imperial college he was succeeded as editor in 1919 by sir richard gregory 14 gregory helped to establish nature in the international scientific community his obituary by the royal society stated gregory was always very interested in the international contacts of science and in the columns of nature he always gave generous space to accounts of the activities of the international scientific unions 15 during the years 1945 to 1973 editorship of nature changed three times first in 1945 to a j v gale and l j f brimble who in 1958 became the sole editor then to john maddox in 1965 and finally to david davies in 1973 14 in 1980 maddox returned as editor and retained his position until 1995 philip campbell has since become editor in chief of all nature publications 14 edit nature s expansion and development in 1970 nature first opened its washington office other branches opened in new york in 1985 tokyo and munich in 1987 paris in 1989 san francisco in 2001 boston in 2004 and hong kong in 2005 starting in the 1980s the journal underwent a great deal of expansion launching over ten new journals these new journals comprise the nature publishing group which was created in 1999 and includes nature nature research journals stockton press specialist journals and macmillan reference renamed npg reference in 1997 nature created its own website www nature com and in 1999 nature publishing group began its series of nature reviews 14 some articles and papers are available for free on the nature web site others require the purchase of premium access to the site nature claims a readership of about 424 000 total readers the journal has a circulation of around 53 000 but studies have concluded that on average a single copy is shared by as many as 8 people 16 on 30 october 2008 nature endorsed an american presidential candidate for the first time when it supported barack obama during his campaign in america s 2008 presidential election 17 18 edit publishing in nature this section may require cleanup to meet wikipedia s quality standards the specific problem is the content of this section appears to need in line citations from independent reliable sources please help improve this section if you can july 2011 having an article published in nature is very prestigious and the articles are often highly cited which can lead to promotions grant funding and attention from the mainstream media because of these positive feedback effects competition among scientists to publish in high level journals like nature and its closest competitor science can be very fierce nature s impact factor a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works was 36 280 in 2011 as measured by thomson isi among the highest of any science journal as with most other professional scientific journals articles undergo an initial screening by the editor followed by peer review in which other scientists chosen by the editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review will read and critique articles before publication in the case of nature they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground breaking in that particular field as a consequence the majority of submitted articles are rejected without review according to nature s original mission statement it is intended first to place before the general public the grand results of scientific work and scientific discovery and to urge the claims of science to a more general recognition in education and in daily life and secondly to aid scientific men themselves by giving early information of all advances made in any branch of natural knowledge throughout the world and by affording them an opportunity of discussing the various scientific questions which arise from time to time 20 160 20 this was revised in 2000 to first to serve scientists through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of science and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning science second to ensure that the results of science are rapidly disseminated to the public throughout the world in a fashion that conveys their significance for knowledge culture and daily life 20 160 20 edit landmark

sch n were published in nature in the 2000 2001 period the papers about superconductivity were revealed to contain falsified data and other scientific fraud in 2003 the papers were retracted by nature the sch n scandal was not limited to nature other prominent journals such as science and physical review also retracted sch n s papers 19 before publishing one of its most famous discoveries watson and crick s 1953 paper on the structure of dna nature did not send the paper out for peer review at all john maddox nature s editor stated that the watson and crick paper was not peer reviewed by nature the paper could not have been refereed its correctness is self evident no referee working in the field could have kept his mouth shut once he saw the structure 20 an earlier error occurred when enrico fermi submitted his breakthrough paper on the weak interaction theory of beta decay nature turned down the paper because it was considered too remote from reality 21 fermi s paper was published by zeitschrift f r physik in 1934 22 and finally published by nature 5 years later citation needed after fermi s work had been widely accepted when paul lauterbur and peter mansfield won a nobel prize in physiology or medicine for research initially rejected by nature and published only after lauterbur appealed the rejection nature acknowledged more of its own missteps in rejecting papers in an editorial titled coping with peer rejection t here are unarguable faux pas in our history these include the rejection of cerenkov radiation hideki yukawa s meson work on photosynthesis by johann deisenhofer robert huber and hartmut michel and the initial rejection but eventual acceptance of stephen hawking s black hole radiation 23 edit science fiction in 1999 nature began publishing science
