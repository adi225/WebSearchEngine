reading edit history the concern with the problem of finding relevant information dates back at least to the first publication of scientific journals in 17th century the formal study of relevance began in the 20th century with the study of what would later be called bibliometrics in the 1930s and 1940s s c bradford used the term relevant to characterize articles relevant to a subject cf bradford s law in the 1950s the first information retrieval systems emerged and researchers noted the retrieval of irrelevant articles as a significant concern in 1958 b c vickery made the concept of relevance explicit in an address at the international conference on scientific information 1 since 1958 information scientists have explored and debated definitions of relevance a particular focus of the debate was the distinction between relevance to a subject or topical relevance and user relevance recently zhao and callan 2010 2 showed a connection between the relevance probability and the vocabulary mismatch problem in retrieval which could lead to at least 50 300 gains in retrieval accuracy 3 edit evaluation the information retrieval community has emphasized the use of test collections and benchmark tasks to measure topical relevance starting with the cranfield experiments of the early 1960s and culminating in the trec evaluations that continue to this day as the main evaluation framework for information retrieval research in order to evaluate how well an information retrieval system retrieved topically relevant results the relevance of retrieved results must be quantified in cranfield style evaluations this typically involves assigning a relevance level to each retrieved result a process known as relevance assessment relevance levels can be binary indicating a result is relevant or that it is not relevant or graded indicating results have a varying degree of match between the topic of the result and the information need once relevance levels have been assigned to the retrieved results information retrieval performance measures can be used to assess the quality of a retrieval system s output in contrast to this focus solely on topical relevance the information science community has emphasized user studies that consider user relevance these studies often focus on aspects of human computer interaction see also human computer information retrieval edit clustering and relevance the cluster hypothesis proposed by c j van rijsbergen in 1979 asserts that two documents that are similar to each other have a high likelihood of being relevant to the same information need with respect to the embedding similarity space the cluster hypothesis can be interpreted globally or locally 4 the global interpretation assumes that there exist some fixed set of underlying topics derived from inter document similarity these global clusters or their representatives can then be used to relate relevance of two documents e g two documents in the same cluster should both be relevant to the same request methods in this spirit include cluster based information retrieval 5 6 cluster based document expansion such as latent semantic analysis or its language modeling equivalents 7 it is important to ensure that clusters either in isolation or combination successfully model the set of possible relevant documents a second interpretation most notably advanced by ellen voorhees 8 focuses on the local relationships between documents the local interpretation avoids having to model the number or size of clusters in the collection and allow relevance at multiple scales methods in this spirit include multiple cluster retrieval 6 8 spreading activation 9 and relevance propagation 10 methods local document expansion 11 score regularization 12 local methods require an accurate and appropriate document similarity measure edit epistemological issues are users best at evaluating the relevance of a given document or is it better to use experts most research about relevance in information retrieval in recent years have implicitly assumed that the users evaluation of the output a given system should be used to increase relevance output an alternative strategy would be to use journal impact factor to rank output and thus base relevance on expert evaluations other strategies such as including diversity of the search results may be used as well the important thing to recognize is however that relevance is fundamentally a question of epistemology not psychology peoples psychology reflects certain epistemological influences edit
