this article is about decision trees in decision analysis for the use of the term in machine learning see decision tree learning traditionally decision trees have been created manually a decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences including chance event outcomes resource costs and utility it is one way to display an algorithm decision trees are commonly used in operations research specifically in decision analysis to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal contents 1 overview 2 decision tree building

expected values or expected utility of competing alternatives are calculated a decision tree consists of 3 types of nodes decision nodes commonly represented by squares chance nodes represented by circles end nodes represented by triangles decision trees are commonly used in operations research specifically in decision analysis to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal if in practice decisions have to be taken online with no recall under incomplete knowledge a decision tree should be paralleled by a probability model as a best choice model or online selection model algorithm another use of decision trees is as a descriptive means for calculating conditional probabilities decision trees influence diagrams utility functions and other decision analysis tools and methods are taught to undergraduate students in schools of business health economics and public health and are examples of operations research or management science methods edit decision tree building blocks edit decision tree elements drawn from left to right a decision tree has only burst nodes splitting paths but no sink nodes converging paths therefore used manually they can grow very big and are then often hard to draw fully by hand traditionally decision trees have been created manually as the aside example shows although increasingly specialized software is employed edit decision tree using flow chart symbols commonly a decision tree is drawn using flow chart symbols as it is easier for many to read and understand edit analysis example analysis can take into account the decision maker s e g the company s preference or utility function for example the basic interpretation in this situation is that the company prefers b s risk and payoffs under realistic risk preference coefficients greater than 400k in that range of risk aversion the company would need to model a third strategy neither a nor b edit another example decision trees can be used to optimize an investment portfolio the following example shows a portfolio of 7 investment options projects the organization has 10 000 000 available for the total investment bold lines mark the best selection 1 3 5 6 and 7 which will cost 9 750 000 and create a payoff of 16 175 000 all other combinations would either exceed the budget or yield a lower payoff 1 edit influence diagram a decision tree can be represented more compactly as an influence diagram focusing attention on the issues and relationships between events the squares represent decisions the ovals represent action and the diamond represents results edit advantages and disadvantages amongst decision support tools decision trees and influence diagrams have several advantages decision trees are simple to understand and interpret people are able to understand decision tree models after a brief explanation have value even with little hard data important insights can be generated based on experts describing a situation its alternatives probabilities and costs and their preferences for outcomes possible scenarios can be added worst best and expected values can be determined for different scenarios use a white box model if a given result is provided by a model can be combined with other decision techniques the following example uses net present value calculations pert 3 point estimations decision 1 and a linear distribution of expected outcomes decision 2 disadvantages of decision trees for data including categorical variables with different number of levels information gain in decision trees are biased in favor of those attributes with more levels 2 calculations can get very complex particularly if many values are uncertain and or if many outcomes are linked edit see also decision tables decision tree complexity
