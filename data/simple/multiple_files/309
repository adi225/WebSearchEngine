joseph carl robnett licklider march 11 1915 june 26 1990 known simply as j c r or lick was an american computer scientist considered one of the most important figures in computer science and general computing history he is particularly remembered for being one of the first to foresee modern style interactive computing and its application to all manner of activities and also as an internet pioneer with an early vision of a world wide computer network long before it was built he did much to actually initiate all that through his funding of research which led to a great deal of it including today s canonical graphical user interface and the arpanet the direct predecessor to the internet he has been called computing s johnny appleseed for having planted the seeds of computing in the digital age robert taylor founder of xerox parc s computer science laboratory and digital equipment corporation s systems research center noted that most of the significant advances in computer technology including the work that my group did at xerox parc were simply extrapolations of lick s vision they were not really new visions of their own so he was really the father of it all 1 for people who only know today s computerized information rich world the change from what came before and thus his impact on the world since his ideas and the work of people he sponsored has led directly and indirectly to much of it is probably hard to truly fathom this quotation from the full length biography of him the dream machine gives some sense of it more than a decade will pass before personal computers emerge from the garages of silicon valley and a full thirty years before the internet explosion of the 1990s the word computer still has an ominous tone conjuring up the image of a huge intimidating device hidden away in an overlit air conditioned basement relentlessly processing punch cards for some large institution them yet sitting in a non descript office in mcnamara s pentagon a quiet civilian is already planning the revolution that will change forever the way computers are perceived somehow the occupant of that office has seen a future in which computers will empower individuals instead of forcing them into rigid conformity he is almost alone in his conviction that computers can become not just superfast calculating machines but joyful machines tools that will serve as new media of expression inspirations to creativity and gateways to a vast world of online information 2 contents 1 biography 2 work 2 1 psychoacoustics 2 2 semi automatic ground environment 2 3

march 11 1915 in st louis missouri usa 3 he was the only child of joseph parron licklider a baptist minister and margaret robnett licklider 4 despite his father s religious background he was not religious in later life 5 he displayed early engineering talent building model airplanes he carried on with his hobby of refurbishing automobiles throughout his life he studied at washington university in st louis where he received a ba in 1937 majoring in physics mathematics and psychology and an ma in psychology in 1938 he received a phd in psychoacoustics from the university of rochester in 1942 and worked at the psycho acoustic laboratory at harvard university from 1943 to 1950 he became interested in information technology and moved to mit in 1950 as an associate professor where he served on a committee that established mit lincoln laboratory and established a psychology program for engineering students in 1957 he received the franklin v taylor award from the society of engineering psychologists in 1958 he was elected president of the acoustical society of america and in 1990 he received the commonwealth award for distinguished service 6 in 1957 he became a vice president at bolt beranek and newman inc where he bought the first production pdp 1 computer and conducted the first public demonstration of time sharing in october 1962 licklider was appointed head of the information processing techniques office ipto at arpa the united states department of defense advanced research projects agency in 1963 he was named director of behavioral sciences command amp control research at arpa in april of that year he sent a memo to his colleagues in which he outlined the early challenges presented in trying to establish a time sharing network of computers with the software of the era 7 ultimately his vision led to arpanet the precursor of today s internet in 1968 j c r licklider became director of project mac at mit and a professor in the department of electrical engineering project mac had produced the first computer time sharing system ctss and one of the first online setups with the development of multics work on which commenced in 1964 multics provided inspiration for some elements of the unix operating system developed at bell labs by ken thompson and dennis ritchie in 1970 he retired and became professor emeritus in 1985 he died in 1990 in arlington massachusetts 6 edit work edit psychoacoustics in the psychoacoustics field licklider is most remembered for his 1951 duplex theory of pitch perception presented in a paper 8 that has been cited hundreds of times 9 was reprinted in a 1979 book 10 and formed the basis for modern models of pitch perception 11 edit semi automatic ground environment a sage operator s terminal while at mit in the 1950s licklider worked on sage semi automatic ground environment a cold war project to create a computer aided air defense system the sage system included computers that collected and presented data to a human operator who then chose the appropriate response licklider worked as a human factors expert which helped convince him of the great potential for human computer interfaces 12 edit information technology licklider became interested in information technology early in his career his ideas foretold of graphical computing point and click interfaces digital libraries e commerce online banking and software that would exist on a network and migrate wherever it was needed much like vannevar bush licklider s contribution to the development of the internet consists of ideas not inventions he foresaw the need for networked computers with easy user interfaces he also did some seminal early work for the council on library resources imagining what libraries of the future might look like 13 licklider was instrumental in conceiving funding and managing the research that led to modern personal computers and the internet in 1960 his seminal paper on man computer symbiosis foreshadowed interactive computing and he went on to fund early efforts in time sharing and application development most notably the work of douglas engelbart who founded the augmentation research center at stanford research institute and created the famous on line system where the computer mouse was invented edit man computer symbiosis in man computer symbiosis licklider outlined the need for simpler interaction between computers and computer users licklider has been credited as an early pioneer of cybernetics and artificial intelligence ai 14 but unlike many ai practitioners licklider never felt that men would be replaced by computer based beings as he wrote in that article men will set the goals formulate the hypotheses determine the criteria and perform the evaluations computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking 15 edit project mac during his time as director of ipto from 1962 to 1964 he funded project mac at mit where a large mainframe computer was designed to be shared by up to 30 simultaneous users each sitting at a separate typewriter terminal he also funded similar projects at stanford university ucla uc berkeley and the system development corporation in 1964 licklider left the ipto and went to work at ibm in 1968 he went back to mit to lead project mac 12 edit global computer network licklider played a similar role in conceiving of and funding early networking research most notably the arpanet he formulated the earliest ideas of a global computer network in august 1962 at bbn in a series of memos discussing the intergalactic computer network concept these ideas contained almost everything that the internet is today including cloud computing 16 while at ipto he convinced ivan sutherland bob taylor and lawrence g roberts that an all encompassing computer network was a very important concept in 1967 licklider submitted the paper televistas looking ahead through side windows to the carnegie commission on educational television 17 this paper describes a radical departure from the broadcast model of television instead licklider advocates a two way communications network the carnegie commission led to the creation of the corporation for public broadcasting although the commission s report explains that dr licklider s paper was completed after the commission had formulated its own conclusions president johnson said at the signing of the public broadcasting act of 1967 so i think we must consider new ways to build a great network for knowledge not just a broadcast system but one that employs every means of sending and of storing information that the individual can use 18 his 1968 paper the computer as a communication device illustrates his vision of network applications and predicts the use of computer networks to support communities of common interest and collaboration without regard to location 19 edit publications
