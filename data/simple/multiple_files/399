natural language user interfaces lui are a type of computer human interface where linguistic phenomena such as verbs phrases and clauses act as ui controls for creating selecting and modifying data in software applications in interface design natural language interfaces are sought after for their speed and ease of use but most suffer the challenges to understanding wide varieties of ambiguous input 1 natural language interfaces are an active area of study in the field of natural language processing and computational linguistics an intuitive general natural language interface is one of the active goals of the semantic web text interfaces are natural to varying degrees many formal un natural programming languages incorporate idioms of natural human language likewise a traditional keyword search engine could be described as a shallow natural language user interface contents 1 overview 2 history 3 challenges 4 uses and applications 4 1 ubiquity 4 2 wolfram alpha 4 3 siri 4 4 others 5 see also

question of the form which u s state has the highest income tax conventional search engines ignore the question and instead search on the keywords state income and tax natural language search on the other hand attempts to use natural language processing to understand the nature of the question and then to search and return a subset of the web that contains the answer to the question if it works results would have a higher relevance than results from a keyword search engine from a commercial standpoint advertising on the results page could also be more relevant and could have a higher revenue potential than that of keyword search engines citation needed edit history prototype nl interfaces had already appeared in the late sixties and early seventies 2 lunar a natural language interface to a database containing chemical analyses of apollo 11 moon rocks by william a woods chat 80 transformed english questions into prolog expressions which were evaluated against the prolog database the code of chat 80 was circulated widely and formed the basis of several other experimental nl interfaces janus is also one of the few systems to support temporal questions intellect from trinzic formed by the merger of aicorp and aion bbn s parlance built on experience from the development of the rus and irus systems ibm languageaccess q amp a from symantec datatalker from natural language inc loqui from bim english wizard from linguistic technology corporation edit challenges natural language interfaces have in the past led users to anthropomorphize the computer or at least to attribute more intelligence to machines than is warranted on the part of the user this has led to unrealistic expectations of the capabilities of the system such expectations will make it difficult to learn the restrictions of the system if users attribute too much capability to it and will ultimately lead to disappointment when the system fails to perform as expected as was the case in the ai winter of the 1970s and 80s a 1995 paper titled natural language interfaces to databases an introduction describes some challenges 2 modifier attachment the request list all employees in the company with a driving licence is ambiguous unless you know companies can t have drivers licences conjunction and disjunction list all applicants who live in california and arizona is ambiguous unless you know that a person can t live in two places at once anaphora resolution resolve what a user means by he she or it in a self referential query other goals to consider more generally are the speed and efficiency of the interface in all algorithms these two points are the main point that will determine if some methods are better than others and therefore have greater success in the market finally regarding the methods used the main problem to be solved is creating a general algorithm that can recognize the entire spectrum of different voices while disregarding nationality gender or age the significant differences between the extracted features even from speakers who says the same word or phrase must be successfully overcome edit uses and applications the natural language interface and his recognition with satisfactory results give rise to this technology to be used for different uses and applications some of the main uses are dictation is the most common use for asr systems today this includes medical transcriptions legal and business dictation and general word processing in some cases special vocabularies are used to increase the accuracy of the system command and control asr systems that are designed to perform functions and actions on the system are defined as command and control systems utterances like open netscape and start a new xterm will do just that telephony some pbx voice mail systems allow callers to speak commands instead of pressing buttons to send specific tones wearables because inputs are limited for wearable devices speaking is a natural possibility medical disabilities many people have difficulty typing due to physical limitations such as repetitive strain injuries rsi muscular dystrophy and many others for example people with difficulty hearing could use a system connected to their telephone to convert a caller s speech to text embedded applications some new cellular phones include c amp c speech recognition that allow utterances such as call home this may be a major factor in the future of automatic speech recognition asr and linux below are named and defined some of the applications that use natural language recognition and so have integrated utilities listed above edit ubiquity main article ubiquity firefox ubiquity an add on for mozilla firefox is a collection of quick and easy natural language derived commands that act as mashups of web services thus allowing users to get information and relate it to current and other webpages edit wolfram alpha main article wolfram alpha wolfram alpha is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine would 3 it was announced in march 2009 by stephen wolfram and was released to the public on may 15 2009 4 edit siri main article siri software siri is a personal assistant application for the operating system ios the application uses natural language processing to answer questions and make recommendations the iphone app is the first public product by its makers who are focused on artificial intelligence applications siri s marketing claims include that it adapts to a user s individual preferences over time and personalizes results and performs tasks such as making dinner reservations while trying to catch a cab 5 edit others anboto group provides web customer service and e commerce technology based on semantics and natural language processing the main offer of anboto group are the virtual sales

under developmental stage it is being developed by one programmer named akash shastri the main goal of this project is to make computer understand the human language so that a user can control a computer without use of any commands invention machine goldfire powered by a semantic research engine that has the capability to transform unstructured documents from various electronic sources into an index that when searched delivers answers to research questions goldfire s natural language query interface enables the user to put a question in a free text format which would be the same format as if the question were given to another person and once knowledge has been retrieved goldfire presents the results in a way that makes their meaning readily apparent brainboost no longer available

semantics fuzzy logic computational linguistics and mathematics lexxe lexxe is an internet search engine that uses natural language processing for queries semantic search searches can be made with keywords phrases and questions such as how old is wikipedia when it comes to facts lexxe is quite effective though needs much improvement in natural language analysis in the area of facts and in other
