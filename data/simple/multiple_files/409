41421296 1 numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation as opposed to general symbolic manipulations for the problems of mathematical analysis as distinguished from discrete mathematics one of the earliest mathematical writings is a babylonian tablet from the yale babylonian collection ybc 7289 which gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of the length of the diagonal in a unit square being able to compute the sides of a triangle and hence being able to compute square roots is extremely important for instance in carpentry and construction 2 numerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations much like the babylonian approximation of modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice instead much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors numerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences but in the 21st 160 century the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations ordinary differential equations appear in the movement of heavenly bodies planets stars and galaxies numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis stochastic differential equations and markov chains are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology before the advent of modern computers numerical methods often depended on hand interpolation in large printed tables since the mid 20th century computers calculate the required functions instead these same interpolation formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms for solving differential equations

external links edit general introduction the overall goal of the field of numerical analysis is the design and analysis of techniques to give approximate but accurate solutions to hard problems the variety of which is suggested by the following advanced numerical methods are essential in making numerical weather prediction feasible computing the trajectory of a spacecraft requires the accurate numerical solution of a system of ordinary differential equations car companies can improve the crash safety of their vehicles by using computer simulations of car crashes such simulations essentially consist of solving partial differential equations numerically hedge funds private investment funds use tools from all fields of numerical analysis to attempt to calculate the value of stocks and derivatives more precisely than other market participants airlines use sophisticated optimization algorithms to decide ticket prices airplane and crew assignments and fuel needs historically such algorithms were developed within the overlapping field of operations research insurance companies use numerical programs for actuarial analysis the rest of this section outlines several important themes of numerical analysis edit history the field of numerical analysis predates the invention of modern computers by many centuries linear interpolation was already in use more than 2000 years ago many great mathematicians of the past were preoccupied by numerical analysis as is obvious from the names of important algorithms like newton s method lagrange interpolation polynomial gaussian elimination or euler s method to facilitate computations by hand large books were produced with formulas and tables of data such as interpolation points and function coefficients using these tables often calculated out to 16 decimal places or more for some functions one could look up values to plug into the formulas given and achieve very good numerical estimates of some functions the canonical work in the field is the nist publication edited by abramowitz and stegun a 1000 plus page book of a very large number of commonly used formulas and functions and their values at many points the function values are no longer very useful when a computer is available but the large listing of formulas can still be very handy the mechanical calculator was also developed as a tool for hand computation these calculators evolved into electronic computers in the 1940s and it was then found that these computers were also useful for administrative purposes but the invention of the computer also influenced the field of numerical analysis since now longer and more complicated calculations could be done edit direct and iterative methods direct vs iterative methods consider the problem of solving 3 x 3 4 28 for the unknown quantity x direct method 3 x 3 4 28 subtract 4 3 x 3 24 divide by 3 x 3 8 take cube roots x 2 for the iterative method apply the bisection method to f x 3 x 3 24 the initial values are a 0 b 3 f a 24 f b 57 iterative method a b mid f mid 0 3 1 5 13 875 1 5 3 2 25 10 17 1 5 2 25 1 875 4 22 1 875 2 25 2 0625 2 32 we conclude from this table that the solution is between 1 875 and 2 0625 the algorithm might return any number in that range with an error less than 0 2 edit discretization and numerical integration in a two hour race we have measured the speed of the car at three instants and recorded them in the following table time 0 20 1 00 1 40 km h 140 150 180 a discretization would be to say that the speed of the car was constant from 0 00 to 0 40 then from 0 40 to 1 20 and finally from 1 20 to 2 00 for instance the total distance traveled in the first 40 minutes is approximately 2 3h 160 160 140 160 km h 160 160 93 3 160 km this would allow us to estimate the total distance traveled as 93 3 160 km 100 160 km 120 160 km 313 3 160 km which is an example of numerical integration see below using a riemann sum because displacement is the integral of velocity ill posed problem take the function f x 1 x 160 160 1 note that f 1 1 10 and f 1 001 1000 a change in x of less than 0 1 turns into a change in f x of nearly 1000 evaluating f x near x 1 is an ill conditioned problem well posed problem by contrast the function is continuous and so evaluating it is well posed at least for x being not close to zero direct methods compute the solution to a problem in a finite number of steps these methods would give the precise answer if they were performed in infinite precision arithmetic examples include gaussian elimination the qr factorization method for solving systems of linear equations and the simplex method of linear programming in practice finite precision is used and the result is an approximation of the true solution assuming stability in contrast to direct methods iterative methods are not expected to terminate in a number of steps starting from an initial guess iterative methods form successive approximations that converge to the exact solution only in the limit a convergence test is specified in order to decide when a sufficiently accurate solution has hopefully been found even using infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution within a finite number of steps in general examples include newton s method the bisection method and jacobi iteration in computational matrix algebra iterative methods are generally needed for large problems iterative methods are more common than direct methods in numerical analysis some methods are direct in principle but are usually used as though they were not e g gmres and the conjugate gradient method for these methods the number of steps needed to obtain the exact solution is so large that an approximation is accepted in the same manner as for an iterative method edit discretization furthermore continuous problems must sometimes be replaced by a discrete problem whose solution is known to approximate that of the continuous problem this process is called discretization for example the solution of a differential equation is a function this function must be represented by a finite amount of data for instance by its value at a finite number of points at its domain even though this domain is a continuum edit generation and propagation of errors the study of errors forms an important part of numerical analysis there are several ways in which error can be introduced in the solution of the problem edit round off round off errors arise because it is impossible to represent all real numbers exactly on a machine with finite memory which is what all practical digital computers are edit truncation and discretization error truncation errors are committed when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated and the approximate solution differs from the exact solution similarly discretization induces a discretization error because the solution of the discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem for instance in the iteration in the sidebar to compute the solution of after 10 or so iterations we conclude that the root is roughly 1 99 for example we therefore have a truncation error of 0 01 once an error is generated it will generally propagate through the calculation for instance we have already noted that the operation on a calculator or a computer is inexact it follows that a calculation of the type a b c d e is even more inexact what does it mean when we say that the truncation error is created when we approximate a mathematical procedure we know that to integrate a function exactly requires one to find the sum of infinite trapezoids but numerically one can find the sum of only finite trapezoids and hence the approximation of the mathematical procedure similarly to differentiate a function the differential element approaches to zero but numerically we can only choose a finite value of the differential element edit numerical stability and well posed problems numerical stability is an important notion in numerical analysis an algorithm is called numerically stable if an error whatever its cause does not grow to be much larger during the calculation this happens if the problem is well conditioned meaning that the solution changes by only a small amount if the problem data are changed by a small amount to the contrary if a problem is ill conditioned then any small error in the data will grow to be a large error both the original problem and the algorithm used to solve that problem can be well conditioned and or ill conditioned and any combination is possible so an algorithm that solves a well conditioned problem may be either numerically stable or numerically unstable an art of numerical analysis is to find a stable algorithm for solving a well posed mathematical problem for instance computing the square root of 2 which is roughly 1 41421 is a well posed problem many algorithms solve this problem by starting with an initial approximation x 1 to for instance x 1 1 4 and then computing improved guesses x 2 x 3 etc one such method is the famous babylonian method which is given by x k 1 x k 2 1 x k another iteration which we will call method x is given by x k 1 x k 2 2 2 x k 3 we have calculated a few iterations of each scheme in table form below with initial guesses x 1 1 4 and x 1 1 42 babylonian babylonian method x method x x 1 1 4 x 1 1 42 x 1 1 4 x 1 1 42 x 2 1 4142857 x 2 1 41422535 x 2 1 4016 x 2 1 42026896 x 3 1 414213564 x 3 1 41421356242 x 3 1 4028614 x 3 1 42056 x 1000000 1 41421 x 28 7280 2284 observe that the babylonian method converges fast regardless of the initial guess whereas method x converges extremely slowly with initial guess 1 4 and diverges for initial guess 1 42 hence the babylonian method is numerically stable while method x is numerically unstable numerical stability is affected by the number of the significant digits the machine keeps on if we use a machine that keeps on the first four floating point digits a good example on loss of significance is given by these two equivalent functions if we compare the results of and by looking to the two above results we realize that loss of significance which is also called subtractive cancelation has a huge effect on the results even though both functions are equivalent to show that they are equivalent simply we need to start by f x and end with g x and so the true value for the result is 11 174755 which is exactly g 500 11 1748 after rounding the result to 4 decimal digits now imagine that lots of terms like these functions are used in the program the error will increase as one proceeds in the program unless one uses the suitable formula of the two functions each time one evaluates either f x or g x the choice is dependent on the parity of 160 x the example is taken from mathew numerical methods using matlab 3rd ed edit areas of study the field of numerical analysis is divided into different disciplines according to the problem that is to be solved edit computing values of functions interpolation we have observed the temperature to vary from 20 degrees celsius at 1 00 to 14 degrees at 3 00 a linear interpolation of this data would conclude that it was 17 degrees at 2 00 and 18 5 degrees at 1 30pm extrapolation if the gross domestic product of a country has been growing an average of 5 per year and was 100 billion dollars last year we might extrapolate that it will be 105 billion dollars this year regression in linear regression given n points we compute a line that passes as close as possible to those n points optimization say you sell lemonade at a lemonade stand and notice that at 1 you can sell 197 glasses of lemonade per day and that for each increase of 0 01 you will sell one glass of lemonade less per day if you could charge 1 485 you would maximize your profit but due to the constraint of having to charge a whole cent amount charging 1 49 per glass will yield the maximum income of 220 52 per day differential equation if you set up 100 fans to blow air from one end of the room to the other and then you drop a feather into the wind what happens the feather will follow the air currents which may be very complex one approximation is to measure the speed at which the air is blowing near the feather every second and advance the simulated feather as if it were moving in a straight line at that same speed for one second before measuring the wind speed again this is called the euler method for solving an ordinary differential equation one of the simplest problems is the evaluation of a function at a given point the most straightforward approach of just plugging in the number in the formula is sometimes not very efficient for polynomials a better approach is using the horner scheme since it reduces the necessary number of multiplications and additions generally it is important to estimate and control round off errors arising from the use of floating point arithmetic edit interpolation extrapolation and regression interpolation solves the following problem given the value of some unknown function at a number of points what value does that function have at some other point between the given points extrapolation is very similar to interpolation except that now we want to find the value of the unknown function at a point which is outside the given points regression is also similar but it takes into account that the data is imprecise given some points and a measurement of the value of some function at these points with an error we want to determine the unknown function the least squares method is one popular way to achieve this edit solving equations and systems of equations another fundamental problem is computing the solution of some given equation two cases are commonly distinguished depending on whether the equation is linear or not for instance the equation is linear while is not much effort has been put in the development of methods for solving systems of linear equations standard direct methods i e methods that use some matrix decomposition are gaussian elimination lu decomposition cholesky decomposition for symmetric or hermitian and positive definite matrix and qr decomposition for non square matrices iterative methods such as the jacobi method gauss seidel method successive over relaxation and conjugate gradient method are usually preferred for large systems general iterative methods can be developed using a matrix splitting root finding algorithms are used to solve nonlinear equations they are so named since a root of a function is an argument for which the function yields zero if the function is differentiable and the derivative is known then newton s method is a popular choice linearization is another technique for solving nonlinear equations edit solving eigenvalue or singular value problems several important problems can be phrased in terms of eigenvalue decompositions or singular value decompositions for instance the spectral image compression algorithm 4 is based on the singular value decomposition the corresponding tool in statistics is called principal component analysis edit optimization main article mathematical optimization optimization problems ask for the point at which a given function is maximized or minimized often the point also has to satisfy some constraints the field of optimization is further split in several subfields depending on the form of the objective function and the constraint for instance linear programming deals with the case that both the objective function and the constraints are linear a famous method in linear programming is the simplex method the method of lagrange multipliers can be used to reduce optimization problems with constraints to unconstrained optimization problems edit evaluating integrals main article numerical integration numerical integration in some instances also known as numerical quadrature asks for the value of a definite integral popular methods use one of the newton cotes formulas like the midpoint rule or simpson s rule or gaussian quadrature these methods rely on a divide and conquer strategy whereby an integral on a relatively large set is broken down into integrals on smaller sets in higher dimensions where these methods become prohibitively expensive in terms of computational effort one may use monte carlo or quasi monte carlo methods see monte carlo integration or in modestly large dimensions the method of sparse grids edit differential equations main articles numerical ordinary differential equations and numerical partial differential equations numerical analysis is also concerned with computing in an approximate way the solution of differential equations both ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations partial differential equations are solved by first discretizing the equation bringing it into a finite dimensional subspace this can be done by a finite element method a finite difference method or particularly in engineering a finite volume method the theoretical justification of these methods often involves theorems from functional analysis this reduces the problem to the solution of an algebraic equation edit software main articles list of numerical analysis software and comparison of numerical analysis software since the late twentieth century most algorithms are implemented in a variety of programming languages the netlib repository contains various collections of software routines for numerical problems mostly in fortran and c commercial products implementing many different numerical algorithms include the imsl and nag libraries a free alternative is the gnu scientific library there are several popular numerical computing applications such as matlab s plus labview and idl as well as free and open source alternatives such as freemat scilab gnu octave similar to matlab it a c library r similar to s plus and certain variants of python performance varies widely while vector and matrix operations are usually fast scalar loops may vary in speed by more than an order of magnitude 5 6 many computer algebra systems such as mathematica also benefit from the availability of arbitrary precision arithmetic which can provide more accurate results also any spreadsheet software can be used to solve simple problems relating to numerical analysis edit see also scientific computing list of numerical analysis topics gram schmidt process numerical differentiation symbolic numeric computation
