the acm computing classification system is a subject classification system for computer science devised by the association for computing machinery the system is comparable to the mathematics subject classification in scope aims and structure being used by the various acm journals to organise subjects by area contents 1 history 2 structure 3 see also 4 references 5 external links edit history the system has gone through seven revisions the first version being published in 1964 and revised versions appearing in 1982 1983 1987 1991 1998 and the now current version in 2012 edit structure the acm computing classification system version 2012 has a revolutionary change in some areas for example in software that now is called software and its engineering which has three main subjects software organization and properties this subject addresses the programming language theory and in a broad sense what software is software notations and tools this subject classify some practical concerns about software development software creation and management this subject is which we know traditionally as software engineering se but se as category as missed the acm computing classification system version 1998 is hierarchically structured in four levels three outer levels coded by capital letters and numbers and an uncoded fourth level of subject descriptors thus for example one branch of the hierarchy contains i computing methodologies which contains i 2 artificial intelligence which contains i 2 4 knowledge representation formalisms and methods which contains temporal logic each top level category has two standard subcategories general coded with a 0 and miscellaneous coded with a m for instance i 0 denotes the general subcategory of computing methodologies while i m denotes its miscellaneous subcategory several subtopics are listed as uncoded subject descriptors in these standard subcategories v t e acm computing classification system the 1998 version of the acm classification has the following main categories a general literature is for general computing literature it includes subtopics for introductory and survey material and for reference works b hardware has subtopics for control structures and microprogramming arithmetic and logic structures memory structures input output and data communications register transfer level implementation logic design integrated circuits and performance and reliability c computer systems organization concerns computer systems organization the subtopics of this section are processor architectures computer communication networks special purpose and application based systems performance of systems and computer system implementation d software this section includes two subtopics on software development programming techniques and software engineering two more subtopics concern the software infrastructure needed to run other software programming languages and operating systems e data includes subtopics on data structures data storage representations data encryption coding and information theory and files f theory of computation includes several topics from the theory of computation computation by abstract devices analysis of algorithms and problem complexity logics and meanings of programs mathematical logic and formal languages g mathematics of computing its subtopics are numerical analysis discrete mathematics probability and statistics and mathematical software h information systems it includes subtopics for models and principles database management information storage and retrieval information systems applications and information interfaces and presentation e g hci i computing methodologies covers a diverse set of subtopics concerning different application areas of computation symbolic and algebraic manipulation artificial intelligence computer graphics image processing and computer vision pattern recognition simulation and modeling and document and text processing j computer applications also covers computer applications but with a focus more on the different application areas and less on the different styles of computation one does in each of those areas its subtopics are administrative data processing physical sciences and engineering life and medical sciences social and behavioral sciences arts and humanities computer aided engineering and computers in other systems k computing milieux the subtopics of this section are the computer industry history of computing computers and education computers and society legal aspects of computing management of computing and information systems the computing profession and personal computing edit see also computer science portal arxiv a preprint server that uses a somewhat different subdivision of topics in its computer science subject areas but also allows papers to be classified using the acm system edit references coulter neal 1997 acm s computing classification system reflects changing

1998 3 and the current 2012 version 4 the acm computing research repository uses a classification scheme that is much coarser than the acm subject classification and does not cover all areas of cs but is intended to better cover active areas of research in addition papers in this repository are classified according to the acm subject classification this computer science article is a stub you can
