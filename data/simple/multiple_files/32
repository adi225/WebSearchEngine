another article please see discussion on the linked talk page please do not remove this message until the contradictions are resolved january 2012 artificial life often abbreviated alife or a life 1 is a field of study and an associated art form which examine systems related to life its processes and its evolution through the use of simulations with computer models robotics and biochemistry 2 the discipline was named by christopher langton an american computer scientist in 1986 3 there are three main kinds of alife 4 named for their approaches soft 5 from software hard 6 from hardware and wet from biochemistry artificial life imitates traditional biology by trying to recreate some aspects of biological phenomena 7 the term artificial intelligence is often used to specifically refer to soft

external links edit overview artificial life studies the logic of living systems in artificial environments in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex information processing that defines such systems also sometimes included in the umbrella term artificial life are agent based systems which are used to study the emergent properties of societies of agents while life is by definition alive artificial life is generally referred to as being confined to a digital environment and existence edit philosophy the modeling philosophy of alife strongly differs from traditional modeling by studying not only life as we know it but also life as it might be 9 a traditional model of a biological system will focus on capturing its most important parameters in contrast an alife modeling approach will generally seek to decipher the most simple and general principles underlying life and implement them in a simulation the simulation then offers the possibility to analyse new and different lifelike systems red ko proposed to generalize this distinction to the modeling of any process leading to the more general distinction of processes as we know them and processes as they could be 10 at present the commonly accepted definition of life does not consider any current alife simulations or softwares to be alive and they do not constitute part of the evolutionary process of any ecosystem however different opinions about artificial life s potential have arisen the strong alife cf strong ai position states that life is a process which can be abstracted away from any particular medium john von neumann notably tom ray declared that his program tierra is not simulating life in a computer but synthesizing it citation needed the weak alife position denies the possibility of generating a living process outside of a chemical solution its researchers try instead to simulate life processes to understand the underlying mechanics of biological phenomena edit organizations main article artificial life organizations edit software based soft edit techniques cellular automata were used in the early days of artificial life and are still often used for ease of scalability and parallelization alife and cellular automata share a closely tied history neural networks are sometimes used to model the brain of an agent although traditionally more of an artificial intelligence technique neural nets can be important for simulating population dynamics of organisms that can learn the symbiosis between learning and evolution is central to theories about the development of instincts in organisms with higher neurological complexity as in for instance the baldwin effect edit notable simulators this is a list of artificial life digital organism simulators

of a computer program than actual biological dna assembly derivatives are the most common languages used an organism lives when its code is executed and there are usually various methods allowing self replication mutations are generally implemented as random changes to the code use of cellular automata is common but not required edit module based individual modules are added to a creature these modules modify the creature s behaviors and characteristics either directly by hard coding into the simulation leg type a increases speed and metabolism or indirectly through the emergent interactions between a creature s modules leg type a moves up and down with a frequency of x which interacts with other legs to create motion generally these are simulators which emphasize user creation and accessibility over mutation and evolution edit parameter based organisms are generally constructed with pre defined and fixed behaviors that are controlled by various parameters that mutate that is each organism contains a collection of numbers or other finite parameters each parameter controls one or several aspects of an organism in a well defined way edit neural net based these simulations have creatures that learn and grow using neural nets or a close derivative emphasis is often although not always more on learning than on natural selection edit hardware based hard further information robot hardware based artificial life mainly consist of robots that is automatically guided machines able to do tasks on their own edit biochemical based wet further information synthetic life 160 and 160 synthetic biology biochemical based life is studied in the field of synthetic biology it involves e g the creation of synthetic dna the term wet is an extension of the term wetware edit related subjects artificial intelligence has traditionally used a top down approach while alife generally works from the bottom up 11 artificial chemistry started as a method within the alife community to abstract the processes of chemical reactions evolutionary algorithms are a practical application of the weak alife principle applied to optimization problems many optimization algorithms have been crafted which borrow from or closely mirror alife techniques the primary difference lies in explicitly defining the fitness of an agent by its ability to solve a problem instead of its ability to find food reproduce or avoid death citation needed the following is a list of evolutionary algorithms closely related to and used in alife ant colony optimization evolutionary algorithm genetic algorithm genetic programming swarm intelligence evolutionary art uses techniques and methods from artificial life to create new forms of art evolutionary music uses similar techniques but applied to music instead of visual art abiogenesis and the origin of life sometimes employ alife methodologies as well edit history main article history of artificial life edit criticism alife has had a controversial history john maynard smith criticized certain artificial life work in 1994 as fact free science 12 however the recent publication of artificial life articles in widely read journals such as science and nature is evidence that artificial life techniques are becoming more accepted in the mainstream at least as a method of studying evolution 13 edit see also applications of artificial intelligence
