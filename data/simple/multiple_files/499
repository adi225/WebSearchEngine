sas is driven by sas programs which define a sequence of operations to be performed on data stored as tables although non programmer graphical user interfaces to sas exist such as the sas enterprise guide these guis are most often merely a front end that automates or facilitates the generation of sas programs the functionalities of sas components are intended to be accessed via application programming interfaces in the form of statements and procedures a sas program has four major parts the data step procedure steps effectively everything that is not enclosed in a data step a macro language a metaprogramming language ods output delivery system statements which direct any output or data sets created by data or procedure steps to any of various file types and apply styles and templates to the output sas library engines and remote library services allow access to data stored in external data structures and on remote computer platforms the data step section of a sas program 1 like other database oriented fourth generation programming languages such as sql or focus assumes a default file structure and by default automates the process of identifying files to the operating system opening the input file reading the next record opening the output file writing the next record and closing the files this allows the user programmer to concentrate on the details of working with the data within each record in effect working almost entirely within an implicit program loop that runs for each record any aspect of these automated functionalities may also be modified within the data step all other tasks are accomplished by procedures that operate on the data set sas terminology for table as a whole typical tasks include printing or performing statistical analysis and may just require the user programmer to identify the data set procedures are not restricted to only one behavior and thus allow extensive customization controlled by mini languages defined within the procedures sas also has an extensive sql procedure allowing sql programmers to use the system with little additional knowledge there are macro programming extensions that allow for rationalization of repetitive sections of the program proper imperative and procedural programming constructs can be simulated by use of the open code macros or the interactive matrix language sas iml component macro code in a sas program if any undergoes preprocessing at run time data steps are compiled and procedures are interpreted and run in the sequence they appear in the sas program a sas program requires the sas software to run compared to general purpose programming languages this structure allows the user programmer to concentrate less on the technical details of the data and how it is stored and more on the information contained in the data this blurs the line between user and programmer appealing to individuals who fall more into the business or research area and less in the information technology area since sas does not enforce although it recommends a structured centralized approach to data and infrastructure management sas runs on ibm mainframes unix linux openvms alpha and microsoft windows code is almost transparently moved between these environments older versions have supported pc dos the apple macintosh vms vm cms primeos data general aos and os 2 edit code example

graduate student from 1962 to 1964 barr had created an analysis of variance modeling language inspired by the notation of statistician maurice kendall followed by a multiple regression program that generated machine code for performing algebraic transformations of the raw data drawing on those programs and his experience with structured data files 3 he created sas placing statistical procedures into a formatted file framework from 1966 to 1968 barr developed the fundamental structure and language of sas in january 1968 barr and jim goodnight collaborated integrating new multiple regression and analysis of variance routines developed by goodnight into barr s framework 4 5 goodnight s routines made the handling of basic statistical analysis more robust and his later implementation in sas 76 of the general linear model increased the analytical power of the system citation needed by 1971 sas was gaining popularity within the academic community one strength of the system was analyzing experiments with missing data which was useful to the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries among others in 1973 john sall joined the project making extensive programming contributions in econometrics time series and matrix algebra other participants in the early years included caroll g perkins jolayne w service and jane t helwig perkins made programming contributions service and helwig created the early documentation 4 in 1976 sas institute inc was incorporated by barr goodnight sall and helwig sas sued world programming the developers of a competing implementation world programming system alleging that they had infringed sas s copyright in part by implementing the same functionality this case was referred from the united kingdom s high court of justice to the european court of justice on 11 august 2010 6 in may 2012 the european court of justice ruled in favor of world programming finding that the functionality of a computer program and the programming language cannot be protected by copyright 7 edit versions sas 71 sas 71 represents the first limited release of the system the first manual for sas was printed at this time approximately 60 pages long 8 the data step was implemented regression and analysis of variance were the main uses of the program sas 72 this more robust release was the first to achieve wide distribution it included a substantial user s guide 260 pages in length 9 the merge statement was introduced in this release adding the ability to perform a database join on two data sets 10 this release also introduced the comprehensive handling of missing data 11 sas 76 sas 76 was a complete system level rewrite featuring an open architecture for adding and extending procedures and for extending the compiler 12 the input and infile statements were significantly enhanced to read virtually all data formats in use on the ibm mainframe 13 report generation was added through the put and file statements 14 the capacity to analyze general linear models was added 15 79 3 82 4 1980 saw the addition of sas graph a graphing component and sas ets for econometric and time series analysis in 1981 sas fsp followed providing full screen interactive data entry editing browsing retrieval and letter writing in 1983 full screen spreadsheet capabilities were introduced proc fscalc for ibm mainframes sas 82 no longer required sas databases to have direct access organization dsorg dau because sas 82 removed location dependent information from databases this permitted sas to work with datasets on tape and other media besides disk version 4 series in the early 1980s sas institute released version 4 the first version for non ibm computers it was written mostly in a subset of the pl i language to run on several minicomputer manufacturers operating systems and hardware data general s aos vs digital equipment s vax vms and prime computer s primos the version was colloquially called portable sas because most of the code was portable i e the same code would run under different operating systems version 6 series version 6 represented a major milestone for sas while it appeared superficially similar to the user major changes occurred under the hood the software was rewritten from its fortran origins followed by pl i and mainframe assembly language in version 6 sas was rewritten in c to provide enhanced portability between operating systems as well as access to an increasing pool of c programmers compared to the shrinking pool of pl i programmers this was the first version to run on unix ms dos and windows platforms the dos versions were incomplete implementations of the version 6 spec some functions and formats were unavailable as were sql and related items such as indexing and where subsetting dos memory limitations restricted the size of some user defined items the mainframe version of sas 6 changed the physical format of sas databases from direct files dsorg da to standard blocked physical sequential files dsorg ps recfm fs with a customized excp macro instead of bsam qsam or previously bdam which was used through version 5 until the complete rewrite of version 6 the practical benefit of this change is that a sas 6 database can be copied from any media with any copying tool including iebgener which uses bsam in 1984 a project management component was added sas project in 1985 sas af software econometrics and time series analysis sas ets component and interactive matrix programming sas iml software was introduced ms dos sas version 6 02 was introduced along with a link to mainframe sas in 1986 statistical quality improvement component is added sas qc software sas iml and sas stat software is released for personal computers 1987 saw concurrent update access provided for sas data sets with sas share software database interfaces are introduced for db2 and sql ds in 1988 sas introduced the concept of multivendor architecture mva sas access software is released support for unix based hardware announced sas assist software for building user friendly front end menus is introduced new sas cpe software establishes sas as innovator in computer performance evaluation version 6 03 for ms dos is released 6 06 for mvs cms and openvms is announced in 1990 the same year the last ms dos version 6 04 is released data visualization capabilities added in 1991 with sas insight software in 1992 sas calc sas toolkit sas ph clinical and sas lab software is released in 1993 software for building customized executive information systems eis is introduced release 6 08 for mvs cms vms vse os 2 and windows is announced 1994 saw the addition of odbc support plus sas spectraview and sas share net components 6 09 saw the addition of a data step debugger 6 09e for mvs 6 10 in 1995 was a microsoft windows release and the first release for the apple macintosh version 6 was the first and last series to run on the macintosh jmp also produced by the sas institute is the software package the company produces for the macintosh also in 1995 6 11 codenamed orlando was released for windows 95 windows nt and unix in 1996 sas announces web enablement of sas software and introduced the scalable performance data server in 1997 sas warehouse administrator and sas intrnet software goes into production 1998 sees sas introduce a customer relationship management crm solution and an erp access interface sas access interface for sap r 3 sas is also the first to release ole db for olap and releases holap solution balanced scorecard sas enterprise reporter and hr vision are released first release of sas enterprise miner 1999 sees the releases of hr vision software the first end to end decision support system for human resources reporting and analysis and risk dimensions software an end to end risk management solution ms dos versions are abandoned because of y2k issues and lack of continued demand in 2000 sas shipped enterprise guide and ported its software to linux version 7 series the output delivery system debuted in version 7 as did long variable names from 8 to 32 characters storage of long character strings in variables from 200 to 32 767 and a much improved built in text editor the enhanced editor version 7 saw the synchronisation of features between the various platforms for a particular version number which previously hadn t been the case version 7 foreshadowed version 8 it was believed in the sas users community although never officially confirmed that in releasing version 7 sas institute released a snapshot from their development on version 8 to meet a deadline promise to some sas institute recommending that sites wait until version 8 before deploying the new software was a confirmation of this version 8 series released about 1999 8 0 8 1 8 2 were unix linux microsoft windows cms z vm and z os releases key features long variable names output delivery system ods sas 8 1 was released in 2000 sas 8 2 was released in 2001 version 9 series version 9 makes additions to base sas the new hash object now allows functionality similar to the merge statement without sorting data or building formats the function library was enlarged and many functions have new parameters perl regular expressions are now supported as opposed to the old regular expression facility which was incompatible with most other implementations of regular expressions long format names are now supported sas 9 2 released in march 2008 and was demonstrated at sas global forum previously called sugi 2008 16 the new features are listed in the what s new in sas web page 17 sas 9 2 was released incrementally in three phases 18 mva based products e g sas base sas stat sas graph nothing that relies on metadata limited availability from march 2008 because most users rely on the metadata server see phase 2 or products released in phased 3 enterprise intelligence platform metadata server for business intelligence bi and data integration availability from march 2009 client software for metadata driven analytics and business solutions enterprise miner text miner model manager solutions include financial retail health amp life science probably released in 2nd quarter 2009 sas 9 3 was released july 2011 and was followed by a service release in december 2011 19 edit market share sas is the largest alongside microstrategy independent vendor in the business intelligence market sector conglomerate companies including sap businessobjects ibm cognos spss modeler oracle hyperion and microsoft bi have also entered the market to compete against independent vendors via industry acquisitions 20 gartner an independent market analyses firm placed sas in the leaders quadrant of their 2010 bi magic quadrant 21 edit components sas consists of a number of components which organizations separately license and install as required base sas the core of sas base sas software manages data and calls procedures sas procedures software analyzes and reports the data the sql procedure allows sql structured query language programming in lieu of data step and procedure programming library engines allow transparent access to common data structures such as oracle as well as pass through of sql to be executed by such data structures the macro facility is a tool for extending and customizing sas software programs and reducing overall

look at all the underlying data data integration studio provides extract transform load etl services sas enterprise business intelligence server includes both a suite of business intelligence bi tools and a platform to provide uniform access to data the goal of this product is to compete with business objects and cognos offerings enterprise computing offer eco not to be confused with enterprise guide or enterprise miner eco is a product bundle enterprise guide sas enterprise guide is a microsoft windows client application that provides a guided mechanism to use sas and publish dynamic results throughout an organization in a uniform way it is marketed as the default interface to sas for business analysts statisticians and programmers though data integration studio is the true etl tool of sas enterprise guide can be used for the etl of smaller projects enterprise miner a data mining tool information delivery portal allows users to set up personalized homepages where they can view automatically generated reports dashboards and other sas data structures information map studio a client application that helps with building information maps olap cube studio a client application that helps with building olap cubes sas web olap viewer for java web based application for viewing olap cubes and data explorations discontinued as per nov 2010 22 sas web olap viewer for net sas access provides the ability for sas to transparently share data with non native datasources sas access for pc files allows sas to transparently share data with personal computer applications including ms access and microsoft office excel sas add in for microsoft office a component of the sas enterprise business intelligence server is designed to provide access to data analysis reporting and analytics for non technical workers such as business analysts power users domain experts and decision makers via menus and toolbars integrated into office applications sas af applications facility a set of application development tools to create customized desktop gui applications a library of drag and drop widgets are available widgets and models are fully object oriented scl programs can be attached as needed sas scl sas component language allows programmers to create and compile object oriented programs uniquely sas allows objects to submit and execute base sas and sas macro statements sas assist early point and click interface to sas has since been superseded by sas enterprise guide and its client server architecture sas c sas calc is a discontinued spreadsheet application which came out in version 6 for mainframes and pcs and didn t make it further sas connect provides ability for sas sessions on different platforms to communicate with each other sas dmi a programming interface between interactive sas and ispf pdf applications obsolete since version 5 sas eis a menu driven system for developing running and maintaining an enterprise information systems sas ets provides econometrics and time series analysis sas fsp allows interaction with data using integrated tools for data entry computation query editing validation display and retrieval sas gis an interactive desktop geographic information system for mapping applications sas graph although base sas includes primitive graphing capabilities sas graph is needed for charting on graphical media sas iml matrix handling sas script extensions sas insight dynamic tool for data mining allows examination of univariate distributions visualization of multivariate data and model fitting using regression analysis of variance and the generalized linear model sas integration technologies allows the sas system to use standard protocols like ldap for directory access corba and microsoft s com dcom for inter application communication as well as message oriented middleware like microsoft message queuing and ibm websphere mq also includes the sas proprietary client server protocols used by all sas clients sas intrnet extends sas data retrieval and analysis functionality to the web with a suite of cgi and java tools sas lab superseded by sas enterprise guide sas or operations research sas ph clinical defunct product sas qc quality control provides quality improvement tools sas share a data server that allows multiple users to gain simultaneous access to sas files sas share net discontinued and now part of sas share it allowed a sas share data server to be accessed from non sas clients like jdbc or odbc compliant applications sas spectraview allows visual exploration of large amounts of data once the system has plotted the data in a 3d space users can then visualise it by creating envelope surfaces cutting planes etc which can be animated depending on a fourth parameter time for example sas stat statistical analysis with a number of procedures providing statistical information such as analysis of variance regression multivariate analysis and categorical data analysis note for example the glimmix procedure 23 sas toolkit sas warehouse administrator superseded in sas 9 by sas etl server sas web report studio part of the sas enterprise business intelligence server provides access to query and reporting capabilities on the web aimed at non technical users sas financial management budgeting planning financial reporting and consolidation sas activity based management cost and revenue modeling sas strategy management formerly strategic performance management collaborative scorecards sas scalable performance data server spds distributed data system offering increased performance data processing server edit terminology where many other languages refer to tables rows and columns fields sas uses the terms data sets observations and variables although in some of the gui applications it is not consistent with these terms sometimes referring to columns and rows there are only two kinds of variables in sas numeric and character string by default all numeric variables are stored as 8 byte real it is possible to reduce precision in external storage only date and datetime variables are numeric variables that inherit the c tradition and are stored as either the number of days for date variables or seconds for datetime variables edit features this list is incomplete you can help by expanding it read and write different file formats process data in different formats sas programming language a 4th generation programming language sas data steps are written in a 3rd generation procedural language very similar to pl i sas procs especially proc sql are non procedural and therefore better fit the definition of a 4gl where filtering available in data steps and procs based on sql where clauses incl operators like like and between and built in statistical and random number functions functions for manipulating character and numeric variables version 9 includes perl regular expression processing system of formats and informats these control representation and categorization of data and may be used within data step programs in a wide variety of ways users can create custom formats either by direct specification or via an input dataset comprehensive date and time handling functions a variety of formats to represent date and time information without transformation of underlying values interaction with database products through a subset of sql and ability to use sql internally to manipulate sas data sets almost all sas functions and operators available in proc sql sas access modules allow communication with databases including databases accessible via odbc in most cases database tables can be viewed as though they were native sas data sets as a result applications may combine data from many platforms without the end user needing to know details of or distinctions between data sources direct output of reports to csv html pcl pdf postscript rtf xml and more using output delivery system templates custom tagsets styles incl css and other markup tools available and fully programmable interaction with the operating system for example pipelining on unix and windows and dde on windows fast development time particularly from the many built in procedures functions in formats the macro facility etc an integrated development environment dynamic data driven code generation using the sas macro language can process files containing millions of rows and thousands of columns of data university research centers often offer sas code for advanced statistical techniques especially in fields such as political science economics and business administration large user community supported by sas institute users have a say in future development e g via the annual sasware ballot 24 edit criticism the base sas component had been criticized for its poor graphics when compared with other statistical software packages citation needed with the release of the output delivery system ods for statistical graphics extension in sas 7 and with the use of the sas graph component the graphics have improved significantly 25 the development tools provided which include the enhanced text editor log data step debugger scl debugger are also outdated compared to what other development environments provide citation needed debugging tools are especially lacking finding bugs in modern sas programs that use many macros can be complex sas will often not note the correct line number of execution when reporting an error as diagnostic messages will refer to the expanded macro code edit competitors
