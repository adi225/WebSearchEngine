of questions answered by library reference services 1 which until recently were one of the few institutional sources for such question answering cqa sites make their content questions and associated answers submitted on the site available on the open web and indexable by search engines thus enabling web users to find answers provided for previously asked questions in response to new queries the popularity of such sites have been increasing dramatically for the past several years major sites that provide a general platform for questions of all types include yahoo answers answerbag and quora
