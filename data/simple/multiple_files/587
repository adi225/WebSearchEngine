information awareness office seal the information awareness office iao was established by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa in january 2002 to bring together several darpa projects focused on applying surveillance and information technology to track and monitor terrorists and other asymmetric threats to u s national security by achieving total information awareness tia following public criticism that the development and deployment of this technology could potentially lead to a mass surveillance system the iao was defunded by congress in 2003 however several iao projects continued to be funded and merely run under different names 1 2 3 4 contents 1 history 2 iao research 2 1 human identification at a distance humanid 2 2 evidence extraction and link discovery 2 3

decommissioned information awareness office website click to enlarge the iao was established after admiral john poindexter former united states national security advisor to president ronald reagan and saic executive brian hicks approached the us department of defense with the idea for an information awareness program after the attacks of september 11 2001 3 poindexter and hicks had previously worked together on intelligence technology programs for the defense advanced research projects agency darpa agreed to host the program and appointed poindexter to run it in 2002 the iao began funding research and development of the total information awareness tia program in february 2003 but renamed the program the terrorism information awareness program in may that year after an adverse media reaction to the program s implications for public surveillance although tia was only one of several iao projects many critics and news reports conflated tia with other related research projects of the iao with the result that tia came in popular usage to stand for an entire subset of iao programs the tia program itself was the systems level program of the iao that intended to integrate information technologies into a prototype system to provide tools to better detect classify and identify potential foreign terrorists with the goal to increase the probability that authorized agencies of the united states could preempt adverse actions as a systems level program of programs tia s goal was the creation of a counterterrorism information architecture that integrated technologies from other iao programs and elsewhere as appropriate the tia program was researching developing and integrating technologies to virtually aggregate data to follow subject oriented link analysis to develop descriptive and predictive models through data mining or human hypothesis and to apply such models to additional datasets to identify terrorists and terrorist groups among the other iao programs that were intended to provide tia with component data aggregation and automated analysis technologies were the genisys genisys privacy protection evidence extraction and link discovery and scalable social network analysis programs on august 2 2002 dr poindexter gave a speech at darpatech 2002 entitled overview of the information awareness office 5 in which he described the tia program in addition to the program itself the involvement of poindexter as director of the iao also raised concerns among some since he had been earlier convicted of lying to congress and altering and destroying documents pertaining to the iran contra affair although those convictions were later overturned on the grounds that the testimony used against him was protected on january 16 2003 senator russ feingold introduced legislation to suspend the activity of the iao and the total information awareness program pending a congressional review of privacy issues involved 6 a similar measure introduced by senator ron wyden would have prohibited the iao from operating within the united states unless specifically authorized to do so by congress and would have shut the iao down entirely 60 days after passage unless either the pentagon prepared a report to congress assessing the impact of iao activities on individual privacy and civil liberties or the president certified the program s research as vital to national security interests in february 2003 congress passed legislation suspending activities of the iao pending a congressional report of the office s activities consolidated appropriations resolution 2003 no 108 7 division m 111 b signed feb 20 2003 in response to this legislation darpa provided congress on may 20 2003 with a report on its activities 7 in this report iao changed the name of the program to the terrorism information awareness program and emphasized that the program was not designed to compile dossiers on us citizens but rather to research and develop the tools that would allow authorized agencies to gather information on terrorist networks despite the name change and these assurances the critics continued to see the system as prone to potential misuse or abuse as a result house and senate negotiators moved to prohibit further funding for the tia program by adding provisions to the department of defense appropriations act 2004 8 signed into law by president bush on october 1 2003 further the joint explanatory statement included in the conference committee report specifically directed that the iao as program manager for tia be terminated immediately 9 edit iao research iao research was conducted along five major investigative paths secure collaboration problem solving structured discovery link and group understanding context aware visualization and decision making with corporate memory among the iao projects were edit human identification at a distance humanid diagram from official iao site describing capabilities of the human identification at a distance humanid project 10 the human identification at a distance humanid project developed automated biometric identification technologies to detect recognize and identify humans at great distances for force protection crime prevention and homeland security defense purposes 10 its goals included programs to 10 develop algorithms for locating and acquiring subjects out to 150 meters 500 160 ft in range fuse face and gait recognition into a 24 7 human identification system develop and demonstrate a human identification system that operates out to 150 meters 500 160 ft using visible imagery develop a low power millimeter wave radar system for wide field of view detection and narrow field of view gait classification characterize gait performance from video for human identification at a distance develop a multi spectral infrared and visible face recognition system edit evidence extraction and link discovery evidence extraction and link discovery eeld development of technologies and tools for automated discovery extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources such as phone call records from the nsa call database internet histories or bank records 11 eeld was designed to design systems with the ability to extract data from multiple sources e g text messages social networking sites financial records and web pages it was to develop the ability to detect patterns comprising multiple types of links between data items or people communicating e g financial transactions communications travel etc 11 it is designed to link items relating potential terrorist groups and scenarios and to learn patterns of different groups or scenarios to identify new organizations and emerging threats 11 edit genisys genisys aimed at developing technologies which would enable ultra large all source information repositories 12 vast amounts of information were going to be collected and analyzed and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data so they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation in order to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases as well as unstructured public data sources such as the world wide web effective analysis across heterogenous databases means the ability to take things from databases which are designed to store different types of data such as a database containing criminal records a phone call database and a foreign intelligence database the world wide web is considered an unstructured public data source because it is publicly accessible and contains many different types of data such as blogs emails records of visits to web sites etc all of which need to be analyzed and stored efficiently 12 another goal was to develop a large distributed system architecture for managing the huge volume of raw data input analysis results and feedback that will result in a simpler more flexible data store that performs well and allows us to retain important data indefinitely 12 edit scalable social network analysis scalable social network analysis ssna aimed at developing techniques based on social network analysis for modeling the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminating these groups from other types of societal groups 13 sean mcgahan of northeastern university said the following in his study of ssna the purpose of the ssna algorithms program is to extend techniques of social network analysis to assist with distinguishing potential terrorist cells from legitimate groups of people in order to be successful ssna will require information on the social interactions of the majority of people around the globe since the defense department cannot easily distinguish between peaceful citizens and terrorists it will be necessary for them to gather data on innocent civilians as well as on potential terrorists sean mcgahan 13 edit futures markets applied to prediction futuremap main article future map further information policy analysis market futures markets applied to prediction futuremap was intended to harness collective intelligence by researching prediction market techniques for avoiding surprise and predicting future events the intent was to explore the feasibility of market based trading mechanisms to predict political instability threats to national security and other major events in the near future 14 in laymans terms futuremap would be a website that allowed people to bet on when a terrorist attack would occur 15 the bookie would have been the federal government 15 several senators were outraged at the very notion of such a program 15 then senate minority leader tom daschle said on the floor of the senate i couldn t believe that we would actually commit 8 million to create a web site that would encourage investors to bet on futures involving terrorist attacks and public assassinations i can t believe that anybody would seriously propose that we trade in death how long would it be before you saw traders investing in a way that would bring about the desired result 15 democratic senator from oregon ron wyden said the idea of a federal betting parlor on atrocities and terrorism is ridiculous and it s grotesque 15 the ranking democrat on the armed services committee sen carl levin of michigan thought the program was so ridiculous that he thought initial reports of it were the result of a hoax 15 the program was then dropped edit tides translingual information detection extraction and summarization tides developing advanced language processing technology to enable english speakers to find and interpret critical information in multiple languages without requiring knowledge of those languages 16 outside groups such as universities corporations etc were invited to participate in the annual information retrieval topic detection and tracking automatic content extraction and machine translation evaluations run by nist 16 edit genoa genoa ii genoa and genoa ii focused on providing advanced decision support and collaboration tools to rapidly deal with and adjust to dynamic crisis management and allow for inter agency collaboration in real time 17 18 another function was to be able to make estimates of possible future scenarios to assist intelligence officials in deciding what to do 19 in a manner similar to the darpa s deep green program which is designed to assist army commanders in making battlefield decisions edit wargaming the asymmetric environment wae wargaming the asymmetric environment wae focused on developing automated technology capable of identifying predictive indicators of terrorist activity or impending attacks by examining individual and group behavior in broad environmental context and examining the motivation of specific terrorists 20 edit effective affordable reusable speech to text ears effective affordable reusable speech to text ears to develop automatic speech to text transcription technology whose output is substantially richer and much more accurate than previously possible ears was to focus on everyday human to human speech from broadcasts and telephone conversations in multiple languages 21 it is expected to increase the speed with which speech can be processed by computers by 100 times or more 19 the intent is to create a core enabling technology technology that is used as a component for future technologies suitable for a wide range of future surveillance applications 21 edit babylon babylon to develop rapid two way natural language speech translation interfaces and platforms for the warfighter for use in field environments for force protection refugee processing and medical triage 22 edit bio surveillance bio surveillance to develop the necessary information technologies and resulting prototype capable of detecting the covert release of a biological pathogen automatically and significantly earlier than traditional approaches 23 edit communicator diagram from official iao site describing capabilities of the communicator project communicator was to develop dialogue interaction technology that enables warfighters to talk with computers such that information will be accessible on the battlefield or in command centers without ever having to touch a keyboard the communicator platform was to be both wireless and mobile and to be designed to function in a networked environment 24 the dialogue interaction software was to interpret the context of the dialogue in order to improve performance and to be capable of automatically adapting to new topics because situations quickly change in war so conversation is natural and efficient the communicator program emphasized task knowledge to compensate for natural language effects and noisy environments unlike automated translation of natural language speech which is much more complex due to an essentially unlimited vocabulary and grammar the communicator program is directed task specific issues so that there are constrained vocabularies the system only needs to be able to understand language related to war research was also started to focus on foreign language computer interaction for use in supporting coalition operations 24 live exercises were conducted involving small unit logistics operations involving the united states marines to test the technology in extreme environments 24 edit components of tia projects that continue to be developed despite the withdrawal of funding for the tia and the closing of the iao the core of the project survived 3 4 25 legislators included a classified annex to the defense appropriations act that preserved funding for tia s component technologies if they were transferred to other government agencies tia projects continued to be funded under classified annexes to defense and intelligence appropriation bills however the act also stipulated that the technologies only be used for military or foreign intelligence purposes against foreigners 26 tia s two core projects are now operated by advanced research and development activity arda located among the 60 odd buildings of crypto city at nsa headquarters in fort meade md arda itself has been shifted from the nsa to the disruptive technology office run by to the director of national intelligence they are funded by national foreign intelligence program for foreign counterterrorism intelligence purposes one technology codenamed basketball is the information awareness prototype system the core architecture to integrate all the tia s information extraction analysis and dissemination tools work on this project is conducted by saic through its former hicks amp associates consulting arm run by former defense and military officials and which had originally been awarded us 19 million iao contract to build the prototype system in late 2002 27 the other project has been re designated topsail formerly genoa ii and would provide it tools to help anticipate and preempt terrorist attacks saic has also been contracted to work on topsail including a us 3 7 million contract in 2005 edit media coverage and criticism the first mention of the iao in the mainstream media came from the new york times reporter john markoff on february 13 2002 28 initial reports contained few details about the program in the following months as more information emerged about the scope of the tia project civil libertarians became concerned over what they saw as the potential for the development of an orwellian mass surveillance system on november 14 2002 the new york times published a column by william safire in which he claimed tia has been given a 200 million budget to create computer dossiers on 300 million americans 29 safire has been credited with triggering the anti tia movement 30 edit see also advise carnivore fbi us digital interception program combat zones that see or cts a project to link up all security cameras citywide and
