digital obsolescence is a situation where a digital resource is no longer readable because the physical media the reader required to read the media the hardware or the software that runs on it is no longer available a prime example of this is the bbc domesday project cornell university library s digital preservation tutorial now hosted by icpsr has a timeline of obsolete media formats called the chamber of horrors that shows how rapidly new technologies are created and cast aside contents 1 introduction 2 copyright issues 3 intentional obsolescence 4 see also 5 references 6 external links edit introduction the rapid evolution and proliferation of different kinds of computer hardware modes of digital encoding operating systems and general or specialized software ensures that digital obsolescence will become a problem in the future 1 many versions of word processing programs data storage media standards for encoding images and films are considered standards for some time but in the end are always replaced by new versions of the software or completely new hardware files meant to be read or edited with a certain program for example microsoft word will be unreadable in other programs and as operating systems and hardware move on even old versions of programs developed by the same company become impossible to use on the new platform for instance older versions of microsoft works before works 4 5 cannot be run under windows 2000 or later early attention was brought to the challenges of preserving machine readable data by the work of charles m dollar in the 1970s but it was only during the 1990s that libraries and archives came to appreciate the significance of the problem 2 and has been discussed among professionals in those branches though so far without any obvious solutions other than continual forward migration of files and information to the latest data storage standards file formats should be widespread backward compatible often upgraded and ideally open format the national initiative for a networked cultural heritage cites 3 the following as de facto formats that are unlikely to be rendered obsolete in the near future uncompressed tiff and ascii and rtf for text edit copyright issues untangling copyright issues also presented a significant challenge for projects attempting to overcome the obsolescence issues related to the bbc domesday project in addition to copyright surrounding the many contributions made by the estimated 1 million people who took part in the project there are also copyright issues that relate to the technologies employed it is likely that the domesday project will not be completely free of copyright restrictions until at least 2090 unless copyright laws are revised for earlier expiration 4 edit intentional obsolescence in some cases obsolete technologies are used in a deliberate attempt to avoid data intrusion in a strategy known as security through obsolescence 5 edit see also obsolescence digital preservation digital dark age camileon edit references rothenberg j 1998 avoiding technological quicksand finding a viable technical foundation for digital preservation hedstrom m 1995 digital preservation a time bomb for digital libraries national initiative for a networked cultural heritage 2002 ninch guide to good practice in the digital representation and management of cultural heritage materials charlesworth andrew 5 november 2002 the camileon project legal issues arising from the work aiming to preserve elements of the interactive multimedia work entitled the bbc domesday project microsoft word kingston upon hull information law and technology unit university of hull http www2 si umich edu camileon reports iprreport doc retrieved 23 march 2011 miller robin 2002 06 06 security through obsolescence linux com http www linux com articles 23313 retrieved 2008 07 18 edit external links the library of congress sustainability of digital formats wired magazine what death can t destroy and how to digitize it digital preservation at icpsr home page
