pubmed content contact research center united states national library of medicine nlm release date january 1996 access website www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed tools miscellaneous pubmed is a free database accessing primarily the medline database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics the united states national library of medicine nlm at the national institutes of health maintains the database as part of the entrez information retrieval system pubmed was first released in january 1996 1 contents 1 content 2 characteristics 2 1 standard searches 2 2 comprehensive searches 2 3 clinical queries systematic reviews 2 4 related articles 2 5 mapping to mesh headings and subheadings 2 6 my ncbi 2 7 linkout 2 8 pubmed for handhelds mobiles 2 9 askmedline 2 10 pubmed identifier 3 alternative interfaces 4 see also 5 references 6 external links edit content in addition to medline pubmed provides access to older references from the print version of index medicus back to 1951 and earlier references to some journals before they were indexed in index medicus and medline for instance science bmj and annals of surgery very recent entries to records for an article before it is indexed with medical subject headings mesh and added to medline and a collection of books available full text and other subsets of nlm records 2 many pubmed records contain links to full text articles some of which are freely available often in pubmed central 3 and local mirrors such as uk pubmed central 4 information about the journals indexed in pubmed is found in the nlm catalog 5 as of 6 january 2013 160 2013 01 06 update pubmed has over 22 4 million records going back to 1966 selectively to the year 1865 and very selectively to 1809 about 500 000 new records are added each year as of the same date 13 1 million of pubmed s records are listed with their abstracts and 14 2 million articles have links to full text of which 3 8 million articles are available full text for free for any user to see the current size of the database type 1800 2100 dp or all sb into the pubmed search window 6 edit characteristics edit standard searches simple searches on pubmed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into pubmed s search window pubmed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names relevant mesh terms synonyms boolean operators and nests the resulting terms appropriately enhancing the search formulation significantly in particular by routinely combining using the or operator textwords and mesh terms the examples given in a pubmed tutorial 7 demonstrate how this automatic process works causes sleep walking is translated as etiology subheading or etiology all fields or causes all fields or causality mesh terms or causality all fields and somnambulism mesh terms or somnambulism all fields or sleep all fields and walking all fields or sleep walking all fields likewise heart attack aspirin prevention is translated as myocardial infarction mesh terms or myocardial all fields and infarction all fields or myocardial infarction all fields or heart all fields and attack all fields or heart attack all fields and aspirin mesh terms or aspirin all fields and prevention and control subheading or prevention all fields and control all fields or prevention and control all fields or prevention all fields the new pubmed interface launched in october 2009 encourages the use of such quick google like search formulations they have also been described as telegram searches 8 edit comprehensive searches for comprehensive optimal searches in pubmed it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of its core component medline and especially of the mesh medical subject headings controlled vocabulary used to index medline articles they may also require complex search strategies use of field names tags proper use of limits and other features and are best carried out by pubmed search specialists or librarians 9 who are able to select the right type of search and carefully adjust it for recall and precision 10 edit clinical queries systematic reviews a special feature of pubmed is its clinical queries section where clinical categories systematic reviews and medical genetics subjects can be searched with study type filters automatically applied to identify substantial robust studies 11 as these clinical queries can generate small sets of robust studies with considerable precision it has been suggested that this pubmed section can be used as a point of care resource 12 edit related articles a reference which is judged particularly relevant can be marked and related articles can be identified if relevant several studies can be selected and related articles to all of them can be generated on pubmed or any of the other ncbi entrez databases using the find related data option the related articles are then listed in order of relatedness to create these lists of related articles pubmed compares words from the title and abstract of each citation as well as the mesh headings assigned using a powerful word weighted algorithm 13 the related articles function has been judged to be so precise that some researchers suggest it can be used instead of a full search 14 edit mapping to mesh headings and subheadings a strong feature of pubmed is its ability to automatically link to mesh terms and subheadings examples would be bad breath links to and includes in the search halitosis heart attack to myocardial infarction breast cancer to breast neoplasms where appropriate these mesh terms are automatically expanded that is include more specific terms terms like nursing are automatically linked to nursing mesh or nursing subheading this important feature makes pubmed searches automatically more sensitive and avoids false negative missed hits by compensating for the diversity of medical terminology edit my ncbi the pubmed optional facility my ncbi with free registration provides tools for saving searches filtering search results setting up automatic updates sent by e mail saving sets of references retrieved as part of a pubmed search configuring display formats or highlighting search terms and a wide range of other options 15 the my ncbi area can be accessed from any computer with web access an earlier version of my ncbi was called pubmed cubby 16 edit linkout linkout a nlm facility to link and make available full text local journal holdings 17 some 3 200 sites mainly academic institutions participate in this nlm facility as of march 2010 update from aalborg university in denmark to zymogenetics in seattle 18 users at these institutions see their institutions logo within the pubmed search result if the journal is held at that institution and can access the full text edit pubmed for handhelds mobiles pubmed medline can be accessed via handheld devices using for instance the pico option for focused clinical questions created by the nlm 19 a pubmed mobile option providing access to a mobile friendly simplified pubmed version is also available 20 edit askmedline askmedline a free text natural language query tool for medline pubmed developed by the nlm also suitable for handhelds 21 edit pubmed identifier a pmid pubmed identifier or pubmed unique identifier 22 is a unique number assigned to each pubmed record the assignment of a pmid or pmcid to a publication tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content pmids are assigned to letters to the editor editorial opinions op ed columns and any other piece that the editor chooses to include in the journal as well as peer reviewed papers the existence of the identification number is also not proof that the papers have not been retracted for fraud incompetence or misconduct the announcement about any corrections to original papers may be assigned a pmid edit alternative interfaces the national library of medicine leases the medline information to a number of private vendors such as ovid dialog ebsco knowledge finder and many other commercial non commercial and academic providers 23 as of october 2008 update more than 500 licences had been issued more than 200 of them to non us providers as licences to use medline data are available for free the nlm in effect provides a free testing ground for a wide range 24 of alternative interfaces and 3rd party additions to pubmed one of a very few large professionally curated databases which offers this option lu 24 identifies a sample of 28 current and free web based pubmed versions requiring no installation or registration which are grouped into four categories ranking search results for instance etblast hakia medlineranker 25 misearch 26 clustering results by topics authors journals etc for instance anne o tate 27 clustermed 28 enhancing semantics and visualisation for instance citexplore ebimed 29 medevi 30 improved search interface and retrieval experience for instance askmedline 31 32 babelmesh 33 pubcrawler 34 as most of these and other alternatives rely essentially on pubmed medline data leased under license from the nlm pubmed the term pubmed derivatives has been suggested 24
