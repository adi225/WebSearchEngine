concepts within a domain and the relationships between pairs of concepts it can be used to model a domain and support reasoning about entities in theory an ontology is a formal explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation 1 an ontology renders shared vocabulary and taxonomy which models a domain with the definition of objects and or concepts and their properties and relations 2 ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and are used in artificial intelligence the semantic web systems engineering software engineering biomedical informatics library science enterprise bookmarking and information architecture as a form of knowledge representation about the world or some part of it the creation of domain ontologies is also fundamental to the definition and use of an enterprise architecture framework contents 1 overview 2 history 3 ontology components 4 domain ontologies and upper ontologies 5 ontology engineering 6 ontology languages 7 examples of

origin in philosophy and has been applied in many different ways the word element onto comes from the greek 160 being that which is 160 present participle of the verb 160 be 160 the core meaning within computer science is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types properties and relationship types exactly what is provided around these varies but they are the essentials of an ontology there is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology 3 what many ontologies have in common in both computer science and in philosophy is the representation of entities ideas and events along with their properties and relations according to a system of categories in both fields one finds considerable work on problems of ontological relativity e g quine and kripke in philosophy sowa and guarino in computer science 4 and debates concerning whether a normative ontology is viable e g debates over foundationalism in philosophy debates over the cyc project in ai differences between the two are largely matters of focus philosophers are less concerned with establishing fixed controlled vocabularies than are researchers in computer science while computer scientists are less involved in discussions of first principles such as debating whether there are such things as fixed essences or whether entities must be ontologically more primary than processes other fields make ontological assumptions that are sometimes explicitly elaborated and explored for instance the definition and ontology of economics also sometimes called the political economy is hotly debated especially in marxist economics 1 where it is a primary concern but also in other subfields 2 such concerns intersect with those of information science when the intent of a simulation or model is to enable decisions in the economic realm for instance to determine what capital assets are at risk or how much see risk management all social sciences have explicit ontology issues because they do not have hard falsification disambiguation needed criteria like most models in physical sciences indeed the lack of such widely accepted hard falsification criteria is what defines a social or soft science citation needed edit history historically ontologies arise out of the branch of philosophy known as metaphysics which deals with the nature of reality 160 of what exists this fundamental branch is concerned with analyzing various types or modes of existence often with special attention to the relations between particulars and universals between intrinsic and extrinsic properties and between essence and existence the traditional goal of ontological inquiry in particular is to divide the world at its joints to discover those fundamental categories or kinds into which the world s objects naturally fall 5 during the second half of the 20th century philosophers extensively debated the possible methods or approaches to building ontologies without actually building any very elaborate ontologies themselves by contrast computer scientists were building some large and robust ontologies such as wordnet and cyc with comparatively little debate over how they were built since the mid 1970s researchers in the field of artificial intelligence ai have recognized that capturing knowledge is the key to building large and powerful ai systems ai researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as computational models that enable certain kinds of automated reasoning in the 1980s the ai community began to use the term ontology to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge systems some researchers drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy 6 in the early 1990s the widely cited web page and paper toward principles for the design of ontologies used for knowledge sharing by tom gruber 7 is credited with a deliberate definition of ontology as a technical term in computer science gruber introduced the term to mean a specification of a conceptualization an ontology is a description like a formal specification of a program of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents this definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions but more general and it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy 8 according to gruber 1993 ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes class definitions and the subsumption relation but ontologies need not be limited to these forms ontologies are also not limited to conservative definitions 160 that is definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world 9 to specify a conceptualization one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms 1 edit ontology components main article ontology components contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities regardless of the language in which they are expressed as mentioned above most ontologies describe individuals instances classes concepts attributes and relations in this section each of these components is discussed in turn common components of ontologies include individuals instances or objects the basic or ground level objects classes sets collections concepts classes in programming types of objects or kinds of things attributes aspects properties features characteristics or parameters that objects and classes can have relations ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another function terms complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement restrictions formally stated descriptions of what must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input rules statements in the form of an if then antecedent consequent sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form axioms assertions including rules in a logical form that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application this definition differs from that of axioms in generative grammar and formal logic in those disciplines axioms include only statements asserted as a priori knowledge as used here axioms also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements events the changing of attributes or relations ontologies are commonly encoded using ontology languages edit domain ontologies and upper ontologies a domain ontology or domain specific ontology models a specific domain which represents part of the world particular meanings of terms applied to that domain are provided by domain ontology for example the word card has many different meanings an ontology about the domain of poker would model the playing card meaning of the word while an ontology about the domain of computer hardware would model the punched card and video card meanings an upper ontology or foundation ontology is a model of the common objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies it employs a core glossary that contains the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain sets there are several standardized upper ontologies available for use including dublin core gfo opencyc researchcyc sumo and dolce 10 wordnet while considered an upper ontology by some is not strictly an ontology however it has been employed as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies 11 the gellish ontology is an example of a combination of an upper and a domain ontology since domain ontologies represent concepts in very specific and often eclectic ways they are often incompatible as systems that rely on domain ontologies expand they often need to merge domain ontologies into a more general representation this presents a challenge to the ontology designer different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages different intended usage of the ontologies and different perceptions of the domain based on cultural background education ideology etc at present merging ontologies that are not developed from a common foundation ontology is a largely manual process and therefore time consuming and expensive domain ontologies that use the same foundation ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology elements can be merged automatically there are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies 12 but this area of research is still largely theoretical edit ontology engineering main article ontology engineering ontology engineering or ontology building is a subfield of knowledge engineering that studies the methods and methodologies for building ontologies it studies the ontology development process the ontology life cycle the methods and methodologies for building ontologies and the tool suites and languages that support them 13 14 ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained within software applications and within enterprises and business procedures for a particular domain ontology engineering offers a direction towards solving the interoperability problems brought about by semantic obstacles such as the obstacles related to the definitions of business terms and software classes ontology engineering is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain 15 edit ontology languages main article ontology language an ontology language is a formal language used to encode the ontology there are a number of such languages for ontologies both proprietary and standards based common algebraic specification language is a general logic based specification language developed within the ifip working group 1 3 foundations of system specifications and functions as a de facto standard in the area of software specifications it is now being applied to ontology specifications in order to provide modularity and structuring mechanisms common logic is iso standard 24707 a specification for a family of ontology languages that can be accurately translated into each other the cyc project has its own ontology language called cycl based on first order predicate calculus with some higher order extensions dogma developing ontology grounded methods and applications adopts the fact oriented modeling approach to provide a higher level of semantic stability the gellish language includes rules for its own extension and thus integrates an ontology with an ontology language idef5 is
