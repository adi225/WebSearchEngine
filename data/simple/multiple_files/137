structure a set of interconnected nodes data are typically the results of measurements and can be visualised using graphs or images data as an abstract concept can be viewed as the lowest level of abstraction from which information and then knowledge are derived raw data i e unprocessed data refers to a collection of numbers characters and is a relative term data processing commonly occurs by stages and the processed data from one stage may be considered the raw data of the next field data refers to raw data collected in an uncontrolled in situ environment experimental data refers to data generated within the context of a scientific investigation by observation and recording the word data is the plural of datum neuter past participle of the latin dare to give hence something given in

english the word datum is still used in the general sense of an item given in cartography geography nuclear magnetic resonance and technical drawing it is often used to refer to a single specific reference datum from which distances to all other data are measured any measurement or result is a datum but data point is more usual 1 albeit tautological or more generously pleonastic in one sense datum is a count noun with the plural datums see usage in datum article that can be used with cardinal numbers e g 80 datums data originally a latin plural is not used like a normal count noun with cardinal numbers but it can be used as a plural with plural determiners such as these and many in addition to its use as a singular abstract mass noun with a verb in the singular form 2 even when a very small quantity of data is referenced one number for example the phrase piece of data is often used as opposed to datum the debate over appropriate usage is ongoing 3 4 5 the ieee computer society allows usage of data as either a mass noun or plural based on author preference 6 some professional organizations and style guides 7 dead link require that authors treat data as a plural noun for example the air force flight test center specifically states that the word data is always plural never singular 8 data is most often used as a singular mass noun in educated everyday usage 9 10 dead link some major newspapers such as the new york times use it either in the singular or plural in the new york times the phrases the survey data are still being analyzed and the first year for which data is available have appeared within one day 11 the wall street journal explicitly allows this in its style guide 12 the associated press style guide classifies data as a collective noun that takes the singular when treated as a unit but the plural when referring to individual items the data is sound but the data have been carefully collected 13 in scientific writing data is often treated as a plural as in these data do not support the conclusions but it is also used as a singular mass entity like information for instance in computing and related disciplines 14 british usage now widely accepts treating data as singular in standard english 15 including everyday newspaper usage 16 at least in non scientific use 17 uk scientific publishing still prefers treating it as a plural 18 some uk university style guides recommend using data for both singular and plural use 19 and some recommend treating it only as a singular in connection with computers 20 meaning of data information and knowledge the terms data information and knowledge are frequently used for overlapping concepts the main difference is in the level of abstraction being considered data is the lowest level of abstraction information is the next level and finally knowledge is the highest level among all three 21 data on its own carries no meaning for data to become information it must be interpreted and take on a meaning for example the height of mt everest is generally considered as data a book on mt everest geological characteristics may be considered as information and a report containing practical information on the best way to reach mt everest s peak may be considered as knowledge information as a concept bears a diversity of meanings from everyday usage to technical settings generally speaking the concept of information is closely related to notions of constraint communication control data form instruction knowledge meaning mental stimulus pattern perception and representation beynon davies uses the concept of a sign to distinguish between data and information data are symbols while information occurs when symbols are used to refer to something 22 it is people and computers who collect data and impose patterns on it these patterns are seen as information which can be used to enhance knowledge these patterns can be interpreted as truth and are authorized as aesthetic and ethical criteria events that leave behind perceivable physical or virtual remains can be traced back through data marks are no longer considered data once the link between the mark and observation is broken 23 mechanical computing devices are classified according to the means by which they represent data an analog computer represents a datum as a voltage distance position or other physical quantity a digital computer represents a datum as a sequence of symbols drawn from a fixed alphabet the most common digital computers use a binary alphabet that is an alphabet of two characters typically denoted 0 and 1 more familiar representations such as numbers or letters are then constructed from the binary alphabet some special forms of data are distinguished a computer program is a collection of data which can be interpreted as instructions most computer languages make a distinction between programs and the other data on which programs operate but in some languages notably lisp and similar languages programs are essentially indistinguishable from other data it is also useful to distinguish metadata that is a description of other data a similar yet earlier term for metadata is ancillary data the prototypical example of metadata is the library catalog which is a description of the contents of books see also biological data data acquisition data
