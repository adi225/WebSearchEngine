been used for tactical media as a way of performing a hit and run media attack on popular topics such attacks include anthony cox s attack in 2003 he created a parody of the 404 page not found browser

google s ranking factors for example alex jones creates google bombs every week by dispatching instructions to his radio internet listeners 11 12 in this context the term is used to describe a rapid and massive influx of keyword searches for a particular phrase the keyword surge gives the illusion that the related content has suddenly become popular but it is artificial in nature because it is created by a loyal following of people to a particular media outlet often alternative media the strategy behind this type of google bombing is to attract attention from the larger mainstream media and influence them to publish content related to the keyword edit google bowling by studying what types of ranking manipulations a search engine is punishing a company can provoke a search engine into lowering the ranking of a competitor s website this practice known as google bowling is often done by purchasing google bombing services or other seo techniques not for one s own website but rather for the website of the competitor the attacker provokes the search company into punishing the offending competitor by displaying their page further down in the search results 13 14 for victims of google bowling it may be difficult to appeal the ranking decrease because google avoids explaining penalties preferring not to educate real offenders however if the situation is clear cut google could lift the penalty after submitting a request for reconsideration edit beyond google other search engines use similar techniques to rank results so yahoo altavista and hotbot are also affected by google

some website operators have adapted google bombing techniques to do spamdexing this includes among other techniques posting of links to a site in an internet forum along with phrases the promoter hopes to associate with the site see spam in blogs unlike conventional message board spam the object is not to attract readers to the site directly but to increase the site s ranking under those

of page rank vandalism as all of the pages are freely editable this practice was also called money bombing by john hiler circa 2004 54 55 another technique is for the owner of an internet domain name to set up the domain s dns entry so that all subdomains are directed to the same server the operator then sets up the server so that page requests generate a page full of desired google search terms each linking to a subdomain of the same site with the same title as the subdomain in the requested url frequently the subdomain matches the linked phrase with spaces replaced by underscores or hyphens
