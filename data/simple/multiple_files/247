simple design since its founders were not experienced in html the language for designing web pages 25 google began in january 1996 as a research project by larry page and sergey brin when they were both phd students at stanford university in california 26 while conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships between websites 27 they called this new technology pagerank where a website s relevance was determined by the number of pages and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site 28 29 a small search engine called rankdex from idd information services designed by robin li was since 1996 already exploring a similar strategy for site scoring and page ranking 30 the technology in rankdex would be patented 31 and used later when li founded baidu in china 32 33 page and brin originally nicknamed their new search engine backrub because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site 34 35 36 eventually they changed the name to google originating from a misspelling of the word googol 37 38 the number one followed by one hundred zeros which was picked to signify that the search engine wants to provide large quantities of information for people 39 originally google ran under the stanford university website with the domains google stanford edu and z stanford edu 40 41 the domain name for google was registered on september 15 1997 42 and the company was incorporated on september 4 1998 it was based in a friend s susan wojcicki 26 garage in menlo park california craig silverstein a fellow phd student at stanford was hired as the first employee 26 43 44 in may 2011 the number of monthly unique visitors to google surpassed 1 billion for the first time an 8 4 percent increase from may 2010 931 million 45 in january of 2013 google announced it had earned 50 billion in annual revenue for the year of 2012 this marked the first time google had reached this feat topping their 2011 total of 38 billion 46 financing and initial public offering google s first production server google s production servers continue to be built with inexpensive hardware 47 the first funding for google was an august 1998 contribution of us 100 000 from andy bechtolsheim co founder of sun microsystems given before google was even incorporated 48 early in 1999 while still graduate students brin and page decided that the search engine they had developed was taking up too much of their time from academic pursuits they went to excite ceo george bell and offered to sell it to him for 1 160 million he rejected the offer and later criticized vinod khosla one of excite s venture capitalists after he had negotiated brin and page down to 750 000 on june 7 1999 a 25 160 million round of funding was announced 49 with major investors including the venture capital firms kleiner perkins caufield amp byers and sequoia capital 48 google s initial public offering ipo took place five years later on august 19 2004 at that time larry page sergey brin and eric schmidt agreed to work together at google for 20 years until the year 2024 50 the company offered 19 605 052 shares at a price of 85 per share 51 52 shares were sold in a unique online auction format using a system built by morgan stanley and credit suisse underwriters for the deal 53 54 the sale of 1 67 160 billion gave google a market capitalization of more than 23 160 billion 55 the vast majority of the 271 160 million shares remained under the control of google and many google employees became instant paper millionaires yahoo a competitor of google also benefited because it owned 8 4 160 million shares of google before the ipo took place 56 some people speculated that google s ipo would inevitably lead to changes in company culture reasons ranged from shareholder pressure for employee benefit reductions to the fact that many company executives would become instant paper millionaires 57 as a reply to this concern co founders sergey brin and larry page promised in a report to potential investors that the ipo would not change the company s culture 58 in 2005 however articles in the new york times and other sources began suggesting that google had lost its anti corporate no evil philosophy 59 60 61 in an effort to maintain the company s unique culture google designated a chief culture officer who also serves as the director of human resources the purpose of the chief culture officer is to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on a flat organization with a collaborative environment 62 google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees 63 64 the stock s performance after the ipo went well with shares hitting 700 for the first time on october 31 2007 65 primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market 66 the surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds 66 the company is now listed on the nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol goog and under the frankfurt stock exchange under the ticker symbol ggq1 growth in march 1999 the company moved its offices to palo alto california home to several other noted silicon valley technology startups 67 the next year against page and brin s initial opposition toward an advertising funded search engine 68 google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords 26 in order to maintain an uncluttered page design and increase speed advertisements were solely text based keywords were sold based on a combination of price bids and click throughs with bidding starting at five cents per click 26 this model of selling keyword advertising was first pioneered by goto com an idealab spin off created by bill gross 69 70 when the company changed names to overture services it sued google over alleged infringements of the company s pay per click and bidding patents overture services would later be bought by yahoo and renamed yahoo search marketing the case was then settled out of court with google agreeing to issue shares of common stock to yahoo in exchange for a perpetual license 71 during this time google was granted a patent describing its pagerank mechanism 72 the patent was officially assigned to stanford university and lists lawrence page as the inventor in 2003 after outgrowing two other locations the company leased its current office complex from silicon graphics at 1600 amphitheatre parkway in mountain view california 73 the complex has since come to be known as the googleplex a play on the word googolplex the number one followed by a googol zeroes the googleplex interiors were designed by clive wilkinson architects three years later google would buy the property from sgi for 319 160 million 74 by that time the name google had found its way into everyday language causing the verb google to be added to the merriam webster collegiate dictionary and the oxford english dictionary denoted as to use the google search engine to obtain information on the internet 75 76 acquisitions and partnerships see also list of mergers and acquisitions by google larry page and sergey brin in 2003 since

for the 2006 fiscal year the company reported 10 492 160 billion in total advertising revenues and only 112 160 million in licensing and other revenues 119 google has implemented various innovations in the online advertising market that helped make it one of the biggest brokers in the market using technology from the company doubleclick google can determine user interests and target advertisements so they are relevant to their context and the user that is viewing them 120 121 google analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page 122 google advertisements can be placed on third party websites in a two part program google s adwords allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the google content network through either a cost per click or cost per view scheme the sister service google adsense allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked 123 one of the disadvantages and criticisms of this program is google s inability to combat click fraud when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product which causes that advertiser to pay money to google unduly industry reports in 2006 claim that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were in fact fraudulent or invalid 124 furthermore there has been controversy over google s search within a search where a secondary search box enables the user to find what they are looking for within a particular website it was soon reported that when performing a search within a search for a specific company advertisements from competing and rival companies often showed up along with those results drawing users away from the site they were originally searching 125 another complaint against google s advertising is its censorship of advertisers though many cases concern compliance with the digital millennium copyright act for example in february 2003 google stopped showing the advertisements of oceana a non profit organization protesting a major cruise ship s sewage treatment practices google cited its editorial policy at the time stating google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals groups or organizations 126 the policy was later changed 127 in june 2008 google reached an advertising agreement with yahoo which would have allowed yahoo to feature google advertisements on its web pages the alliance between the two companies was never completely realized due to antitrust concerns by the u s department of justice as a result google pulled out of the deal in november 2008 128 129 in an attempt to advertise its own products google launched a website called demo slam developed to demonstrate technology demos of google products 130 each week two teams compete at putting google s technology into new contexts search engine journal

article google search on february 14 2012 google updated its homepage with a minor twist there are no red lines above the options in the black bar and there is a tab space before the you the sign in button has also changed it is no longer in the black bar instead under it as a button google search a web search engine is the company s most popular service according to market research published by comscore in november 2009 google is the dominant search engine in the united states market with a market share of 65 6 132 google indexes billions 133 of web pages so that users can search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators despite its popularity it has received criticism from a number of organizations in 2003 the new york times complained about google s indexing claiming that google s caching of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content 134 in this case the united states district court of nevada ruled in favor of google in field v google and parker v google 135 136 furthermore the publication 2600 the hacker quarterly has compiled a list of words that the web giant s new instant search feature will not search 137 google watch has also criticized google s pagerank algorithms saying that they discriminate against new websites and favor established sites 138 and has made allegations about connections between google and the nsa and the cia 139 despite criticism the basic search engine has spread to specific services as well including an image search engine the google news search site google maps and more in early 2006 the company launched google video which allowed users to upload search and watch videos from the internet 140 in 2009 however uploads to google video were discontinued so that google could focus more on the search aspect of the service 141 the company even developed google desktop a desktop search application used to search for files local to one s computer discontinued in 2011 google s most recent development in search is its partnership with the united states patent and trademark office to create google patents which enables free access to information about patents and trademarks one of the more controversial search services google hosts is google books the company began scanning books and uploading limited previews and full books where allowed into its new book search engine the authors guild a group that represents 8 000 u s authors filed a class action suit in a new york city federal court against google in 2005 over this new service google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books 142 google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the u s the uk australia and canada 143 furthermore the paris civil court ruled against google in late 2009 asking it to remove the works of la martini re ditions du seuil from its database 144 in competition with amazon com google plans to sell digital versions of new books 145 on july 21 2010 in response to newcomer bing google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence of thumbnails that enlarge when pointed at though web searches still appear in a batch per page format on july 23 2010 dictionary definitions for certain english words began appearing above the linked results for web searches 146 google s algorithm was changed in march 2011 giving more weight to high quality content 147 possibly by the use of n grams to remove spun content 148 productivity tools in addition to its standard web search services google has released over the years a number of online productivity tools gmail a free webmail service provided by google was launched as an invitation only beta program on april 1 2004

currently offers over 7600 mb of free storage with additional storage ranging from 20 gb to 16 tb available for us 0 25 per 1 gb per year 153 furthermore software developers know gmail for its pioneering use of ajax a programming technique that allows web pages to be interactive without refreshing the browser 154 one criticism of gmail has been the potential for data disclosure a risk associated with many online web applications steve ballmer microsoft s ceo 155 liz figueroa 156 mark rasch 157 and the editors of google watch 158 believe the processing of email message content goes beyond proper use but google claims that mail sent to or from gmail is never read by a human being beyond the account holder and is only used to improve relevance of advertisements 159 google docs another part of google s productivity suite allows users to create edit and collaborate on documents in an online environment not dissimilar to microsoft word the service was originally called writely but was obtained by google on march 9 2006 where it was released as an invitation only preview 160 on june 6 after the acquisition google created an experimental spreadsheet editing program 161 which would be combined with google docs on october 10 162 a program to edit presentations would complete the set on september 17 2007 163 before all three services were taken out of beta along with gmail google calendar and all products from the google apps suite on july 7 2009 151 enterprise products google s search appliance at the 2008 rsa conference google entered the enterprise market in february

inferior to another translation google launched its google news service in 2002 the site proclaimed that the company had created a highly unusual site that offers a news service compiled solely by computer algorithms without human intervention google employs no editors managing editors or executive editors 169 the site hosted less licensed news content than yahoo news and instead presented topically selected links to news and opinion pieces along with reproductions of their headlines story leads and photographs 170 the photographs are typically reduced to thumbnail size and placed next to headlines from other news sources on the same topic in order to minimize copyright infringement claims nevertheless agence france presse sued google for copyright infringement in federal court in the district of columbia a case which google settled for an undisclosed amount in a pact that included a license of the full text of afp articles for use on google news 171 in 2006 google made a bid to offer free wireless broadband access throughout the city of san francisco along with internet service provider earthlink large telecommunications companies such as comcast and verizon opposed such efforts claiming it was unfair competition and that cities would be violating their commitments to offer local monopolies to these companies in his testimony before congress on network neutrality in

not permitted to tell consumers who they can call or what they can say broadband carriers should not be allowed to use their market power to control activity online 245 on february 7 2006 vint cerf a
