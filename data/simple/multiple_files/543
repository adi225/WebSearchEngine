a spatial database is a database that is optimized to store and query data that is related to objects in space including points lines and polygons while typical databases can understand various numeric and character types of data additional functionality needs to be added for databases to process spatial data types these are typically called geometry or feature the open geospatial consortium created the simple features specification and sets standards for adding spatial functionality to database systems 1 contents 1 features of spatial databases 2 spatial index 3 spatial database systems

optimal for spatial queries instead spatial databases use a spatial index to speed up database operations in addition to typical sql queries such as select statements spatial databases can perform a wide variety of spatial operations the following query types and many more are supported by the open geospatial consortium spatial measurements finds the distance between points polygon area etc spatial functions modify existing features to create new ones for example by providing a buffer around them intersecting features etc spatial predicates allows true false queries such as is there a residence located within a mile of the area we are planning to build the landfill see de 9im constructor functions creates new features with an sql query specifying the vertices points of nodes which can make up lines if the first and last vertex of a line are identical the feature can also be of the type polygon a closed line observer functions queries which return specific information about a feature such as the location of the center of a circle not all spatial databases support these query types many support simplified or modified sets especially in cases of nosql systems like mongodb and couchdb edit spatial index spatial indices are used by spatial databases databases which store information related to objects in space to optimize spatial queries many conventional index types do not efficiently handle features such as how far two points differ or whether points fall within a spatial area of interest common spatial index methods include citation needed grid spatial index z order curve quadtree octree ub tree r tree typically the preferred method for indexing spatial data citation needed objects shapes lines and points are grouped using the minimum bounding rectangle mbr objects are added to an mbr within the index that will lead to the smallest increase in its size r tree r tree hilbert r tree x tree kd tree m tree an m tree index can be used for the efficient resolution of similarity queries on complex objects as compared using an arbitrary metric edit spatial database systems all opengis specifications compliant products 2 open source spatial databases

datatypes functions and utilities ibm db2 spatial extender can be used to enable any edition of db2 including the free db2 express c with support for spatial types oracle spatial microsoft sql server has support for spatial types since version 2008 postgresql dbms database management system uses the spatial extension postgis to implement the standardized datatype geometry and corresponding functions mysql dbms implements the datatype geometry plus some spatial functions that haven t been implemented according to the opengis specifications functions that test spatial relationships are limited to working with minimum bounding rectangles rather than the actual geometries mysql versions earlier than 5 0 16 only supported spatial data in myisam tables as of mysql 5 0 16 innodb ndb bdb and archive also support spatial features neo4j graph database that can build 1d and 2d indexes as btree quadtree and hilbert curve directly in the graph allegrograph a graph database provides a novel mechanism for efficient storage and retrieval of two dimensional geospatial coordinates for resource description framework data it includes an extension syntax for sparql queries mongodb supports
