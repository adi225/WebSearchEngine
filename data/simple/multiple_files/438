the word china is derived from persian cin which is from sanskrit c na 32 it is first recorded in 1516 in the journal of portuguese explorer duarte barbosa 33 it appears in english in a translation published in 1555 34 the sanskrit word was used to refer to china as early as ad 150 35 there are various scholarly theories regarding the origin of this word the traditional theory proposed in the 17th century by martino martini is that china is derived from qin the westernmost of the chinese kingdoms during the zhou dynasty or from the succeeding qin dynasty 221 206 bc 36 the word c na is used in two hindu scriptures the mah bh rata of the 5th century bc and the laws of manu of the 2nd century bc to refer to a country located in the tibetan burman borderlands east of india 37 38 in china common names for the country include zh nggu chinese literally the middle state s and zh nghu chinese although the country s official name has been changed numerous times by successive dynasties and modern governments the term zhongguo appeared in various ancient texts such as the classic of history of the 6th century bc 39 and in pre imperial times it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the huaxia tribes from perceived barbarians the term which can be either singular or plural referred to the group of states in the central plain it was only in the nineteenth century that it emerged as a common name for the country as a whole the chinese were not unique in regarding their country as central since other civilizations had the same view 40 history main articles history of china and timeline of chinese history prehistory main article chinese prehistory archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited china between 250 000 and 2 24 million years ago 41 a

without written records from the period some of the thousands of life size terracotta warriors of the qin dynasty ca 210 bc the first chinese dynasty that left historical records the loosely feudal shang yin settled along the yellow river in eastern china from the 17th to the 11th century bc the oracle bone script of the shang dynasty represents the oldest form of chinese writing yet found and the direct ancestor of the modern chinese characters used throughout east asia the shang were invaded from the west by the zhou who ruled between the 12th and 5th centuries bc until their centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords many independent states eventually emerged out of the weakened zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the 300 year long spring and autumn period only occasionally deferring to the zhou king by the time of the warring states period of the 5th 3rd centuries bc there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now china each with its own king ministry and army 47 the great wall of china was built by several dynasties over two thousand years to protect the sedentary agricultural regions of the chinese interior from incursions by nomadic pastoralists of the northern steppes imperial china the first unified chinese state was established by qin shi huang of the qin state in 221 bc qin shi huang proclaimed himself the first emperor and imposed many reforms throughout china notably the forced standardization of the chinese language measurements length of cart axles and currency the qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after qin shi huang s death as its harsh legalist and authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion 48 49 the subsequent han dynasty ruled china between 206 bc and 220 ad and created a lasting han cultural identity among its populace that has endured to the present day 48 49 the han dynasty expanded the empire s territory considerably with military campaigns reaching korea vietnam mongolia and central asia and also helped establish the silk road in central asia china was for a large part of the last two millennia the world s largest economy 50 however in the later part of the qing dynasty china s economic development began to slow and europe s rapid development in the industrial revolution enabled it to surpass china after the collapse of han another period of disunion followed including the highly chivalric period of the three kingdoms 51 independent chinese states of this period such as wu opened diplomatic relations with japan 52 introducing the chinese writing system there in 580 ad china was reunited under the sui 53 however the sui dynasty declined following its defeat in the goguryeo sui war 598 614 54 55 under the succeeding tang and song dynasties chinese technology and culture entered a golden age 56 the tang empire was at its height of power until the middle of the 8th century when the an shi rebellion destroyed the prosperity of the empire 57 the song dynasty was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy 58 between the 10th and 11th centuries the population of china doubled in size this growth came about through expanded rice cultivation in central and southern china and the production of abundant food surpluses within its borders the northern song dynasty had a population of some 100 million people the song dynasty was a culturally rich period for philosophy and the arts landscape art and portrait painting were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity after the tang dynasty and social elites gathered to view art share their own and trade precious artworks philosophers such as cheng yi and chu hsi reinvigorated confucianism with new commentary infused buddhist ideals and emphasized a new organization of classic texts that brought about the core doctrine of neo confucianism detail from along the river during the qingming festival a 12th century painting showing everyday life in the song dynasty s capital city bianjing today s kaifeng in 1271 the mongol leader and fifth khagan of the mongol empire kublai khan established the yuan dynasty with the last remnant of the song dynasty falling to the yuan in 1279 before the mongol invasion chinese dynasties reportedly had approximately 120 million inhabitants after the conquest was completed in 1279 the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people 59 late dynastic rule a peasant named zhu yuanzhang overthrew the yuan dynasty in 1368 and founded the ming dynasty 60 under the ming dynasty china enjoyed another golden age developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture it was during this period that zheng he led explorations throughout the world reaching as far as africa 61 in the early years of the ming dynasty china s capital was moved from nanjing to beijing during the ming dynasty thinkers such as wang yangming further critiqued and expanded neo confucianism with concepts of individualism and innate morality that would have tremendous impact on later japanese thought chosun korea also became a nominal vassal state of ming china and adopted much of its neo confucian bureaucratic structure in 1644 beijing was sacked by a coalition of rebel forces led by li zicheng a minor ming official who led the peasant revolt the last ming chongzhen emperor committed suicide when the city fell the manchu qing dynasty then allied with ming dynasty general wu sangui and overthrew li s short lived shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of beijing which became the new capital of the qing dynasty in total the manchu conquest of china cost as many as 25 million lives 62 the qing dynasty which lasted until 1912 was the last imperial dynasty of china in the 19th century the qing dynasty adopted a defensive posture towards european imperialism even though it engaged in an imperialistic expansion of its own into central asia at this time china awoke to the significance of the rest of the world the west in particular as china opened up to foreign trade and missionary activity opium produced by british india was forced onto qing china two opium wars with britain weakened the emperor s control western imperialism proved to be disastrous for china the end of the opium war marked the beginning of western imperialism in china unequal treaties imposed at the end of the war forced china to relinquish hong kong open new treaty ports to foreign trade pay indemnities to her vanquishers and allow foreigners to live and work on chinese soil free of the jurisdiction of chinese law extraterritoriality over the years new wars with western powers would expand these impositions on china s national sovereignty culminating in the treaty of shimonoseki which ended the sino japanese war of 1894 95 63 a 19th century painting depicting the taiping rebellion of 1850 1864 the weakening of the qing regime and the apparent humiliation of the unequal treaties in the eyes of the chinese people led to increasing domestic disorder in late 1850 southern china erupted in the taiping rebellion a violent civil war which lasted until 1864 the rebellion was led by hong xiuquan who was partly influenced by an idiosyncratic interpretation of christianity hong believed himself to be the son of god and the younger brother of jesus although the qing forces were eventually victorious the civil war was one of the bloodiest in human history costing at least 20 million lives more than the total number of fatalities in world war i with some estimates of up to 40 million other costly rebellions followed the taiping rebellion such as the punti hakka clan wars 1855 67 nien rebellion 1851 1868 miao rebellion 1854 73 panthay rebellion 1856 1873 and the dungan revolt 1862 1877 64 65 these rebellions each resulted in an estimated loss of several million lives and had a devastating impact on the fragile economy 66 67 68 the flow of british opium hastened the empire s decline in the 19th century the age of colonialism was at its height and the great chinese diaspora began today about 35 million overseas chinese live in southeast asia 69 emigration rates were strengthened by domestic catastrophes such as the northern chinese famine of 1876 1879 which claimed between 9 and 13 million lives in northern china 70 from 108 bc to 1911 ad china experienced 1 828 known famines 71 or nearly one per year somewhere in the empire 72 in the first sino japanese war of 1894 95 which was fought over influence in korea japanese troops defeated qing forces while china was wracked by continuous war meiji japan succeeded in rapidly modernizing its military and set its sights on the conquest of korea and manchuria at the request of the korean emperor the qing government sent troops to aid in suppressing the tonghak rebellion in 1894 however japan also sent troops to korea leading to the first sino japanese war which resulted in qing china s loss of influence in the korean peninsula as well as the cession of taiwan including the pescadores to japan in 1895 73 following this series of defeats a reform plan for the empire to become a modern meiji style constitutional monarchy was drafted by the guangxu emperor in 1898 but was opposed and stopped by the empress dowager cixi who placed emperor guangxu under house arrest in a coup d tat the ill fated boxer rebellion of 1898 1901 in which westerners in beijing were targeted en masse resulted in as many as 115 000 deaths 74 by the early 20th century mass civil disorder had begun and calls for reform and revolution were heard across the country the 38 year old emperor guangxu died under house arrest on 14 november 1908 suspiciously just a day before cixi s own death with the throne empty he was succeeded by cixi s handpicked heir his two year old nephew puyi who became the xuantong emperor guangxu s consort became the empress dowager longyu in another coup d tat in 1912 yuan shikai overthrew puyi and forced longyu to sign the abdication decree

china sun yat sen the father of modern china seated on right and chiang kai shek later president of the republic of china on 1 january 1912 the republic of china was established heralding the end of imperial china 75 sun yat sen of the kuomintang the kmt or nationalist party was proclaimed provisional president of the republic 76 however the presidency was later given to yuan shikai a former qing general who had ensured the defection of the entire beiyang army from the qing empire to the revolution in 1915 yuan proclaimed himself emperor of china but was forced to abdicate and reestablish the republic in the face of popular condemnation not only from the general population but also from among his own beiyang army and its commanders 77 after yuan shikai s death in 1916 china was politically fragmented with an internationally recognized but virtually powerless national government seated in beijing regional warlords exercised actual control over their respective territories 78 79 in the late 1920s the nationalist kuomintang under chiang kai shek was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings known collectively as the northern expedition 80 81 the kuomintang moved the nation s capital to nanjing and implemented political tutelage an intermediate stage of political development outlined in sun yat sen s san min program for transforming china into a modern democratic state effectively political tutelage meant one party rule by the kuomintang but the party was politically divided into competing cliques 82 83 this political division made it difficult for chiang to battle the communists which the kuomintang had been warring against since 1927 in the chinese civil war this war continued successfully for the kuomintang especially after the communists retreated in the long march until the xi an incident and japanese aggression forced chiang to confront imperial japan 84 85 the second sino japanese war 1937 1945 a part of world war ii forced an uneasy alliance between the kuomintang and the communists the japanese three all policy in northern china kill all burn all and destroy all led to numerous war atrocities being committed against the civilian population in all as many as 20 million chinese civilians died 86 87 an estimated 200 000 chinese were massacred in the city of nanjing alone during the japanese occupation 88 japan unconditionally surrendered to china in 1945 taiwan including the pescadores was put under the administrative control of the republic of china which immediately claimed sovereignty china emerged victorious but war ravaged and financially drained the continued distrust between the kuomintang and the communists led to the resumption of civil war in 1947 constitutional rule was established but because of the ongoing unrest many provisions of the roc constitution were never implemented in mainland china 89 90 91 people s republic of china 1949 present main article history of the people s republic of china major combat in the chinese civil war ended in 1949 with the communist party in control of mainland china and the kuomintang retreating offshore reducing the roc s territory to only taiwan hainan and their surrounding islands on 1 october 1949 mao zedong proclaimed the people s republic of china 92 which was commonly known in the west as communist china or red china during the cold war 93 in 1950 the people s liberation army succeeded in capturing hainan from the roc occupying tibet and defeating the majority of the remaining kuomintang forces in yunnan and xinjiang provinces though some kuomintang holdouts survived until much later mao zedong proclaiming the establishment of the people s republic of china in 1949 mao encouraged population growth and under his leadership the chinese population almost doubled from around 550 million to over 900 million 94 however mao s great leap forward a large scale economic and social reform project resulted in an estimated 45 160 million deaths between 1958 and 1961 mostly from starvation 95 between 1 and 2 million landlords were executed as counterrevolutionaries 96 in 1966 mao and his allies launched the cultural revolution which would last until mao s death a decade later the cultural revolution motivated by power struggles within the party and a fear of the soviet union led to a major upheaval in chinese society in october 1971 the prc replaced the republic of china in the united nations and took its seat as a permanent member of the security council in that same year for the first time the number of countries recognizing the prc surpassed those recognizing the roc in taipei as the government of china 97 in february 1972 at the peak of the sino soviet split mao and zhou enlai met richard nixon in beijing however the us did not officially recognise the prc as china s sole legitimate government until 1 january 1979 after mao s death in 1976 and the arrest of the gang of four who were blamed for the excesses of the cultural revolution deng xiaoping quickly wrested power from mao s anointed successor hua guofeng although he never became the head of the party or state himself deng was in fact the paramount leader of china at that time his influence within the party led the country to significant economic reforms the communist party subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens personal lives and the communes were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production this turn of events marked china s transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment a system termed by some market socialism 98 the communist party of china officially describes it as socialism with chinese characteristics china adopted its current constitution on 4 december 1982 the death of pro reform official hu yaobang helped to spark the tiananmen square protests of 1989 during which students and others campaigned for several months speaking out against corruption and in favour of greater political reform including democratic rights and freedom of speech however they were eventually put down on 4 june when pla troops and vehicles entered and forcibly cleared the square resulting in numerous casualties this event was widely reported and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the government 99 100 the tank man incident in particular became famous the city of shanghai has become a symbol of china s rapid economic expansion since the 1990s president jiang zemin and premier zhu rongji both former mayors of shanghai led the nation in the 1990s under jiang and zhu s ten years of administration china s economic performance pulled an estimated 150 160 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11 2 101 102 the country formally joined the world trade organization in 2001 although rapid economic growth has made the chinese economy the world s second largest this growth has also severely impacted the country s resources and environment 103 another concern is that the benefits of economic development has not been distributed evenly resulting in a wide development gap between urban and rural areas as a result under president hu jintao and premier wen jiabao the chinese government initiated policies to address these issues of equitable distribution of resources though the outcome remains to be seen 104 more than 40 160 million farmers have been displaced from their land 105 usually for economic development contributing to the 87 000 demonstrations and riots which took place across china in 2005 alone 106 living standards have improved significantly but political controls remain tight 107 although china largely succeeded in maintaining its rapid rate of economic growth despite the late 2000s recession its growth rate began to slow in the early 2010s and the economy remains overly focused on fixed investment 108 109 110 in addition preparations for a major communist party leadership change in late 2012 were marked by factional disputes and political scandals such as the fall from power of chongqing official bo xilai 111 during china s decadal leadership reshuffle in november 2012 hu jintao and wen jiabao were replaced as president and

have become important issues in china s relations with other countries melting glaciers in the himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people 125 china s climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer in the winter northern winds coming from high latitude areas are cold and dry in summer southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist the climate in china differs from region to region because of the country s highly complex topography

environmental deterioration and pollution 135 while regulations such as the 1979 environmental protection law are fairly stringent they are poorly enforced as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favour of rapid economic development as a result public protests and riots over environmental issues have become increasingly common 136 environmental campaigners such as ma jun have warned of the danger that water pollution poses to chinese society 137 according to the chinese ministry of water resources roughly 300 160 million chinese do not have access to safe drinking water and 40 of china s rivers have been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste as of late 2011 138 this crisis is compounded by the perennial problem of water shortages with 400 out of 600 surveyed chinese cities reportedly short of drinking water 139 140 additionally numerous major chinese coastal cities including shanghai are deemed to be highly vulnerable to large scale flooding 141 however china is the world s leading investor in renewable energy technologies with 52 160 billion invested in 2011 alone 142 143 144 china produces more wind turbines and solar panels than any other country 145 and renewable energy projects such as solar water heating are widely pursued at the local level 146 by 2009 over 17 of china s energy was derived from renewable

republic of china the people s republic of china along with vietnam laos and cuba is one of the world s four remaining official socialist states espousing communism 149 150 however in practice china s political structure cannot be characterized so simply 11 the chinese government has been variously described as communist and socialist but also as authoritarian with heavy restrictions remaining in many areas most notably on the internet the press freedom of assembly reproductive rights and freedom of religion 151 its current political economic system has been termed by its leaders as socialism with chinese characteristics the country is ruled by the communist party of china cpc whose power is enshrined in china s constitution 152 the chinese electoral system is hierarchical whereby local people s congresses are directly elected and all higher levels of people s congresses up to the national people s congress npc are indirectly elected by the people s congress of the level immediately

cppcc the great hall of the people in beijing where the national people s congress convenes compared to its closed door policies until the mid 1970s the liberalization of china has resulted in the administrative climate being less restrictive than before china nominally supports the leninist principle of democratic centralism 155 but chinese politics are far different from the liberal democracy or social democracy espoused in most european and north american countries and the national people s congress has been described as a rubber stamp body 156 china s incumbent president is hu jintao and its premier is wen jiabao who is also a former senior member of the cpc politburo standing committee the general secretary of the communist party of china is currently xi jinping who is also the chairman of the central military commission and serves as the country s paramount leader 112 there have been some moves toward political liberalization in that open contested elections are now held at

on 9 may 1950 163 in 1971 the prc replaced the republic of china as the sole representative of china in the united nations and as one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council 164 china was also a former member and leader of the non aligned movement and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries 165 under its interpretation of the one china policy china has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the republic of china chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to taiwan 166 especially in the matter of armament sales 167 political meetings between foreign government officials and the 14th dalai lama are also opposed by china as it considers tibet to be formally part of china 168 much of china s current foreign policy is reportedly based on zhou enlai s five principles of peaceful coexistence non interference in other states affairs non aggression peaceful coexistence equality and mutual benefits china s foreign policy is also driven by the concept of harmony without uniformity which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences this policy has led china to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by western nations such as zimbabwe north korea and iran 169 conflicts with foreign countries have occurred at times in china s recent history particularly with the united states for example the us bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade during the kosovo conflict in may 1999 and the us china spy plane incident in april 2001 china s foreign relations with many western nations suffered for a time following the military crackdown on the tiananmen square protests of 1989 although in recent years china has improved its diplomatic links with the west 170 171 china furthermore

rapid economic progress growing military might very large population and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a prominent global role in the 21st century 29 others however warn that economic bubbles and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt china s growth as the century progresses 196 197 198 199 200 201 some authors also question the definition of superpower

movement social activists and some members of the communist party of china have all identified the need for social and political reform while economic and social controls have been greatly relaxed in china since the 1970s political freedom is still tightly restricted the constitution of the people s republic of china states that the fundamental rights of citizens include freedom of speech freedom of the press the right to a fair trial freedom of religion universal suffrage and property rights however in practice these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state 203 204 205 rural migrants to china s cities often find themselves treated as second class citizens by the hukou household registration system which controls access to state benefits 206 207 property rights are often poorly protected 206 and taxation disproportionately affects poorer citizens 207 however a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s and additional social services provided to rural dwellers 208 209 censorship of political speech and information most notably on the internet 210 211 212 is openly and routinely used in china to silence criticism of the government and the ruling communist party 213 214 215 in 2005 reporters without borders ranked china 159th out of 167 states in its annual world press freedom index indicating a very low level of perceived press freedom 216 the government has suppressed demonstrations by organizations that it considers a potential threat to social stability as was the case with the tiananmen square protests of 1989 the communist party has had mixed success in controlling information a powerful and pervasive media control system faces equally strong market forces an increasingly educated citizenry and technological and cultural changes that are making china more open to the wider world 217 218 however attempts are still made by the chinese government to control public access to outside information online searches for politically sensitive material are blocked by the so called great firewall 219 and anonymous online political postings are prohibited by law 212 220 a number of foreign governments and ngos routinely criticize china s human rights record alleging widespread civil rights violations including systematic use of lengthy detention without trial forced confessions torture mistreatment of prisoners and restrictions of freedom of speech assembly association religion the press and labor rights 151 china executes more people than any other country nearly 30 times more per capita than the united states 221 this high execution rate is partly due to the fact that numerous white collar crimes such as fraud are punishable by death in china however in the early 2010s china began restricting the application of capital punishment for some such crimes 222 the chinese government has also been criticized for china s lack of religious freedom including policies targeting christians tibetan buddhists and falun gong members 223 224 the government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the notion of human rights should take into account a country s present level of economic development and focus more on the people s rights to subsistence and development in poorer countries 225 it emphasizes the rise in the standard of living literacy and life expectancy for the average chinese since the 1970s as well as improvements in workplace safety and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial yangtze river floods 225 226 227 some chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratisation whereas others remain more conservative in 2010 premier wen jiabao stated that china needs to gradually improve the democratic election system so that state power will truly belong to the people and state power will be used to serve the people despite his status wen s comments were later censored by the government 228

reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the self strengthening movement after the communist victory in the chinese civil war in 1949 efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the soviet union however mao zedong s cultural revolution of 1966 76 had a catastrophic effect on chinese research as academics were persecuted and the training of scientists and engineers was severely curtailed for nearly a decade after mao s death in 1976 science and technology was established as one of the four modernizations and the soviet inspired academic system was gradually reformed 308 the launch of china s manned shenzhou 7 spacecraft aboard a long march 2f carrier rocket on 25 september 2008 modern era since the end of the cultural revolution china has become one of the world s leading technological powers 309 spending over us 100 billion on scientific research and development in 2011 alone 310 science and technology are seen as vital for achieving economic and political goals and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as techno nationalism 311 almost all of the members of the politburo standing committee of the communist party of china have engineering degrees 312 china is rapidly developing its education system with an emphasis on science mathematics and engineering in 2009 it produced over 10 000 ph d engineering graduates and as many as 500 000 bsc graduates more than any other country 313 china is also the world s second largest publisher of scientific papers producing 121 500 in 2010 alone including 5 200 in leading international scientific journals 314 chinese technology companies such as huawei and lenovo have become world leaders in telecommunications and personal computing 315

exploration program includes a planned lunar rover launch in 2013 and possibly a manned lunar landing in 2025 322 323 experience gained from the lunar program may be used for future programs such as the exploration of mars and venus 324 however some foreign analysts have accused china of covertly using its civilian space missions for military purposes such as the launch of surveillance satellites

broadband subscribers whereas the world s ten largest broadband service providers combined accounted for 39 of the world s broadband customers china telecom alone serves 55 million broadband subscribers while china unicom serves more than 40 million the massive rise in internet use in china continues to fuel rapid broadband growth whereas the world s other major broadband isps operate in the mature markets of the developed world with high levels of broadband penetration and rapidly slowing subscriber growth 332 several chinese telecommunications companies most notably huawei and zte

states as the world s largest automobile market in 2009 with total car sales of over 13 6 160 million 335 analysts predict that annual car sales in china may rise as high as 40 million by 2020 336 a side effect of the rapid growth of china s road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents mostly caused by poorly enforced traffic laws in 2011 alone around 62 000 chinese died in road accidents and efforts to improve traffic safety have had limited success 337 338 china also possesses the world s longest high speed rail network with over 9 676 160 km 6 012 160 mi of service routes

has begun a us 250 billion five year project to expand and modernize domestic air travel 343 however long distance transportation remains dominated by railways and charter bus systems railways are the vital carrier in china they are monopolized by the state and divided into various railway bureaux in different regions due to huge demand the system is regularly subject to overcrowding particularly during holiday seasons such as chunyun during the chinese new year the chinese rail network carried an estimated 1 68 billion total passengers in 2010 alone 342 in urban areas bicycles remain an extremely common mode of transport despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles as of 2012 there are approximately 470 million bicycles in china 344 rapid transit systems are also rapidly developing in china s major cities in the form of networks of underground or light rail systems hong kong has one of the most developed public transport systems in the world while shanghai has a high speed maglev rail line connecting the city to its main international airport pudong international airport china is additionally developing its own satellite navigation system dubbed beidou which began

dwindling natural resources china is very concerned about its population growth and has attempted with mixed results 350 to implement a strict family planning policy known as the one child policy the government s goal is one child per family with exceptions for ethnic minorities and a degree of flexibility in rural areas it is hoped that population growth in china will stabilize in the early decades of the 21st century though some projections estimate a population of anywhere between 1 4 160 billion and 1 6 160 billion by 2025 china s family planning minister has indicated that the one child policy will be maintained until at least 2020 351 population of china from 1949 to 2008 the one child policy is resisted particularly in rural areas because of the need for agricultural labour and a traditional preference for boys who can later serve as male heirs families who breach the policy often lie during the census 352 the decreasing reliability of chinese population statistics since family planning began in the late 1970s has made evaluating the effectiveness of the policy difficult 352 data from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may now be around 1 4 353 the government is particularly concerned with the large imbalance in the sex ratio at birth apparently the result of a combination of traditional preference for boys and family planning pressure which led to a ban on using ultrasound devices for non emergency applications in an attempt to prevent sex selective abortion 354 according to the 2010 census there were 118 06 boys born for every 100 girls which is 0 53 points lower than the ratio obtained from a population sample survey carried out in 2005 355 however the gender ratio of 118 06 is still beyond the normal range of around 105 percent and experts warn of increased social instability should this trend continue 356 for the population born between the years 1900 and 2000 it is estimated that there could be 35 59 million fewer females than males 357 other demographers argue that perceived gender imbalances may arise from the underreporting of female births 358 359 360 361 a recent study suggests that as many as three million chinese

were nearly eradicated by the campaign after deng xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978 the health of the chinese public improved rapidly due to better nutrition although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the people s communes healthcare in china became mostly privatised and experienced a significant rise in quality the

organizations which lack official approval can be subject to state persecution 223 401 an accurate estimate of the number of religious adherents is hard to obtain because of a lack of official data but there is a general consensus that religious belief has been enjoying a resurgence in china since the late 1980s 402 a 1998 survey by adherents com found that 59 over 700 160 million of the population was non religious 403 a later survey conducted in 2007 found that there were 300 160 million religious believers in china constituting 23 of the population as distinct from the official figure of 100 160 million 402 despite the surveys varying results most agree that china s traditional religions buddhism taoism and chinese folk religions are the dominant faiths according to various

of the fact that one person may subscribe to two or more of these traditional beliefs simultaneously and the difficulty in clearly differentiating buddhism taoism and chinese folk religions there is likely a strong degree of overlap in the number of adherents of these religions in addition some who subscribe to buddhism and taoism follow their philosophies in principle but stop short of believing in any kind of deity or divinity 410 411 412 saint sophia cathedral in harbin northeast china by 1921 harbin had a russian population of around 100 000 feeding the growth of christianity in the city

of cultural refinement in china such as the belief that calligraphy and literati painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward looking national perspective 29 a number of more authoritarian and rational strains of thought were also influential with legalism being a prominent example there was often conflict between the philosophies for instance the individualistic song dynasty neo confucians believed that legalism departed from the original spirit of confucianism examinations and a culture of merit

aspects of chinese culture such as rural land tenure sexism and the confucian system of education while preserving others such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state some observers see the period following the establishment of the prc in 1949 as a continuation of traditional chinese dynastic history while others claim that the communist party s rule has damaged the foundations of chinese culture especially through political movements such as the cultural revolution of the 1960s where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed having been denounced as regressive and harmful or vestiges of feudalism many important aspects of traditional chinese morals and culture such as confucianism chinese art literature and performing arts like peking opera were
