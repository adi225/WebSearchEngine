in the fields of medicine biotechnology and pharmacology drug discovery is the process by which new candidate medications are discovered historically drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipitous discovery later chemical libraries of synthetic small molecules natural products or extracts were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable therapeutic effect in a process known as classical pharmacology since sequencing of the human genome which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins it has become common practice to use high throughput screening of large compounds libraries against isolated biological targets which are hypothesized to be disease modifying in a process known as reverse pharmacology hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for efficacy even more recently scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level and to use that knowledge to design see drug design drug candidates modern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits medicinal chemistry 160 and optimization of those hits to increase the affinity selectivity to reduce the potential of side effects efficacy potency metabolic stability to increase the half life and oral bioavailability once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified it will begin the process of drug development prior to clinical trials one or more of these steps may but not necessarily involve computer aided drug design despite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems drug discovery is still a lengthy expensive difficult and inefficient process with low rate of new therapeutic discovery 1 currently the research and development cost of each new molecular entity nme is approximately us 1 8 billion 2 contents 1 drug targets 2 screening

pharmaceutical industry generally the target is the naturally existing cellular or molecular structure involved in the pathology of interest that the drug in development is meant to act on however the distinction between a new and established target can be made without a full understanding of just what a target is this distinction is typically made by pharmaceutical companies engaged in discovery and development of therapeutics in an estimate from 2011 435 human genome products were identified as therapeutic drug targets of fda approved drugs 3 established targets are those for which there is a good scientific understanding supported by a lengthy publication history of both how the target functions in normal physiology and how it is involved in human pathology this does not imply that the mechanism of action of drugs that are thought to act through a particular established targets is fully understood rather established relates directly to the amount of background information available on a target in particular functional information the more such information is available the less investment is generally required to develop a therapeutic directed against the target the process of gathering such functional information is called target validation in pharmaceutical industry parlance established targets also include those that the pharmaceutical industry has had experience mounting drug discovery campaigns against in the past such a history provides information on the chemical feasibility of developing a small molecular therapeutic against the target and can provide licensing opportunities and freedom to operate indicators with respect to small molecule therapeutic candidates in general new targets are all those targets that are not established targets but which have been or are the subject of drug discovery campaigns these typically include newly discovered proteins or proteins whose function has now become clear as a result of basic scientific research the majority of targets currently selected for drug discovery efforts are proteins two classes predominate g protein coupled receptors or gpcrs and protein kinases edit screening and design the process of finding a new drug against a chosen target for a particular disease usually involves high throughput screening hts wherein large libraries of chemicals are tested for their ability to modify the target for example if the target is a novel gpcr compounds will be screened for their ability to inhibit or stimulate that receptor see antagonist and agonist if the target is a protein kinase the chemicals will be tested for their ability to inhibit that kinase another important function of hts is to show how selective the compounds are for the chosen target the ideal is to find a molecule which will interfere with only the chosen target but not other related targets to this end other screening runs will be made to see whether the hits against the chosen target will interfere with other related targets this is the process of cross screening cross screening is important because the more unrelated targets a compound hits the more likely that off target toxicity will occur with that compound once it reaches the clinic it is very unlikely that a perfect drug candidate will emerge from these early screening runs it is more often observed that several compounds are found to have some degree of activity and if these compounds share common chemical features one or more pharmacophores can then be developed at this point medicinal chemists will attempt to use structure activity relationships sar to improve certain features of the lead compound increase activity against the chosen target reduce activity against unrelated targets improve the druglikeness or adme properties of the molecule this process will require several iterative screening runs during which it is hoped the properties of the new molecular entities will improve and allow the favoured compounds to go forward to in vitro and in vivo testing for activity in the disease model of choice amongst the physico chemical properties associated with drug absorption include ionization pka and solubility permeability can be determined by pampa and caco 2 pampa is attractive as an early screen due to the low consumption of drug and the low cost compared to tests such as caco 2 gastrointestinal tract git and blood brain barrier bbb with which there is a high correlation a range of parameters can be used to assess the quality of a compound or a series of compounds as proposed in the lipinski s rule of five such parameters include calculated properties such as clogp to estimate lipophilicity molecular weight polar surface area and measured properties such as potency in vitro measurement of enzymatic clearance etc some descriptors such as ligand efficiency 4 le and lipophilic efficiency 5 6 lipe combine such parameters to assess druglikeness while hts is a commonly used method for novel drug discovery it is not the only method it is often possible to start from a molecule which already has some of the desired properties such a molecule might be extracted from a natural product or even be a drug on the market which could be improved upon so called me too drugs other methods such as virtual high throughput screening where screening is done using computer generated models and attempting to dock virtual libraries to a target are also often used another important method for drug discovery is drug design whereby the biological and physical properties of the target are studied and a prediction is made of the sorts of chemicals that might e g fit into an active site one example is fragment based lead discovery fbld novel pharmacophores can emerge very rapidly from these exercises in general computer aided drug design is often but not always used to try to improve the potency and properties of new drug leads once a lead compound series has been established with sufficient target potency and selectivity and favourable drug like properties one or two compounds will then be proposed for drug development the best of these is generally called the lead compound while the other will be designated as the backup edit historical background the idea that effect of drug in human body are mediated by specific interactions of the drug molecule with biological macromolecules proteins or nucleic acids in most cases led scientists to the conclusion that individual chemicals are required for the biological activity of the drug this made for the beginning of the modern era in pharmacology as pure chemicals instead of crude extracts became the standard drugs examples of drug compounds isolated from crude preparations are morphine the active agent in opium and digoxin a heart stimulant originating from digitalis lanata organic chemistry also led to the synthesis of many of the cochemicals isolated from biological sources edit nature as source of drugs despite the rise of combinatorial chemistry as an integral part of lead discovery process natural products still play a major role as starting material for drug discovery 7 a report was published in 2007 8 covering years 1981 2006 details the contribution of biologically occurring chemicals in drug development according to this report of the 974 small molecule new chemical entities 63 were natural derived or semisynthetic derivatives of natural products for certain therapy areas such as antimicrobials antineoplastics antihypertensive and anti inflammatory drugs the numbers were higher in many cases these products have been used traditionally for many years natural products may be useful as a source of novel chemical structures for modern techniques of development of antibacterial therapies 9 despite the implied potential only a fraction of earth s living species has been tested for bioactivity edit plant derived prior to paracelsus the vast majority of traditionally used crude drugs in western medicine were plant derived extracts this has resulted in a pool of information about the potential of plant species as an important source of starting material for drug discovery a different set of metabolites is sometimes produced in the different anatomical parts of the plant e g root leaves and flower and botanical knowledge is crucial also for the correct identification of bioactive plant materials edit microbial metabolites main article medicinal molds microbes compete for living space and nutrients to survive in these conditions many microbes have developed abilities to prevent competing species from proliferating microbes are the main source of antimicrobial drugs streptomyces species have been a valuable source of antibiotics the classical example of an antibiotic discovered as a defense mechanism against another microbe is the discovery of penicillin in bacterial cultures contaminated by penicillium fungi in 1928 edit marine invertebrates marine environments are potential sources for new bioactive agents 10 arabinose nucleosides discovered from marine invertebrates in 1950s demonstrating for the first time that sugar moieties other than ribose and deoxyribose can yield bioactive nucleoside structures however it was 2004 when the first marine derived drug was approved the cone snail toxin ziconotide also known as prialt was approved by the food and drug administration to treat severe neuropathic pain several other marine derived agents are now in clinical trials for indications such as cancer anti inflammatory use and pain one class of these agents are bryostatin like compounds under investigation as anti cancer therapy edit chemical diversity of natural products as above mentioned combinatorial chemistry was a key technology enabling the efficient generation of large screening libraries for the needs of high throughput screening however now after two decades of combinatorial chemistry it has been pointed out that despite the increased efficiency in chemical synthesis no increase in lead or drug candidates has been reached 8 this has led to analysis of chemical characteristics of combinatorial chemistry products compared to existing drugs or natural products the chemoinformatics concept chemical diversity depicted as distribution of compounds in the chemical space based on their physicochemical characteristics is often used to describe the difference between the combinatorial chemistry libraries and natural products the synthetic combinatorial library compounds seem to cover only a limited and quite uniform chemical space whereas existing drugs and particularly natural products exhibit much greater chemical diversity distributing more evenly to the chemical space 7 the most prominent differences between natural products and compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries is the number of chiral centers much higher in natural compounds structure rigidity higher in natural compounds and number of aromatic moieties higher in combinatorial chemistry libraries other chemical differences between these two groups include the nature of heteroatoms o and n enriched in natural products and s and halogen atoms more often present in synthetic compounds as well as level of non aromatic unsaturation higher in natural products as both structure rigidity and chirality are both well established factors in medicinal chemistry known to enhance compounds specificity and efficacy as a drug it has been suggested that natural products compare favourable to today s combinatorial chemistry libraries as potential lead molecules edit natural product drug discovery edit screening two main approaches exist for the finding of new bioactive chemical entities from natural sources the first is sometimes referred to as random collection and screening of material but in fact the collection is often far from random in that biological often botanical knowledge is used about which families show promise based on a number of factors including past screening this approach is based on the fact that only a small part of earth s biodiversity has ever been tested for pharmaceutical activity it is also based on the fact that organisms living in a species rich environment need to evolve defensive and competitive mechanisms to survive mechanisms which might usefully be exploited in the development of drugs that can cure diseases affecting humans a collection of plant animal and microbial samples from rich ecosystems can potentially give rise to novel biological activities worth exploiting in the drug development process one example of a successful use of this strategy is the screening for antitumour agents by the national cancer institute started in the 1960s paclitaxel was identified from pacific yew tree taxus brevifolia paclitaxel showed anti tumour activity by a previously undescribed mechanism stabilization of microtubules and is now approved for clinical use for the treatment of lung breast and ovarian cancer as well as for kaposi s sarcoma early in the 21st century cabazitaxel made by sanofi a french firm another relative of taxol has been shown effective against prostate cancer also because it works by preventing the formation of microtubules which pull the chromosomes apart in dividing cells such as cancer cells still another examples are 1 camptotheca camptothecin topotecan irinotecan rubitecan belotecan 2 podophyllum etoposide teniposide 3a anthracyclines aclarubicin daunorubicin doxorubicin epirubicin idarubicin amrubicin pirarubicin valrubicin zorubicin 3b anthracenediones mitoxantrone pixantrone nor do all drugs developed in this manner come from plants professor louise rollins smith of vanderbilt university s medical center for example has developed from the skin of frogs a compound which blocks aids professor rollins smith is aware of declining amphibian populations and has said we need to protect these species long enough for us to understand their medicinal cabinet the second main approach involves ethnobotany the study of the general use of plants in society and ethnopharmacology an area inside ethnobotany which is focused specifically on medicinal uses both of these two main approaches can be used in selecting starting materials for future drugs artemisinin an antimalarial agent from sweet wormtree artemisia annua used in chinese medicine since 200bc is one drug used as part of combination therapy for multiresistant plasmodium falciparum edit structural elucidation the elucidation of the chemical structure is critical to avoid the re discovery of a chemical agent that is already known for its structure and chemical activity mass spectrometry often used to determine structure is a method in which individual compounds are identified based on their mass charge ratio after ionization chemical compounds exist in nature as mixtures so the combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry lc ms is often used to separate the individual chemicals databases of mass spectras for known compounds are available nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is another important technique for determining chemical structures of natural products nmr yields information about individual hydrogen and carbon atoms in the structure allowing detailed reconstruction of the molecule s
