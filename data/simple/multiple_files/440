personal information management pim refers to the practice and the study of the activities people perform in order to acquire organize maintain retrieve and use personal information items such as documents paper based and digital web pages and email messages for everyday use to complete tasks work related or not and fulfill a person s various roles as parent employee friend member of community etc one ideal of pim is that we always have the right information in the right place in the right form and of sufficient completeness and quality to meet our current need technologies and tools such as personal information managers help us spend less time with time consuming and error prone activities of pim such as looking for information we then have more time to make creative intelligent use of the information at hand in order to get things done or to simply enjoy the information itself contents 1 history and background 2 tools 3 study 4 related activities and areas 4 1 cognitive

prominence in the 1980s as a way to define rules to drive expert systems a seminal paper in personal information management research is finding and reminding by barreau and nardi in 1995 1 it shows how ethographic field studies can be used to derive testable theories for improving personal information management practices and tools many publications by others followed until a workshop series was initiated with the first nsf sponsored workshop on pim held in seattle washington on january 27 29 2005 the group gathered at this workshop started defining the field in a published report 2 this report formed the basis of the book personal information management and follow up workshops research in the area of pim also relates to work done under the term personal knowledge management whereas the focus there is on philosophy and integration with the theories created within knowledge management a holistic approach the focus of pim research is on collecting statistically relevant data to support the core hypothesis of pim see for example the work of steve whittaker and on creating and validating tools for pim see works by william jones or david karger edit tools there are a number of tools available for managing personal information but these tools can become a part of the problem leading to information fragmentation different devices and applications often come with their separate ways of storing and organizing information note many people confuse pim tools with the study and practice of personal information management itself see personal information manager for information about tools for personal information management edit study interest in the study of pim has increased in recent years one goal in the study of pim is to identify ways to introduce new tool support without inadvertently increasing the complexity of a person s information management challenge the study of pim means understanding better how people manage information across tools and over time it is not enough simply to study for example e mail use in isolation a related point is that the value of a new tool must be assessed over time and in a broader context of a person s various pim activities edit related activities and areas pim shares considerable potentially synergistic overlap with disciplines such as cognitive science human computer interaction information science artificial intelligence database management and information retrieval pim relates to but differs from other fields of inquiry that study the interactions between people information and technology edit cognitive psychology and cognitive science cognitive psychology as the study of how people learn and remember problem solve and make decisions necessarily also includes the study of how people make smart use of available information the related field of cognitive science in its efforts to apply these questions more broadly to the study and simulation of intelligent behavior is also related to pim cognitive science has strong connections to some would say subsumes the field of artificial intelligence there is great potential for a mutually beneficial interplay between cognitive science and pim sub areas of cognitive science of clear relevance to pim include problem solving and decision making for example folders created to hold information for a big project such as plan my wedding may sometimes resemble a problem decomposition 3 to take another example signal detection task 4 has long been used to frame and explain human behavior and has recently been used as a basis for analyzing our choices concerning what information to keep and how a key activity of pim 5 or consider categorization and concept formation how are categories and concepts learned and used categories and concepts can be seen directly but may be reflected in the tags and folders people use to organize their information or consider the activities of reading and writing both are areas of study in cognitive psychology with clear relevance to the study of pim now large portions of a document may be the product of copy and paste operations from our previous writings rather than a product of original writing certainly management of text pieces pasted for re use is a pim activity and this raises several interesting questions how do we go about deciding when to re use and when to write from scratch we may sometimes spend more time chasing down a paragraph we have previously written than it would have taken to simply write a new paragraph expressing the same thoughts beyond this we can wonder at what point a reliance on an increasing and increasingly available supply of previously written material begins to impact our creativity as people do pim they work in an external environment that includes other people available technology and organizational setting this means that situated cognition distributed cognition and social cognition all relate to the study of pim edit human computer and human information interaction the study of pim is also related to the field of human computer interaction hci but pim research puts emphasis on the broader study of how people manage their information over time using a variety of tools some computer based some not the user subjective approach is the first approach dedicated specifically to pim systems design its theoretical foundations were first published in a journal of the american society for information science and technology paper in 2003 6 another jasist paper with evidence and implementation for the approach was published in 2008 7 the paper had won the best jasist paper award in 2009 8 the first user subjective design scheme was developed and positively evaluated in a conference on human factors in computing systems paper published in 2009 9 edit management of data information knowledge time and tasks the study of information management and knowledge management in organizations relates to the study of pim jones notes that issues seen first at an organizational level often migrate to the pim domain 10 pim can help to motivate and will also benefit from work in information retrieval and database management for example data mining techniques might be applied to mine and structure personal information edit relation to time management and productivity by similar argument a discussion of time management or task management on a personal level quickly takes us back to a discussion of pim both time and task management make heavy use of information tools and external forms of information such as to do lists calendars timelines gantt charts etc this information to be managed like other information what are we really managing information is a means to an end not always not for everyone but mostly information is rarely even a very precious resource we usually have far too much of it even a document we have spent days or weeks writing is typically available in multiple locations and sometimes confusingly in multiple versions we manage our information so that we can manage our lives we manage information for what it represents our world alternatives and the means for effecting change in this world information represents alternatives alternate hotels alternate life journeys information represents the means for change information to make the hotel reservation information concerning how to practice zen and where citation needed even if information itself is rarely a precious asset we manage information because information is the most visible tangible way to manage other resources that are precious in 1971 herbert simon nobel laureate in economics elegantly expressed this point with respect to the resource of attention what information consumes is rather obvious it consumes the attention of its recipients hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it p 40 this quote still rings true if we replace attention with time energy or well being certainly the nagging presence of papers representing unpaid bills unanswered email or unfiled documents can distract enervate and demoralize we can t see our well being our attention or our energy or even our time but we can see and manage our paper documents our e documents our email messages our digital calendars and other forms of information it is through the management of these personal information items that we seek to manage the precious resources of our lives
