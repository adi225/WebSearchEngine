160 gb sdlt tape cartridge an example of off line storage when used within a robotic tape library it is classified as tertiary storage instead computer data storage often called storage or memory is a technology consisting of computer components and recording media used to retain digital data it is a core function and fundamental component of computers in contemporary usage memory is usually semiconductor storage read write random access memory typically dram dynamic ram or other forms of fast but temporary storage storage consists of storage devices and their media not directly accessible by the cpu secondary or tertiary storage typically hard disk drives optical disc drives and other devices slower than ram but are non volatile retaining contents when powered down 1 historically memory has been called core main memory real storage or internal memory while storage devices have been referred to as secondary storage external memory or auxiliary peripheral storage the distinctions are fundamental to the architecture of computers the distinctions also reflect an important and significant technical difference between memory and mass storage devices which has been blurred by the historical usage of the term storage nevertheless this article uses the traditional nomenclature many different forms of storage based on various natural phenomena have been invented so far no practical universal storage medium exists and all forms of storage have some drawbacks therefore a computer system usually contains several kinds of storage each with an individual purpose a modern digital computer represents data using the binary numeral system text numbers pictures audio and nearly any other form of information can be converted into a string of bits or binary digits each of which has a value of 1 or 0 the most common unit of storage is the byte equal to 8 bits a piece of information can be handled by any computer or device whose storage space is large enough to accommodate the binary representation of the piece of information or simply data for example the complete works of shakespeare about 1250 pages in print can be stored in about five megabytes 40 million bits with one byte per character the defining component of a computer is the central processing unit cpu or simply processor because it operates on data performs computations and controls other components in the most commonly used computer architecture the cpu consists of two main parts control unit and arithmetic logic unit alu the former controls the flow of data between the cpu and memory the latter performs arithmetic and logical operations on data without a significant amount of memory a computer would merely be able to perform fixed operations and immediately output the result it would have to be reconfigured to change its behavior this is acceptable for devices such as desk calculators digital signal processors and other specialised devices von neumann machines differ in having a memory in which they store their operating instructions and data such computers are more versatile in that they do not need to have their hardware reconfigured for each new program but can simply be reprogrammed with new in memory instructions they also tend to be simpler to design in that a relatively simple processor may keep state between successive computations to build up complex procedural results most modern computers are von neumann machines in practice almost all computers use a variety of memory types organized in a storage hierarchy around the cpu as a trade off between performance and cost generally the lower a storage is in the hierarchy the lesser its bandwidth and the greater its access latency is from the cpu this traditional division of storage to primary secondary tertiary and off line storage is also guided by cost per bit contents 1 hierarchy of storage 1 1 primary storage 1 2 secondary storage 1 3 tertiary storage 1 4 off line storage 2

general purpose computer are arithmetic and logic unit control circuitry storage space and input output devices technology and capacity as in common home computers around 2005 see also memory hierarchy edit primary storage direct links to this section primary storage main memory internal memory main article computer memory primary storage or main memory or internal memory often referred to simply as memory is the only one directly accessible to the cpu the cpu continuously reads instructions stored there and executes them as required any data actively operated on is also stored there in uniform manner historically early computers used delay lines williams tubes or rotating magnetic drums as primary storage by 1954 those unreliable methods were mostly replaced by magnetic core memory core memory remained dominant until the 1970s when advances in integrated circuit technology allowed semiconductor memory to become economically competitive this led to modern random access memory ram it is small sized light but quite expensive at the same time the particular types of ram used for primary storage are also volatile i e they lose the information when not powered as shown in the diagram traditionally there are two more sub layers of the primary storage besides main large capacity ram processor registers are located inside the processor each register typically holds a word of data often 32 or 64 bits cpu instructions instruct the arithmetic and logic unit to perform various calculations or other operations on this data or with the help of it registers are the fastest of all forms of computer data storage processor cache is an intermediate stage between ultra fast registers and much slower main memory it s introduced solely to increase performance of the computer most actively used information in the main memory is just duplicated in the cache memory which is faster but of much lesser capacity on the other hand main memory is much slower but has a much greater storage capacity than processor registers multi level hierarchical cache setup is also commonly used primary cache being smallest fastest and located inside the processor secondary cache being somewhat larger and slower main memory is directly or indirectly connected to the central processing unit via a memory bus it is actually two buses not on the diagram an address bus and a data bus the cpu firstly sends a number through an address bus a number called memory address that indicates the desired location of data then it reads or writes the data itself using the data bus additionally a memory management unit mmu is a small device between cpu and ram recalculating the actual memory address for example to provide an abstraction of virtual memory or other tasks as the ram types used for primary storage are volatile cleared at start up a computer containing only such storage would not have a source to read instructions from in order to start the computer hence non volatile primary storage containing a small startup program bios is used to bootstrap the computer that is to read a larger program from non volatile secondary storage to ram and start to execute it a non volatile technology used for this purpose is called rom for read only memory the terminology may be somewhat confusing as most rom types are also capable of random access many types of rom are not literally read only as updates are possible however it is slow and memory must be erased in large portions before it can be re written some embedded systems run programs directly from rom or similar because such programs are rarely changed standard computers do not store non rudimentary programs in rom rather use large capacities of secondary storage which is non volatile as well and not as costly recently primary storage and secondary storage in some uses refer to what was historically called respectively secondary storage and tertiary storage 2 edit secondary storage a hard disk drive with protective cover removed secondary storage also known as external memory or auxiliary storage differs from primary storage in that it is not directly accessible by the cpu the computer usually uses its input output channels to access secondary storage and transfers the desired data using intermediate area in primary storage secondary storage does not lose the data when the device is powered down it is non volatile per unit it is typically also two orders of magnitude less expensive than primary storage consequently modern computer systems typically have two orders of magnitude more secondary storage than primary storage and data are kept for a longer time there in modern computers hard disk drives are usually used as secondary storage the time taken to access a given byte of information stored on a hard disk is typically a few thousandths of a second or milliseconds by contrast the time taken to access a given byte of information stored in random access memory is measured in billionths of a second or nanoseconds this illustrates the significant access time difference which distinguishes solid state memory from rotating magnetic storage devices hard disks are typically about a million times slower than memory rotating optical storage devices such as cd and dvd drives have even longer access times with disk drives once the disk read write head reaches the proper placement and the data of interest rotates under it subsequent data on the track are very fast to access to reduce the seek time and rotational latency data are transferred to and from disks in large contiguous blocks when data reside on disk block access to hide latency offers a ray of hope in designing efficient external memory algorithms sequential or block access on disks is orders of magnitude faster than random access and many sophisticated paradigms have been developed to design efficient algorithms based upon sequential and block access another way to reduce the i o bottleneck is to use multiple disks in parallel in order to increase the bandwidth between primary and secondary memory 3 some other examples of secondary storage technologies are flash memory e g usb flash drives or keys floppy disks magnetic tape paper tape punched cards standalone ram disks and iomega zip drives the secondary storage is often formatted according to a file system format which provides the abstraction necessary to organize data into files and directories providing also additional information called metadata describing the owner of a certain file the access time the access permissions and other information most computer operating systems use the concept of virtual memory allowing utilization of more primary storage capacity than is physically available in the system as the primary memory fills up the system moves the least used chunks pages to secondary storage devices to a swap file or page file retrieving them later when they are needed as more of these retrievals from slower secondary storage are necessary the more the overall system performance is degraded edit tertiary storage large tape library tape cartridges placed on shelves in the front robotic arm moving in the back visible height of the library is about 180 cm tertiary storage or tertiary memory 4 provides a third level of storage typically it involves a robotic mechanism which will mount insert and dismount removable mass storage media into a storage device according to the system s demands these data are often copied to secondary storage before use it is primarily used for archiving rarely accessed information since it is much slower than secondary storage e g 5 60 seconds vs 1 10 milliseconds this is primarily useful for extraordinarily large data stores accessed without human operators typical examples include tape libraries and optical jukeboxes when a computer needs to read information from the tertiary storage it will first consult a catalog database to determine which tape or disc contains the information next the computer will instruct a robotic arm to fetch the medium and place it in a drive when the computer has finished reading the information the robotic arm will return the medium to its place in the library edit off line storage off line storage is a computer data storage on a medium or a device that is not under the control of a processing unit 5 the medium is recorded usually in a secondary or tertiary storage device and then physically removed or disconnected it must be inserted or connected by a human operator before a computer can access it again unlike tertiary storage it cannot be accessed without human interaction off line storage is used to transfer information since the detached medium can be easily physically transported additionally in case a disaster for example a fire destroys the original data a medium in a remote location will probably be unaffected enabling disaster recovery off line storage increases general information security since it is physically inaccessible from a computer and data confidentiality or integrity cannot be affected by computer based attack techniques also if the information stored for archival purposes is rarely accessed off line storage is less expensive than tertiary storage in modern personal computers most secondary and tertiary storage media are also used for off line storage optical discs and flash memory devices are most popular and to much lesser extent removable hard disk drives in enterprise uses magnetic tape is predominant older examples are floppy disks zip disks or punched cards edit characteristics of storage a 1gb ddr ram module detail storage technologies at all levels of the storage hierarchy can be differentiated by evaluating certain core characteristics as well as measuring characteristics specific to a particular implementation these core characteristics are volatility mutability accessibility and addressibility for any particular implementation of any storage technology the characteristics worth measuring are capacity and performance edit volatility non volatile memory will retain the stored information even if it is not constantly supplied with electric power it is suitable for long term storage of information volatile memory requires constant power to maintain the stored information the fastest memory technologies of today are volatile ones not a universal rule since primary storage is required to be very fast it predominantly uses volatile memory dynamic random access memory a form of volatile memory which also requires the stored information to be periodically re read and re written or refreshed otherwise it would vanish static random access memory a form of volatile memory similar to dram with the exception that it never needs to be refreshed as long as power is applied it loses its content if power is removed edit mutability read write storage or mutable storage 160 allows information to be overwritten at any time a computer without some amount of read write storage for primary storage purposes would be useless for many tasks modern computers typically use read write storage also for secondary storage read only storage 160 retains the information stored at the time of manufacture and write once storage write once read many allows the information to be written only once at some point after manufacture these are called immutable storage immutable storage is used for tertiary and off line storage examples include cd rom and cd r slow write fast read storage 160 read write storage which allows information to be overwritten multiple times but with the write operation being much slower than the read operation examples include cd rw and flash memory edit accessibility random access any location in storage can be accessed at any moment in approximately the same amount of time such characteristic is well suited for primary and secondary storage most semiconductor memories and disk drives provide random access sequential access the accessing of pieces of information will be in a serial order one after the other therefore the time to access a particular piece of information depends upon which piece of information was last accessed such characteristic is typical of off line storage edit addressability location addressable 160 each individually accessible unit of information in storage is selected with its numerical memory address in modern computers location addressable storage usually limits to primary storage accessed internally by computer programs since location addressability is very efficient but burdensome for humans file addressable information is divided into files of variable length and a particular file is selected with human readable directory and file names the underlying device is still location addressable but the operating system of a computer provides the file system abstraction to make the operation more understandable in modern computers secondary tertiary and off line storage use file systems content addressable each individually accessible unit of information is selected based on the basis of part of the contents stored there content addressable storage can be implemented using software computer program or hardware computer device with hardware being faster but more expensive option hardware content addressable memory is often used in a computer s cpu cache cas content addressable storage addresses the thinking behind how are we to find and access the information that we currently have or will gather in the future edit capacity raw capacity 160 the total amount of stored information that a storage device or medium can hold it is expressed as a quantity of bits or bytes e g 10 4 megabytes memory storage density the compactness of stored information it is the storage capacity of a medium divided with a unit of length area or volume e g 1 2 megabytes per square inch edit performance latency the time it takes to access a particular location in storage the relevant unit of measurement is typically nanosecond for primary storage millisecond for secondary storage and second for tertiary storage it may make sense to separate read latency and write latency and in case of sequential access storage minimum maximum and average latency throughput the rate at which information can be read from or written to the storage in computer data storage throughput is usually expressed in terms of megabytes per second or mb s though bit rate may also be used as with latency read rate and write rate may need to be differentiated also accessing media sequentially as opposed to randomly typically yields maximum throughput edit energy use storage devices that reduce fan usage automatically shut down during inactivity and low power hard drives can reduce energy consumption 90 percent 6 2 5 inch hard disk drives often consume less power than larger ones 7 8 low capacity solid state drives have no moving parts and consume less power than hard disks 9 10 11 also memory may use more power than hard disks 11 edit fundamental storage technologies as of 2011 update the most commonly used data storage technologies are semiconductor magnetic and optical while paper still sees some limited usage media is a common name for what actually holds the data in the storage device some other fundamental storage technologies have also been used in the past or are proposed for development edit semiconductor semiconductor memory uses semiconductor based integrated circuits to store information a semiconductor memory chip may contain millions of tiny transistors or capacitors both volatile and non volatile forms of semiconductor memory exist in modern computers primary storage almost exclusively consists of dynamic volatile semiconductor memory or dynamic random access memory since the turn of the century a type of non volatile semiconductor memory known as flash memory has steadily gained share as off line storage for home computers non volatile semiconductor memory is also used for secondary storage in various advanced electronic devices and specialized computers as early as 2006 notebook and desktop computer manufacturers started using flash based solid state drives ssds as default configuration options for the secondary storage either in addition to or instead of the more traditional hdd 12 13 14 15 16 edit magnetic v t e magnetic storage media wire 1898 tape 1928 drum 1932 ferrite core 1949 hard disk 1956 stripe card 1956 micr 1956 thin film

so that the head or medium or both must be moved relative to another in order to access data in modern computers magnetic storage will take these forms magnetic disk floppy disk used for off line

particularly before general purpose computers existed information was recorded by punching holes into the paper or cardboard medium and was read mechanically or later optically to determine whether a particular location on the medium was solid or contained a hole a few technologies allow people to make marks on paper that are easily read by machine these are widely used for tabulating votes and grading standardized tests barcodes made it possible for any object that was to be sold or transported to have some computer readable information securely attached to it edit uncommon vacuum tube memory 160 a williams tube used a cathode ray tube and a selectron tube used a large vacuum tube to store information these primary storage devices were short lived in the market since williams tube was unreliable and the selectron tube was expensive electro acoustic memory 160 delay line memory used sound waves in a substance such as mercury to store information delay line memory was dynamic volatile cycle sequential read write storage and was used for primary storage optical tape is a medium for optical storage generally consisting of a long and narrow strip of plastic onto which patterns can be written and from which the patterns can be read back it shares some technologies with cinema film stock and optical discs but is compatible with neither the motivation behind developing this technology was the possibility of far greater storage capacities than either magnetic tape or optical discs phase change memory uses different mechanical phases of phase change material to store information in an x y addressable matrix and reads the information by observing the varying electrical resistance of the material phase change memory would be non volatile random access read write storage and might be used for primary secondary and off line storage most rewritable and many write once optical disks already use phase change material to store information holographic data storage stores information optically inside crystals or photopolymers holographic storage can utilize the whole volume of the storage medium unlike optical disc storage which is limited to a small number of surface layers holographic storage would be non volatile sequential access and either write once or read write storage it might be used for secondary and off line storage see holographic versatile disc hvd molecular memory stores information in polymer that can store electric charge molecular memory might be especially suited for primary storage the theoretical storage capacity of molecular memory is 10 terabits per square inch 18 edit related technologies edit network connectivity a secondary or tertiary storage may connect to a computer utilizing computer networks this concept does not pertain to the primary storage which is shared between multiple processors in a much lesser degree direct attached storage das is a traditional mass storage that does not use any network this is still a most popular approach this retronym was coined recently together with nas and san network attached storage nas is mass storage attached to a computer which another computer can access at file level over a local area network a private wide area network or in the case of online file storage over the internet nas is commonly associated with the nfs and cifs smb protocols storage area network san is a specialized network that provides other computers with storage capacity the crucial difference between nas and san is the former presents and manages file systems to client computers whilst the latter provides access at block addressing raw level leaving it to attaching systems to manage data or file systems within the provided capacity san is commonly associated with fibre channel networks edit robotic storage large quantities of individual magnetic tapes and optical or magneto optical discs may be stored in robotic tertiary storage devices in tape storage field they are known as tape libraries and in optical storage field optical jukeboxes or optical disk libraries per analogy smallest forms of either technology containing just one drive device are referred to as autoloaders or autochangers robotic access storage devices may have a number of slots each holding individual media and usually one or more picking robots that traverse the slots and load media to built in drives the arrangement of the slots and picking devices affects performance important characteristics of such storage are possible expansion options adding slots modules drives robots tape libraries may have from 10 to more than 100 000 slots and provide terabytes or petabytes of near line information optical jukeboxes are somewhat smaller solutions up to 1 000 slots robotic storage is used for backups and for high capacity archives in imaging medical and video industries hierarchical storage management is a most known archiving strategy of automatically migrating long
