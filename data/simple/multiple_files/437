for other uses see pattern disambiguation tilings such as these from igreja de campanh porto portugal are visual patterns used for decoration a pattern apart from the term s use to mean template a is a discernible regularity in the world or in a manmade design as such the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner any of the five senses may directly observe patterns conversely abstract patterns in science mathematics or language may be observable only by analysis direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns which are widespread in nature and in art visual patterns in nature are often chaotic never exactly repeating and often involve fractals natural patterns include spirals meanders waves foams tilings cracks and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection all such patterns have an underlying mathematical structure indeed mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern similarly in the sciences theories explain and predict regularities in the world in art and architecture decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer in computer science a software design pattern is a known solution to a class of problems in programming contents 1 nature 1 1 symmetry 1 2 spirals 1 3 chaos flow meanders 1 4

nature nature provides examples of many kinds of pattern including symmetries trees and other structures with a fractal dimension spirals meanders waves foams tilings cracks and stripes 1 edit symmetry snowflake sixfold symmetry symmetry is widespread in living things animals that move usually have bilateral or mirror symmetry as this favours movement 2 plants often have radial or rotational symmetry as do many flowers as well as animals which are largely static as adults such as sea anemones fivefold symmetry is found in the echinoderms including starfish sea urchins and sea lilies 3 among non living things snowflakes have striking sixfold symmetry each flake is unique its structure recording the varying conditions during its crystallisation similarly on each of its six arms 4 crystals have a highly specific set of possible crystal symmetries they can be cubic or octahedral but cannot have fivefold symmetry unlike quasicrystals 5 edit spirals aloe polyphylla phyllotaxis spiral patterns are found in the body plans of animals including molluscs such as the nautilus and in the phyllotaxis of many plants both of leaves spiralling around stems and in the multiple spirals found in flowerheads such as the sunflower and fruit structures like the pineapple 6 edit chaos flow meanders vortex street turbulence chaos theory predicts that while the laws of physics are deterministic events and patterns in nature never exactly repeat because extremely small differences in starting conditions can lead to widely differing outcomes 7 many natural patterns are shaped by this apparent randomness including vortex streets 8 and other effects of turbulent flow such as meanders in rivers 9 edit waves dunes dune ripple waves are disturbances that carry energy as they move mechanical waves propagate through a medium air or water making it oscillate as they pass by 10 wind waves are surface waves that create the chaotic patterns of the sea as they pass over sand such waves create patterns of ripples similarly as the wind passes over sand it creates patterns of dunes 11 edit bubbles foam foam of soap bubbles foams obey plateau s laws which require films to be smooth and continuous and to have a constant average curvature foam and bubble patterns occur widely in nature for example in radiolarians sponge spicules and the skeletons of silicoflagellates and sea urchins 12 13 edit cracks shrinkage cracks cracks form in materials to relieve stress with 120 degree joints in elastic materials but at 90 degrees in inelastic materials thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not cracking patterns are widespread in nature for example in rocks mud tree bark and the glazes of old paintings and ceramics 14 edit spots stripes giant pufferfish skin alan turing 15 and later the mathematical biologist james murray described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns for example in the skin of mammals or the plumage of birds a reaction diffusion system involving two counter acting chemical mechanisms one that activates and one that inhibits a development such as of dark pigment in the skin 16 these patterns slowly drift the animals appearance changing imperceptibly as turing predicted edit art and architecture elaborate ceramic tiles at topkapi palace further information mathematics and art 160 and 160 mathematics and architecture edit tilings further information tile in visual art pattern consists in regularity which in some way organizes surfaces or structures in a consistent regular manner at its simplest a pattern in art may be a repeating shape in a painting drawing tapestry ceramic tiling or carpet but a pattern need not necessarily repeat exactly as long as it provides some form or organizing skeleton in the artwork 17 edit in architecture patterns in architecture the virupaksha temple at hampi has a fractal like structure where the parts resemble the whole in architecture motifs are repeated in various ways to form patterns most simply structures such as windows can be repeated horizontally and vertically architects can use and repeat decorative and structural elements such as columns pediments and lintels 18 repetitions need not be identical for example temples in south india have a roughly pyramidal form where elements of the pattern repeat in a fractal like way at different sizes 19 edit science and mathematics fractal model of a fern illustrating self similarity mathematics is sometimes called the science of pattern in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed 20 for example any sequence of numbers that may be modeled by a mathematical function can be considered a pattern mathematics can be taught as a collection of patterns 21 edit fractals some mathematical rule patterns can be visualised and among these are those that explain patterns in nature including the mathematics of symmetry waves meanders and fractals fractals are mathematical patterns that are scale invariant this means that the shape of the pattern does not depend on how closely you look at it self similarity is found in fractals examples of natural fractals are coast lines and tree shapes which repeat their shape regardless of what magnification you view at while self similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex the rules needed to describe or produce their formation can be simple e g lindenmayer systems describing tree shapes 22 in pattern theory devised by ulf grenander mathematicians attempt to describe the world in terms of patterns the goal is to lay out the world in a more computationally friendly manner 23 in the broadest sense any regularity that can be explained by a scientific theory is a pattern as in mathematics science can be taught as a set of patterns 24 edit computer science in computer science a software design pattern in the sense of a template is a general solution to a problem in programming a design pattern provides a reusable architectural outline that may speed the development of many computer programs 25 edit see also cellular automata pattern coin pattern formation patterns in nature pattern
