it has been suggested that this article or section be merged into rolap discuss proposed since september 2010 molap stands for m ultidimensional o n l ine a nalytical p rocessing molap is an alternative to the rolap relational olap technology while both rolap and molap analytic tools are designed to allow analysis of data through the use of a multidimensional data model molap differs significantly in that in some software it requires the pre computation and storage of information in the cube the operation known as processing most molap solutions store these data in an optimized multidimensional array storage rather than in a relational database i e in rolap there are many methodologies and algorithms for efficient data storage aggregation and implementation specific business logic with a molap solution as a result there are many misconceptions to what the term specifically implies contents 1 molap vs rolap 1 1 1 advantages of molap 1 2 disadvantages of molap 2 trends 3 products 4 references edit molap vs rolap 1 edit advantages of molap fast query performance due to optimized storage multidimensional indexing and caching smaller on disk size of data compared to data stored in relational database due to compression techniques automated computation of higher level aggregates of the data it is very compact for low dimension data sets array models provide natural indexing effective data extraction achieved through the pre structuring of aggregated data edit disadvantages of molap within some molap solutions the processing step data load can be quite lengthy especially on large data volumes this is usually remedied by doing only incremental processing i e processing only the data which have changed usually new data instead of reprocessing the entire data set molap tools traditionally have difficulty querying models with dimensions with very high cardinality i e millions of members some molap products have difficulty updating and querying models with more than ten dimensions this limit differs depending on the complexity and cardinality of the dimensions in question it also depends on the number of facts or measures stored other molap products can handle hundreds of dimensions some molap methodologies introduce data redundancy edit trends many commercial olap tools now use a hybrid olap holap approach which allows the model designer to decide which portion of the data will be stored in molap edit products examples of commercial products that use molap are cognos powerplay oracle database olap option microstrategy microsoft analysis services essbase tm1 board toolkit lilith hicare and daptech keystone there is also an open source molap server palo not all molap are generic databases some commercial products focus on a specific business function or type such as oracle rpas retail predictive application server 2 edit references bach pedersen torben s jensen christian december 2001 multidimensional database technology distributed systems online ieee 40 46 issn 160 0018 9162 http ieeexplore ieee org stamp stamp jsp arnumber 00970558 retail predictive analysis server user guide december 2012 oracle corporation v t e data warehouse 160 creating the data warehouse concepts database dimension dimensional modeling fact olap star schema aggregate variants anchor modeling column oriented dbms data vault modeling holap molap rolap operational data store elements data dictionary metadata data mart sixth normal form surrogate key fact fact table early arriving fact measure dimension dimension table degenerate slowly changing filling extract transform load etl extract transform load 160 using the data warehouse concepts business intelligence dashboard data mining decision support system dss olap cube languages data mining extensions dmx multidimensional expressions mdx xml for analysis xmla tools business intelligence tools reporting software spreadsheet 160 related people bill inmon ralph kimball products comparison of olap servers data warehousing products and their producers
