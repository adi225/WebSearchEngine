channels that allow sharing of resources and information 1 where at least one process in one device is able to send receive data to from at least one process residing in a remote device then the two devices are said to be in a network a network is a group of devices connected to each other networks may be classified into a wide variety of characteristics the medium used to transport the data

were based upon some type of telecommunications system communication between calculation machines and early computers was performed by human users by carrying instructions between them many of the social behaviors seen in today s internet were demonstrably present in the 19th century and arguably in even earlier networks using visual signals in september 1940 george stibitz used a teletype machine to send instructions for a problem set from his model at dartmouth college to his complex number calculator in new york and received results back by the same means linking output systems like teletypewriters to computers was an interest at the advanced research projects agency arpa when in 1962 j c r licklider was hired and developed a working group he called the intergalactic computer network a precursor to the arpanet early networks of communicating computers included the military radar system semi automatic ground environment sage started in the late 1950s the commercial airline reservation system semi automatic business research environment sabre went online with two connected mainframes in 1960 in 1964 researchers at dartmouth developed the dartmouth time sharing system for distributed users of large computer systems the same year at massachusetts institute of technology a research group supported by general electric and bell labs used a computer to route and manage telephone connections throughout the 1960s leonard kleinrock paul baran and donald davies independently conceptualized and developed network systems which used packets that could be used in a network between computer systems 1965 thomas marill and lawrence g roberts created the first wide area network wan this was an immediate precursor to the arpanet of which roberts became program manager the first widely used telephone switch that used true computer control was introduced by western electric in 1965 in 1969 the university of california at los angeles the stanford research institute university of california at santa barbara and the university of utah were connected as the beginning of the arpanet network using 50 kbit s circuits 2 commercial services using x 25 were deployed in 1972 and later used as an underlying infrastructure for expanding tcp ip networks today computer networks are the core of modern communication all modern aspects of the public switched telephone network pstn are computer controlled and telephony increasingly runs over the internet protocol although not necessarily the public internet the scope of communication has increased significantly in the past decade and this boom in communications would not have been possible without the progressively advancing computer network computer networks and the technology that makes communication between other computers on those networks possible continue to drive computer hardware software and peripherals industries this expansion is mirrored by growth in the numbers and types of users of networks from the researcher to the home user interconnected collection of autonomous computers unique identity is known as computer network edit properties computer networks facilitate communications 160 using a network people can communicate efficiently and easily via email instant messaging chat rooms telephone video telephone calls and video conferencing permit sharing of files data and other types of information in a network environment authorized users may access data and information stored on other computers on the network the capability of providing access to data and information on shared storage devices is an important feature of many networks share network and computing resources in a networked environment each computer on a network may access and use resources provided by devices on the network such as printing a document on a shared network printer distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks may be insecure a computer network may be used by computer hackers to deploy computer viruses or computer worms on devices connected to the network or to prevent these devices from normally accessing the network denial of service may interfere with other technologies power line communication strongly disturbs certain 3 forms of radio communication e g amateur radio it may also interfere with last mile access technologies such as adsl and vdsl may be difficult to set up a complex computer network may be difficult to set up it may also be very costly to set up an effective computer network in a large organization or company edit communication media computer networks can be classified according to the hardware and associated software technology that is used to interconnect the individual devices in the network such as electrical cable homepna power line communication g hn optical fiber and radio waves wireless lan in the osi model these are located at levels 1 and 2 a well known family of communication media is collectively known as ethernet it is defined by ieee 802 and utilizes various standards and media that enable communication between devices wireless lan technology is designed to connect devices without wiring these devices use radio waves or infrared signals as a transmission medium edit wired technologies the order of the following wired technologies are roughly from slowest to fastest transmission speed twisted pair wire is the most widely used medium for telecommunication twisted pair cabling consist of copper wires that are twisted into pairs ordinary telephone wires consist of two insulated copper wires twisted into pairs computer networking cabling wired ethernet as defined by ieee 802 3 consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission the use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction the transmission speed ranges from 2 million bits per second to 10 billion bits per second twisted pair cabling comes in two forms unshielded twisted pair utp and shielded twisted pair stp each form comes in several category ratings designed for use in various scenarios coaxial cable is widely used for cable television systems office buildings and other work sites for local area networks the cables consist of copper or aluminum wire surrounded by an insulating layer typically a flexible material with a high dielectric constant which itself is surrounded by a conductive layer the insulation helps minimize interference and distortion transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second itu t g hn technology uses existing home wiring coaxial cable phone lines and power lines to create a high speed up to 1 gigabit s local area network an optical fiber is a glass fiber it uses pulses of light to transmit data some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are less transmission loss immunity from electromagnetic radiation and very fast transmission speed up to trillions of bits per second one can use different colors of lights to increase the number of messages being sent over a fiber optic cable edit wireless technologies terrestrial microwave 160 terrestrial microwave communication uses earth based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range which limits all communications to line of sight relay stations are spaced approximately 48 160 km 30 160 mi apart communications satellites 160 the satellites communicate via microwave radio waves which are not deflected by the earth s atmosphere the satellites are stationed in space typically in geosynchronous orbit 35 400 160 km 22 000 160 mi above the equator these earth orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice data and tv signals cellular and pcs systems use several radio communications technologies the systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas each area has a low power transmitter or radio relay antenna device to relay calls from one area to the next area radio and spread spectrum technologies 160 wireless local area network use a high frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular and a low frequency radio technology wireless lans use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area ieee 802 11 defines a common flavor of open standards wireless radio wave technology infrared communication can transmit signals for small distances typically no more than 10 meters in most cases line of sight propagation is used which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices a global area network gan is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless lans satellite coverage areas etc the key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next in ieee project 802 this involves a succession of terrestrial wireless lans 4 edit exotic technologies there have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media ip over avian carriers was a humorous april fool s request for comments issued as rfc 1149 it was implemented in real life in 2001 5 extending the internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves 6 both cases have a large round trip delay time which prevents useful communication edit communications protocols and network programming internet map the internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard internet protocol suite tcp ip to serve billions of users worldwide a communications protocol is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network it is typically a protocol stack also see the osi model which is a stack of protocols in which each protocol uses the protocol below it an important example of a protocol stack is http running over tcp over ip over ieee 802 11 tcp and ip are members of the internet protocol suite and ieee 802 11 is a member of the ethernet protocol suite this stack is used between the wireless router and the home user s personal computer when the user is surfing the web communication protocols have various properties such as whether they are connection oriented or connectionless whether they use circuit mode or packet switching or whether they use hierarchical or flat addressing there are many communication protocols a few of which are described below edit ethernet ethernet is a family of protocols used in lans described by a set of standards together called ieee 802 published by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers it has a flat addressing scheme and is mostly situated at levels 1 and 2 of the osi model for home users today the most well known member of this protocol family is ieee 802 11 otherwise known as wireless lan wlan however the complete protocol suite deals with a multitude of networking aspects not only for home use but especially when the technology is deployed to support a diverse range of business needs mac bridging ieee 802 1d deals with the routing of ethernet packets using a spanning tree protocol ieee 802 1q describes vlans and ieee 802 1x defines a port based network access control protocol which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in vlans but it is also found in wlans 160 it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a wireless access key edit internet protocol suite the internet protocol suite often also called tcp ip is the foundation of all modern internetworking it offers connection less as well as connection oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission at the internet protocol ip level at its core the protocol suite defines the addressing identification and routing specification in form of the traditional internet protocol version 4 ipv4 and ipv6 the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability edit sonet sdh synchronous optical networking sonet and synchronous digital hierarchy sdh are standardized multiplexing protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers they were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources primarily to support real time uncompressed circuit switched voice encoded in pcm pulse code modulation format however due to its protocol neutrality and transport oriented features sonet sdh also was the obvious choice for transporting asynchronous transfer mode atm frames edit asynchronous transfer mode asynchronous transfer mode atm is a switching technique for telecommunication networks it uses asynchronous time division multiplexing and encodes data into small fixed sized cells this differs from other protocols such as the internet protocol suite or ethernet that use variable sized packets or frames atm has similarity with both circuit and packet switched networking this makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high throughput data traffic and real time low latency content such as voice and video atm uses a connection oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins while the role of atm is diminishing in favor of next generation networks it still plays a role in the last mile which is the connection between an internet service provider and the home user for an interesting write up of the technologies involved including the deep stacking of communications protocols used see 7 edit network programming computer network programming involves writing computer programs that communicate with each other across a computer network different programs must be written for the client process which initiates the communication and for the server process which waits for the communication to be initiated both endpoints of the communication flow are implemented as network sockets hence network programming is basically socket programming edit scale computer network types by geographical scope near field nfc body ban personal pan near me nan local lan home han storage san campus can backbone metropolitan man wide wan internet interplanetary internet v t e networks are often classified by their physical or organizational extent or their purpose usage trust level and access rights differ between these types of networks edit personal area network a personal area network pan is a computer network used for communication among computer and different information technological devices close to one person 160 indented line examples of devices that are used in a pan personal computers printers fax machines telephones pdas scanners video game consoles 160 indented line pan may include wired devices constructed with usb and firewire connections and wireless devices constructed with bluetooth and infrared communication 160 indented line pan typically extends 10 meters 8 edit local area network a local area network lan is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as home school computer laboratory office building or closely positioned group of buildings each computer or device on the network is a node current wired lans are most likely to be based on ethernet technology although new standards like itu t g hn also provide a way to create a wired lan using existing home wires coaxial cables phone lines and power lines 9 typical library network in a branching tree topology and controlled access to resources a sample lan is depicted in the accompanying diagram all interconnected devices must understand the network layer layer 3 because they are handling multiple subnets the different colors those inside the library which have only 10 100 mbit s ethernet connections to the user device and a gigabit ethernet connection to the central router could be called layer 3 switches because they only have ethernet interfaces and must understand ip it would be more correct to call them access routers where the router at the top is a distribution router that connects to the internet and academic networks customer access routers the defining characteristics of lans in contrast to wans wide area networks include their higher data transfer rates smaller geographic range and no need for leased telecommunication lines current ethernet or other ieee 802 3 lan technologies operate at data transfer rates up to 10 gbit s ieee has projects investigating the standardization of 40 and 100 gbit s 10 lans can be connected to wide area network by using routers edit home area network a home area network han is a residential lan which is used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home usually a small number of personal computers and accessories such as printers and mobile computing devices an important function is the sharing of internet access often a broadband service through a cable tv or digital subscriber line dsl provider edit storage area network a storage area network san is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated block level data storage sans are primarily used to make storage devices such as disk arrays tape libraries and optical jukeboxes accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system a san typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices the cost and complexity of sans dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium sized business environments edit campus area network a campus area network can is a computer network made up of an interconnection of lans within a limited geographical area the networking equipment switches routers and transmission media optical fiber copper plant cat5 cabling etc are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant owner an enterprise university government etc in the case of a university campus based campus network the network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings including for example academic colleges or departments the university library and student residence halls edit backbone network a backbone network is part of a computer network infrastructure that interconnects various pieces of network providing a path for the exchange of information between different lans or subnetworks a backbone can tie together diverse networks in the same building in different buildings in a campus environment or over wide areas normally the backbone s capacity is greater than that of the networks connected to it a large corporation which has many locations may have a backbone network that ties all of these locations together for example a server cluster that needs to be accessed by different departments of a company which are located around the world would benefit from the use of a backbone network the equipment which ties these departments together constitute the network backbone network performance management including network congestion are critical parameters taken into account when designing a network backbone a specific case of a backbone network is the internet backbone which is the set of wide area network connections and core routers that interconnect all networks connected to the internet edit metropolitan area network a metropolitan area network man is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus sample epn made of frame relay wan connections and dialup remote access sample vpn used to interconnect 3 offices and remote users edit wide area network a wide area network wan is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city country or spans even intercontinental distances using a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines cables and air waves a wan often uses transmission facilities provided by common carriers such as telephone companies wan technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the osi reference model the physical layer the data link layer and the network layer edit enterprise private network an enterprise private network is a network built by an enterprise to interconnect various company sites e g production sites head offices remote offices shops in order to share computer resources edit virtual private network a virtual private network vpn is a computer network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network e g the internet instead of by physical wires the data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case one common application is secure communications through the public internet but a vpn need not have explicit security features such as authentication or content encryption vpns for example can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features vpn may have best effort performance or may have a defined service level agreement sla between the vpn customer and the vpn service provider generally a vpn has a topology more complex than point to point edit virtual network not to be confused with a virtual private network a virtual network defines data traffic flows between virtual machines within a hypervisor in a virtual computing environment virtual networks may employ virtual security switches virtual routers virtual firewalls and other virtual networking devices to direct and secure data traffic edit internetwork an internetwork is the connection of multiple computer networks via a common routing technology using routers the internet is an aggregation of many connected internetworks spanning the earth edit organizational scope networks are typically managed by organizations which own them according to the owner s point of view networks are seen as intranets or extranets a special case of network is the internet which has no single owner but a distinct status when seen by an organizational entity 160 that of permitting virtually unlimited global connectivity for a great multitude of purposes edit intranets and extranets intranets and extranets are parts or extensions of a computer network usually a lan an intranet is a set of networks using the internet protocol and ip based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications that are under the control of a single administrative entity that administrative entity closes the intranet to all but specific authorized users most commonly an intranet is the internal network of an organization a large intranet will typically have at least one web server to provide users with organizational information an extranet is a network that is limited in scope to a single organization or entity and also has limited connections to the networks of one or more other usually but not necessarily trusted organizations or entities a company s customers may be given access to some part of its intranet while at the same time the customers may not be considered trusted from a security standpoint technically an extranet may also be categorized as a can man wan or other type of network although an extranet cannot consist of a single lan it must have at least one connection with an external network edit internet the internet is a global system of interconnected governmental academic corporate public and private computer networks it is based on the networking technologies of the internet protocol suite it is the successor of the advanced research projects agency network arpanet developed by darpa of the united states department of defense the internet is also the communications backbone underlying the world wide web www participants in the internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented and often standardized protocols compatible with the internet protocol suite and an addressing system ip addresses administered by the internet assigned numbers authority and address registries service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the reachability of their address spaces through the border gateway protocol bgp forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths edit network topology edit common layouts a network topology is the layout of the interconnections of the nodes of a computer network common layouts are a bus network all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium this was the layout used in the original ethernet called 10base5 and 10base2 a star network all nodes are connected to a special central node this is the typical layout found in a wireless lan where each wireless client connects to the central wireless access point a ring network each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left or rightwards the fiber distributed data interface fddi made use of such a topology a mesh network each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other a fully connected network each node is connected to every other node in the network note that the physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology as an example with fddi the network topology is a ring actually two counter rotating rings but the physical topology is a star because all neighboring connections are routed via a central physical location edit overlay network an overlay network is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network nodes in the overlay are connected by virtual or logical links each of which corresponds to a path perhaps through many physical links in the underlying network the topology of the overlay network may and often does differ from that of the underlying one a sample overlay network ip over sonet over optical for example many peer to peer networks are overlay networks because they are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links run on top of the internet the internet was initially built as an overlay on the telephone network 11 the most striking example of an overlay network however is the internet itself at the network layer each node can reach any other by a direct connection to the desired ip address thereby creating a fully connected network the underlying network however is composed of a mesh like interconnect of subnetworks of varying topologies and in fact technologies address resolution and routing are the means which allows the mapping of the fully connected ip overlay network to the underlying ones overlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over telephone lines using modems before any data network existed another example of an overlay network is a distributed hash table which maps keys to nodes in the network in this case the underlying network is an ip network and the overlay network is a table actually a map indexed by keys overlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve internet routing such as through quality of service guarantees to achieve higher quality streaming media previous proposals such as intserv diffserv and ip multicast have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all routers in the network citation needed on the other hand an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end hosts running the overlay protocol software without cooperation from internet service providers the overlay has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes but it can control for example the sequence of overlay nodes a message traverses before reaching its destination for example akamai technologies manages an overlay network that provides reliable efficient content delivery a kind of multicast academic research includes end system multicast and overcast for multicast ron resilient overlay network for resilient routing and overqos for quality of service guarantees among others edit basic hardware components main article networking hardware apart from the physical communications media themselves as described above networks comprise additional basic hardware building blocks interconnecting their terminals such as network interface cards nics hubs bridges switches and routers edit network interface cards a network card network adapter or nic network interface card is a piece of computer hardware designed to allow computers to physically access a networking medium it provides a low level addressing system through the use of mac addresses each ethernet network interface has a unique mac address which is usually stored in a small memory device on the card allowing any device to connect to the network without creating an address conflict ethernet mac addresses are composed of six octets uniqueness is maintained by the ieee which manages the ethernet address space by assigning 3 octet prefixes to equipment manufacturers the list of prefixes is publicly available each manufacturer is then obliged to both use only their assigned prefix es and to uniquely set the 3 octet suffix of every ethernet interface they produce edit repeaters and hubs a repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal cleans it of unnecessary noise regenerates it and retransmits it at a higher power level or to the other side of an obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation in most twisted pair ethernet configurations repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters a repeater with multiple ports is known as a hub repeaters work on the physical layer of the osi model repeaters require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal this can cause a propagation delay which can affect network communication when there are several repeaters in a row many network architectures limit the number of repeaters that can be used in a row e g ethernet s 5 4 3 rule today repeaters and hubs have been made mostly obsolete by switches see below edit bridges a network bridge connects multiple network segments at the data link layer layer 2 of the osi model bridges broadcast to all ports except the port on which the broadcast was received however bridges do not promiscuously copy traffic to all ports as hubs do but learn which mac addresses are reachable through specific ports once the bridge associates a port and an address it will send traffic for that address to that port only bridges learn the association of ports and addresses by examining the source address of frames that it sees on various ports once a frame arrives through a port its source address is stored and the bridge assumes that mac address is associated with that port the first time that a previously unknown destination address is seen the bridge will forward the frame to all ports other than the one on which the frame arrived bridges come in three basic types local bridges directly connect lans remote bridges can be used to create a wide area network wan link between lans remote bridges where the connecting link is slower than the end networks largely have been replaced with routers wireless bridges can be used to join lans or connect remote stations to lans edit switches a network switch is a device that forwards and filters osi layer 2 datagrams between ports based on the mac addresses in the packets 12 a switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected a switch breaks the collision domain but represents itself as a broadcast domain switches make forwarding decisions of frames on the basis of mac addresses a switch normally has numerous ports facilitating a star topology for devices and cascading additional switches some switches are capable of routing based on layer 3 addressing or additional logical levels these are called multi layer switches the term switch is used loosely in marketing to encompass devices including routers and bridges as well as devices that may distribute traffic on load or by application content e g a web url identifier edit routers a router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by processing information found in the datagram or packet internet protocol information from layer 3 in many situations this information is processed in conjunction with the routing table also known as forwarding table routers use routing tables to determine what interface to forward packets this can include the null also known as the black hole interface because data can go into it however no further processing is done for said data edit firewalls a firewall is an important aspect of a network with respect to security it typically rejects access requests from unsafe sources while allowing actions from recognized ones the vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in cyber attacks for the purpose of stealing corrupting data planting viruses etc edit network performance main article network performance network performance refers to the service quality of a telecommunications product as seen by the customer it should not be seen merely as an attempt to get more through the network the following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit switched network and one type of packet switched network viz atm circuit switched networks in circuit switched networks network performance is synonymous with the grade of service the number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads 13 other types of performance measures can include noise echo and so on atm in an asynchronous transfer mode atm network performance can be measured by line rate quality of service qos data throughput connect time stability technology modulation technique and modem enhancements 14 there are many different ways to measure the performance of a network as each network is different in nature and design performance can also be modelled instead of measured one example of this is using state transition diagrams to model queuing performance in a circuit switched network these diagrams allow the network planner to analyze how the network will perform in each state ensuring that the network will be optimally designed 15 edit network security main article network security in the field of networking the area of network security 16 consists of the provisions and policies adopted by the network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access misuse modification or denial of the computer network and network accessible resources network security is the authorization of access to data in a network which is controlled by the network administrator users are assigned an id and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority network security covers a variety of computer networks both public and private that are used in everyday jobs conducting transactions and communications among businesses government agencies and individuals edit network resilience main article resilience network in computer networking resilience is the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation 17 edit views of networks users and network administrators typically have different views of their networks users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same lan whereas a network administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running a community of interest has less of a connection of being in a local area and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers and possibly also communicate via peer to peer technologies network administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives the physical perspective involves geographic locations physical cabling and the network elements e g routers bridges and application layer gateways that interconnect the physical media logical networks called in the tcp ip architecture subnets map onto one or more physical media for example a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of lan cables in each building appear to be a common subnet using virtual lan vlan technology both users and administrators will be aware to varying extents of the trust and scope characteristics of a network again using tcp ip architectural terminology an intranet is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise and is only accessible by authorized users e g employees 18 intranets do not have to be connected to the internet but generally have a limited connection an extranet is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet e g business partners customers 18 unofficially the internet is the set of users enterprises and content providers that are interconnected by internet service providers isp from an engineering viewpoint the internet is the set of subnets and aggregates of subnets which share the registered ip address space and exchange information about the reachability of those ip addresses using the border gateway protocol typically the human readable names of servers are translated to ip addresses transparently to users via the directory function of the domain name system dns over the internet there can be business to business b2b business to consumer b2c and consumer to consumer c2c communications especially when money or sensitive information is exchanged the communications are apt to be secured by some form of communications security mechanism intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the internet without any access by general internet users and administrators using secure
