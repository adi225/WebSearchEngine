traditionally ir tools have been designed for ir professionals to enable them to effectively and efficiently retrieve information from a source it is assumed that the information exists in the source and that a well formed query will retrieve it and nothing else it has been argued that laypersons information seeking on the web is very different from information retrieval as performed within the ir discourse yet web search engines are built on ir principles since the late 1990s a body of research on how casual users interact with web search engines has been forming but the topic is far from fully understood ir can be said to be technology oriented focusing on algorithms and issues such as precision and recall information seeking may be understood as a more human oriented and open ended process than information retrieval in information seeking one does not know whether there exists an answer to one s query so the process of seeking may provide the learning required to satisfy one s information need edit in different contexts much library and information science lis research has focused on the information seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work studies have been carried out into the information seeking behaviors of librarians 1 academics 2 medical professionals 3 engineers 4 and lawyers 5 among others much of this research has drawn on the work done by leckie pettigrew now fisher and sylvain who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the lis literature as well as the literature of other academic fields on professionals information seeking the authors proposed an analytic model of professionals information seeking behaviour intended to be generalizable across the professions thus providing a platform for future research in the area the model was intended to prompt new insights and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking 1996 p 160 188 the model has been adapted by wilkinson 2001 who proposes a model of the information seeking of lawyers edit theories of information seeking behavior main article information seeking behavior a variety of theories of information behavior e g zipf s principle

behavior shows that information seeking has generally been accepted as dynamic and non linear foster 2005 kuhlthau 2006 people experience the information search process as an interplay of thoughts feelings and actions kuhlthau 2006 donald o case 2007 also wrote a good book that is a review of the literature information seeking has been found to be linked to a variety of interpersonal communication behaviors beyond question asking to include strategies such as candidate answers robinson s 2010 6 research suggests that when seeking information at work people rely on both other people and information repositories e g documents and databases and spend similar amounts of time consulting each 7 8 and 6 4 of work time respectively 14 2 in total however the distribution of time among the constituent information seeking stages differs depending on the source when consulting other people people spend less time locating the information source and information within that source similar time understanding the information and more time problem solving and decision making than when consulting information repositories furthermore the research found that people spend substantially more time receiving information passively i e information that they have not requested than actively i e information that they have requested and this pattern is also reflected when they provide others with information edit wilson s nested model of conceptual areas wilson s nested model of conceptual areas the concepts of information seeking information retrieval and information behaviour are objects of investigation of information science within this scientific discipline a variety of studies has been undertaken analyzing the interaction of an individual with information sources in case of a specific information need task and context the research models developed in these studies vary in their level of scope wilson 1999 therefore developed a nested model of conceptual areas which visualizes the interrelation of the here mentioned central concepts wilson defines models of information behavior to be statements often in the form of diagrams that attempt to describe an information seeking activity the causes and consequences of that activity or the relationships among stages in information seeking behaviour 1999 250 edit see also browse collaborative information
