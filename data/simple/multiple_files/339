for broken links in wikipedia see wikipedia linkrot wikipedia using the wayback machine and special brokenredirects link rot or linkrot also known as link death or link breaking is an informal term for the process by which increasing numbers of links either on individual websites or the internet in general point to web pages servers or other resources that have become permanently unavailable the phrase also describes the effects of failing to update out of date web pages that clutter search engine results a link that does not work any more is called a broken link dead link or dangling link

literature 6 3 in digital libraries 7 references 8 external links edit causes a link may become broken for several reasons the simplest and most common reason is that the website it links to doesn t exist anymore the most common result of a dead link is a 404 error which indicates that the web server responded but the specific page could not be found some news sites contribute to the problem of link rot by keeping only recent news articles freely accessible then removing them or moving them to a paid subscription area this causes a heavy loss of supporting links in sites discussing newsworthy events and using news sites as references citation needed another type of dead link occurs when the server that hosts the target page stops working or relocates to a new domain name in this case the browser may return a dns error or it may display a site unrelated to the content sought the latter can occur when a domain name is allowed to lapse and is subsequently reregistered by another party domain names acquired in this manner are attractive to those who wish to take advantage of the stream of unsuspecting surfers that will inflate hit counters and pageranking a link might also be broken because of some form of blocking such as content filters or firewalls dead links commonplace on the internet can also occur on the authoring side when website content is assembled copied or deployed without properly verifying the targets or simply not kept up to date edit prevalence the 404 not found response is familiar to even the occasional web user a number of studies have examined the prevalence of link rot on the web in academic literature and in digital libraries in a 2003 experiment fetterly et al discovered that about one link out of every 200 disappeared each week from the internet mccown et al 2005 discovered that half of the urls cited in d lib magazine articles were no longer accessible 10 years after publication and other studies have shown link rot in academic literature to be even worse spinellis 2003 lawrence et al 2001 nelson and allen 2002 examined link rot in digital libraries and found that about 3 of the objects were no longer accessible after one year edit discovering detecting link rot for a given url is difficult using automated methods if a url is accessed and returns an http 200 ok response it may be considered accessible but the contents of the page may have changed and may no longer be relevant some web servers also return a soft 404 a page returned with a 200 ok response instead of a 404 that indicates the url is no longer accessible bar yossef et al 2004 1 developed a heuristic for automatically discovering soft 404s edit combating due to the unprofessional image that dead links bring to both sites linking and linked to there are multiple solutions that are available to tackle them some working to prevent them in the first place and others trying to resolve them when they have occurred there are several tools that have been developed to help combat link rot edit server side avoiding unmanaged hyperlink collections avoiding links to pages deep in a website deep linking using redirection mechanisms e g 301 moved permanently to automatically refer browsers and crawlers to the new location of a url content management systems may offer inbuilt solutions to the management of links e g links are updated when content is changed or moved on the site wordpress guards against link rot by replacing non canonical urls with their canonical versions 2 ibm s peridot attempts to automatically fix broken links permalinking stops broken links by guaranteeing that the content will never move another form of permalinking is linking to a permalink that then redirects to the actual content ensuring that even though the real content may be moved etc links pointing to the resources stay intact edit user side the linkgraph widget gets the url of the correct page based upon the old broken url by using historical location information the google 404 widget employs google technology to guess the correct url and also provides the user a google search box to find the correct page when a user receives a 404 response the google toolbar attempts to assist the user in finding the missing page 3 deadurl com 4 gathers and ranks alternate urls for a broken link using google cache the internet archive and user submissions 5 typing deadurl com left of a broken link in the browser s address bar and pressing enter loads a ranked list of alternate urls or depending on user preference immediately forwards to the best one 6 edit web archiving to combat link rot web archivists are actively engaged in collecting the web or particular portions of the web and ensuring the collection is preserved in an archive such as an archive site for future researchers historians and the public the largest web archiving organization is the internet archive which strives to maintain an archive of the entire web taking periodic snapshots of pages that can then be accessed for free via the wayback machine and without registration many years later simply by typing in the url or automatically by using browser extensions 7 national libraries national archives and various consortia of organizations are also involved in archiving culturally important web content individuals may also use a number of tools that allow them to archive web resources that may go missing in the future webcite a tool specifically for scholarly authors journal editors and publishers to permanently archive on demand and retrieve cited internet references eysenbach and trudel 2005 archive it a subscription service that allows institutions to build manage and search their own web archive some social bookmarking websites such as peeep us 8 bo lt 9 or evernote com 10 allow users to make online clones of any web page on the internet creaing a copy at an independent url which remains online even if the original page goes down google keeps a text based cache temporary copy of the pages it has crawled which can be used to read the information of recently removed pages however unlike in archiving services cached pages are not stored permanently the wayback machine at the internet archive 11 is a free website that archives old web pages it does not archive websites whose owners have stated they do not want their website archived archive is a personal wayback machine which saves text and screenshot of a webpage and keeps it online even if the original page is rot in most aspects it is a webcite analog but also saves images and can save pages from web 2 0 sites like twitter edit authors citing urls a number of studies have shown how widespread link rot is in academic literature see below authors of scholarly publications have also developed best practices for combating link rot in their work avoiding url citations that point to resources on a researcher s personal home page mccown et al 2005 using
