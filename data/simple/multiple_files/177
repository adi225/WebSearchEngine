it has been suggested that this article or section be merged with dimension data warehouse discuss proposed since december 2012 in data warehousing a dimension table is one of the set of companion tables to a fact table the fact table contains business facts or measures and foreign keys which refer to candidate keys normally primary keys in the dimension tables contrary to fact tables dimension tables contain descriptive attributes or fields that are typically textual fields or discrete numbers that behave like text these attributes are designed to serve two critical purposes query constraining and or filtering and query result set labeling dimension attributes should be verbose labels consisting of full words descriptive complete having no missing values discretely valued having only one value per dimension table row quality assured having no misspellings or impossible values dimension table rows are uniquely identified by a single key field it is recommended that the key field be a simple integer because a key value is meaningless used only for joining fields between the fact and dimension tables the use of surrogate dimension keys brings several advantages including performance join processing is made much more efficient by using a single field the surrogate key buffering from operational key management practices this prevents situations where removed data rows might reappear when their natural keys get reused or reassigned after a long period of dormancy mapping to integrate disparate sources handling unknown or not applicable connections tracking changes in dimension attribute values although surrogate key use places a burden put on the etl system pipeline processing can be improved and etl tools have built in improved surrogate key processing the goal of a dimension table is to create standardized conformed dimensions that can be shared across the enterprise s data warehouse environment and enable joining to multiple fact tables representing various business processes conformed dimensions are important to the enterprise nature of dw bi systems because they promote consistency every fact table is filtered consistently so that query answers are labeled consistently integration queries can drill into different process fact tables separately for each individual fact table then join the results on common dimension attributes reduced development time to market the common dimensions are available without recreating them over time the attributes of a given row in a dimension table may change for example the shipping address for a company may change kimball refers to this phenomenon as slowly changing dimensions strategies for dealing with this kind of change are divided into three categories type one simply overwrite the old value s type two add a new row containing the new value s and distinguish between the rows using tuple versioning techniques type three add a new attribute to the existing row edit see also data warehouse dimension fact table edit references kimball ralph the data warehouse lifecycle toolkit second edition winely publishing inc 2008 p 241 246 kimball ralph et al 1998 the data warehouse lifecycle toolkit p17 pub wiley isbn 0 471 25547 5 kimball ralph 1996 the data warehouse toolkit p100 pub wiley isbn 0 471 15337 0 v t e data warehouse 160 creating the data warehouse concepts database dimension dimensional modeling fact olap star schema aggregate variants anchor modeling column oriented dbms data vault modeling holap molap rolap operational data store elements data dictionary metadata data mart sixth normal form surrogate key fact fact table early arriving fact measure dimension dimension table degenerate slowly changing filling extract transform load etl extract transform load 160 using the data warehouse concepts business intelligence dashboard data mining decision support system dss olap cube languages data mining extensions dmx multidimensional expressions mdx xml for analysis xmla tools business intelligence tools reporting software spreadsheet 160 related people bill inmon ralph kimball products comparison of olap servers data warehousing products and their producers
