game of dots and boxes on the 2 2 board dots and boxes also known as boxes squares paddocks pigs in a pen square it dots and dashes dots smart dots dot boxing or simply the dot game is a pencil and paper game for two players or sometimes more than two first published in 1889 by douard lucas starting with an empty grid of dots players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots a player who completes the fourth side of a 1 1 box earns one point and takes another turn the points are typically recorded by placing in the box an identifying mark of the player such as an initial the game ends when no more lines can be placed the winner of the game is the player with the most points the board may be of any size when short on time 2 2 boxes created by a square of 9 dots is good for beginners and 5 5 is good for experts the diagram on the right shows a game being played on the 2 2 board the second player b plays the mirror image of the first player s move hoping to divide the board into two pieces and tie the game the first player a makes a sacrifice at move 7 b accepts the sacrifice getting one box however b must now add another line and connects the center dot to the center right dot causing the remaining boxes to be joined together in a chain as shown at the end of move 8 with a s next move a gets them all winning 3 1 contents 1

novice player would create position 2 and lose an experienced player would create position 3 and win for most novice players the game begins with a phase of more or less random connecting of dots where the only strategy is to avoid adding the third side to any box this continues until all the remaining potential boxes are joined together into chains groups of one or more adjacent boxes in which any move gives all the boxes in the chain to the opponent at this point players typically take all available boxes then open the smallest available chain to their opponent for example a novice player faced with a situation like position 1 in the diagram on the left in which some boxes can be captured may take all the boxes in the chain resulting in position 2 but with their last move they have to open the next and larger chain and the novice loses the game 1 a more experienced player faced with position 1 instead plays the double cross strategy taking all but 2 of the boxes in the chain leaving position 3 this leaves the last two boxes in the chain for their opponent but then the opponent has to open the next chain by moving to position 3 player a wins the double cross strategy applies however many long chains there are take all but two of the boxes in each chain but take all the boxes in the last chain if the chains are long enough then the player will certainly win therefore when played by experts dots and boxes becomes a battle for control an expert player tries to force their opponent to start the first long chain as the player to start the first long chain usually loses 1 against a player who doesn t understand the concept of a sacrifice the expert simply has to make the correct number of sacrifices to encourage the opponent to hand him the first chain long enough to ensure a win if the other player also knows to offer sacrifices the expert also has to manipulate the number of available sacrifices through earlier play there is never any reason not to accept a sacrifice as if it is refused the player who offered it can always take it without penalty thus the impact of refusing a sacrifice need not be considered in your strategy citation needed in combinatorial game theory dots and boxes is an impartial game and many positions can be analyzed using sprague grundy theory however dots and boxes lacks the normal play convention of most impartial games where the last player to move wins which complicates the analysis considerably 1 edit unusual grids dots and boxes need not be played on a rectangular grid it can be played on a triangular grid or a hexagonal grid there is also a variant in bolivia when it is played in a chakana or inca cross grid which adds more complications to the game dots and boxes has a dual form called strings and coins this game is played on a network of coins vertices joined by strings edges players take turns to cut a string when a cut leaves a coin with no strings the player pockets the coin and takes another turn the winner is the player who pockets the most coins strings and coins can be played on an arbitrary graph a variant played in poland allows a player to claim a region of several squares as soon as its boundary is completed in the netherlands it is called kamertje verhuren translated to rent a room where the outerlimit already haslines edit video game ksquares 160 one of the
