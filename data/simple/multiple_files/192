blood of the vampire that flows through her veins switching back and forth from a state of consciousness to a state of semi trance during which she is telepathically connected with dracula this telepathic connection is established to be two way in that the count can influence mina but in doing so betrays to her awareness of his surroundings after the group sterilizes all of his lairs in

income by writing a large number of sensational novels his most famous being the vampire tale dracula published on 26 may 1897 3 269 parts of it are set around the town of whitby where he spent summer holidays throughout the 1880s and 1890s authors such as h rider haggard rudyard kipling robert louis stevenson arthur conan doyle and h g wells wrote many tales in which fantastic creatures threatened the british empire invasion literature was at a peak and stoker s formula of an invasion of england by continental european influences was by 1897 very familiar to readers of fantastic adventure stories victorian readers enjoyed it as a good adventure story like many others but it would not reach its iconic legendary status until later in the 20th century when film versions began to appear 4 shakespearean actor and friend of stoker s sir henry irving was a possible real life inspiration for the character of dracula the role was tailor made to his dramatic presence gentlemanly mannerisms and affinity for playing villain roles irving however never agreed to play the part on stage before writing dracula stoker spent seven years researching european folklore and stories of vampires being most influenced by emily gerard s 1885 essay transylvania superstitions despite being the most widely known vampire novel dracula was not the first it was preceded and partly inspired by sheridan le fanu s 1871 carmilla about a lesbian vampire who preys on a lonely young woman and by varney the vampire a lengthy penny dreadful serial from the mid victorian period by james malcolm rymer the image of a vampire portrayed as an aristocratic man like the character of dracula was created by john polidori in the vampyre 1819 during the summer spent with frankenstein creator mary shelley her husband the poet percy bysshe shelley and lord byron in 1816 the lyceum theatre where stoker worked between 1878 and 1898 was headed by the actor manager henry irving who was stoker s real life inspiration for dracula s mannerisms and who stoker hoped would play dracula in a stage version 5 although irving never did agree to do a stage version dracula s dramatic sweeping gestures and gentlemanly mannerisms drew their living embodiment from irving 5 the dead un dead was one of stoker s original titles for dracula and up until a few weeks before publication the manuscript was titled simply the un dead stoker s notes for dracula show that the name of the count was originally count wampyr but while doing research stoker became intrigued by the name dracula after reading william wilkinson s book account of the principalities of wallachia and moldavia with political observations relative to them london 1820 6 which he found in the whitby library and consulted a number of times during visits to whitby in the 1890s 7 the name dracula was the patronym dr culea of the descendants of vlad ii of wallachia who took the name dracul after being invested in the order of the dragon in 1431 in the romanian language the word dracul romanian drac dragon ul the can mean either the dragon or especially in the present day the devil 8 the novel has been in the public domain in the united states since its original publication because stoker failed to follow proper copyright procedure in the united kingdom and other countries following the berne convention on copyrights however the novel was under copyright until april 1962 fifty years after stoker s death 9 when f w murnau s unauthorized film adaptation nosferatu was released in 1922 the popularity of the novel increased considerably owing to the controversy caused when stoker s widow tried to have the film removed from public circulation 10 edit reaction 1899 first american edition doubleday amp mcclure new york when it was first published in 1897 dracula was not an immediate bestseller although reviewers were unstinting in their praise the contemporary daily mail ranked stoker s powers above those of mary shelley and edgar allan poe as well as emily bront s wuthering heights 11 according to literary historians nina auerbach and david skal in the norton critical edition the novel has become more significant for modern readers than it was for contemporary victorian readers most of whom enjoyed it just as a good adventure story it only reached its broad iconic legendary classic status later in the 20th century when the movie versions appeared 12 it didn t make much money for stoker the last year of his life he was so poor that he had to petition for a compassionate grant from the royal literary fund 13 and in 1913 his widow was forced to sell his notes and outlines of the novel at a sotheby s auction where they were purchased for a little over 2 pounds 14 but when w murnau s unauthorized adaptation of the story in the form of nosferatu was released on the theatres in 1922 stoker s widow took affaire and during the legal battle that followed the novel s popularity started to grow nosferatu was followed by a highly successful stage adaptation touring the uk for three years before arriving in us where stoker s creation caught hollywood s attention and after the american 1931 movie version was released the book has never been out of print 15 however some victorian fans were ahead of the time describing it as the sensation of the season and the most blood curdling novel of the paralysed century 16 sherlock holmes author sir arthur conan doyle wrote to stoker in a letter i write to tell you how very much i have enjoyed reading dracula i think it is the very best story of diablerie which i have read for many years 17 the daily mail review of 1 june 1897 proclaimed it a classic of gothic horror in seeking a parallel to this weird powerful and horrorful story our mind reverts to such tales as the mysteries of udolpho frankenstein the fall of the house of usher but dracula is even more appalling in its gloomy fascination than any one of these 18 similarly good reviews appeared when the book was published in the u s in 1899 the first american edition was published by doubleday and mcclure in new york edit historical and geographical references although dracula is a work of fiction it does contain some historical references the historical connections with the novel and how much stoker knew about the history are a matter of conjecture and debate following the publication of in search of dracula by radu florescu and raymond mcnally in 1972 the supposed connections between the historical transylvanian born vlad iii dracula of wallachia and bram stoker s fictional dracula attracted popular attention during his main reign 1456 1462 vlad the impaler is said to have killed from 40 000 to 100 000 european civilians political rivals criminals and anyone else he considered useless to humanity mainly by using his favourite method of impaling them on a sharp pole the main sources dealing with these events are records by saxon settlers in neighbouring transylvania who had frequent clashes with vlad iii vlad iii is revered as a folk hero by romanians for driving off the invading turks his impaled victims are said to have included as many as 100 000 ottoman turks 19 vlad the impaler also known as vlad dracula historically the name dracula is derived from a chivalric order called the order of the dragon founded by sigismund of luxembourg then king of hungary later also holy roman emperor to uphold christianity and defend the empire against the ottoman turks vlad ii dracul father of vlad iii was admitted to the order around 1431 because of his bravery in fighting the turks from 1431 onward vlad ii wore the emblem of the order and later as ruler of wallachia his coinage bore the dragon symbol the name dracula means son of dracul stoker came across the name dracula in his reading on romanian history and chose this to replace the name count wampyr that he had originally intended to use for his villain however some dracula scholars led by elizabeth miller have questioned the depth of this connection they argue that stoker in fact knew little of the historic vlad iii except for the name dracula there are sections in the novel where dracula refers to his own background and these speeches show that stoker had some knowledge of romanian history stoker mentions the dracula who fought against the turks and was later betrayed by his brother historical facts which unequivocally point to vlad iii who was it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beat the turk on his own ground this was a dracula indeed woe was it that his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the turk and brought the shame of slavery on them was it not this dracula indeed who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkey land who when he was beaten back came again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph chapter 3 pp 19 the count s intended identity is later explicitly confirmed by professor van helsing he must indeed have been that voivode dracula who won his name against the turk over the great river on the very frontier of turkey land chapter 18 pp 145 the dracula legend as he created it and as it has been portrayed in films and television shows may be a compound of various influences many of stoker s biographers and literary critics have found strong similarities to the earlier irish writer sheridan le fanu s classic of the vampire genre carmilla in writing dracula stoker may also have drawn on stories about the s dhe citation needed some of which feature blood drinking women the folkloric figure of abhartach has also been suggested as a source citation needed in 1983 mcnally additionally suggested that stoker was influenced by the history of hungarian countess elizabeth bathory who tortured and killed between 36 and 700 young women over a period of many years 20 it was later commonly believed that she committed these crimes in order to bathe in their blood believing that this preserved her youth 21 in her book the essential dracula clare haword maden opined the castle of count dracula was inspired by slains castle at which bram stoker was a guest of the 19th earl of erroll 22 according to miller he first visited cruden bay in 1893 three years after work on dracula had begun haining and tremaine maintain that during this visit stoker was especially impressed by slains castle s interior and the surrounding landscape miller and leatherdale question the stringency of this connection 23 possibly stoker was not inspired by a real edifice at all but by jules vernes s novel the castle of the carpathians or anne radcliffe s the mysteries of udolpho 1794 24 a third possibility is that he copied information about a castle at v cs from one of his sources on transylvania the book by major e c johnson 25 a further option is that stoker saw an illustration of castle bran t rzburg in the book on transylvania by charles boner or read about it in the books by mazuchelli or crosse 26 many of the scenes in whitby and london are based on real places that stoker frequently visited although in some cases he distorts the geography for the sake of the story daniel farson leonard wolf and peter haining have suggested that stoker received much historical information from rmin v mb ry a hungarian professor he met at least twice miller argues there is nothing to indicate that the conversation included vlad vampires or even transylvania and that furthermore there is no record of any other correspondence between stoker and v mb ry nor is v mb ry mentioned in stoker s notes for dracula 27 edit adaptations for more details on this topic see dracula in popular culture bela lugosi as dracula 1931 the story of dracula has been the basis for numerous films and plays stoker himself wrote the first theatrical adaptation which was presented at the lyceum theatre under the title dracula or the undead shortly before the novel s publication and performed only once popular films include dracula 1931 dracula alternative title the horror of dracula 1958 and dracula also known as bram stoker s dracula 1992 dracula was also adapted as nosferatu 1922 a film directed by the german director f w murnau without permission from stoker s widow the filmmakers attempted to avoid copyright problems by altering many of the details including changing the name of the villain to count orlok the character of count dracula has remained popular over the years and many films have used the character as a villain while others have named him in their titles including dracula s daughter the brides of dracula and zoltan hound of dracula as of 2009 an estimated 217 films feature dracula in a major role 28 a number second only to sherlock holmes 223 films 29 most adaptations do not include all the major characters from the novel the count is always present and jonathan and mina harker dr seward dr van helsing and renfield usually appear as well the characters of mina and lucy are often combined into a single female role jonathan harker and renfield are also sometimes reversed or combined quincey morris and arthur holmwood are usually omitted entirely bram stoker s dracula being a notable exception edit dracula s guest in 1914 two years after stoker s death the short story dracula s guest was posthumously published it was according to most contemporary critics the deleted first or second chapter from the original manuscript 30 and the one which gave the volume its name 3 325 but which the original publishers deemed unnecessary to the overall story dracula s guest follows an unnamed englishman traveller whom most readers identify as renfield from seward s asylum the first lawyer sent by mr hawkins as he wanders around munich before leaving for transylvania it is walpurgis night and in spite of the coachman s warnings the young englishman foolishly leaves his hotel and wanders through a dense forest alone along the way he feels he is being watched by a tall and thin stranger possibly count dracula the short story climaxes in an old graveyard where in a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven into it the englishman encounters a sleeping female vampire called countess dolingen this malevolent and beautiful vampire awakens from her marble bier to conjure a snowstorm before being struck by lightning and returning to her eternal prison however the englishman s troubles are not quite over as he is dragged away by an unseen force and rendered unconscious he awakes to find a gigantic wolf lying on his chest and licking at his throat however the wolf merely keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives when the englishman is finally taken back to his hotel a telegram awaits him from his expectant host dracula with a
