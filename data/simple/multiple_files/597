ubiquitous computing ubicomp is a post desktop model of human computer interaction in which information processing has been thoroughly integrated into everyday objects and activities in the course of ordinary activities someone using ubiquitous computing engages many computational devices and systems simultaneously and may not necessarily even be aware that they are doing so this model is considered an advancement from the older desktop paradigm more formally ubiquitous computing is defined as machines that fit the human environment instead of forcing humans to enter theirs 1 this paradigm is also described as pervasive computing ambient intelligence 2 or more recently everyware 3 where each term emphasizes slightly different aspects when primarily concerning the objects involved it is also physical computing the internet of things haptic computing 4 and things that think rather than propose a single definition for ubiquitous computing and for these related terms a taxonomy of properties for ubiquitous computing has been proposed from which different kinds or flavors of ubiquitous systems and applications can be described 5 contents 1 core concepts 2 history 3 examples 4 current research 5 see also 6 references 7 resources and other external links edit core concepts at their core all models of ubiquitous computing share a vision of small inexpensive robust networked processing devices distributed at all scales throughout everyday life and generally turned to distinctly common place ends for example a domestic ubiquitous computing environment might interconnect lighting and environmental controls with personal biometric monitors woven into clothing so that illumination and heating conditions in a room might be modulated continuously and imperceptibly another common scenario posits refrigerators aware of their suitably tagged contents able to both plan a variety of menus from the food actually on hand and warn users of stale or spoiled food ubiquitous computing presents challenges across computer science in systems design and engineering in systems modelling and in user interface design contemporary human computer interaction models whether command line menu driven or gui based are inappropriate and inadequate to the ubiquitous case this suggests that the natural interaction paradigm appropriate to a fully robust ubiquitous computing has yet to emerge although there is also recognition in the field that in many ways we are already living in an ubicomp world contemporary devices that lend some support to this latter idea include mobile phones digital audio players radio frequency identification tags gps and interactive whiteboards mark weiser proposed three basic forms for ubiquitous system devices see also smart device tabs pads and boards tabs wearable centimetre sized devices pads hand held decimetre sized devices boards metre sized interactive display devices these three forms proposed by weiser are characterized by being macro sized having a planar form and on incorporating visual output displays if we relax each of these three characteristics we can expand this range into a much more diverse and potentially more useful range of ubiquitous computing devices hence three additional forms for ubiquitous systems have been proposed 5 dust miniaturized devices can be without visual output displays e g micro electro mechanical systems mems ranging from nanometres through micrometers to millimetres see also smart dust skin fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers organic computer devices can be formed into more flexible non planar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains see oled display mems device can also be painted onto various surfaces so that a variety of physical world structures can act as networked surfaces of mems clay ensembles of mems can be formed into arbitrary three dimensional shapes as artefacts resembling many different kinds of physical object see also tangible interface in his book the rise of the network society manuel castells suggests that there is an ongoing shift from already decentralised stand alone microcomputers and mainframes towards entirely pervasive computing in his model of a pervasive computing system castells uses the example of the internet as the start of a pervasive computing system the logical progression from that paradigm is a system where that networking logic becomes applicable in every realm of daily activity in every location and every context castells envisages a system where billions of miniature ubiquitous inter communication devices will be spread worldwide like pigment in the wall paint edit history mark weiser coined the phrase ubiquitous computing around 1988 during his tenure as chief technologist of the xerox palo alto research center parc both alone and with parc director and chief scientist john seely brown weiser wrote some of the earliest papers on the subject largely defining it and sketching out its major concerns 6 7 8 recognizing that the extension of processing power into everyday scenarios would necessitate understandings of social cultural and psychological phenomena beyond its proper ambit weiser was influenced by many fields outside computer science including philosophy phenomenology anthropology psychology post modernism sociology of science and feminist criticism he was explicit about the humanistic origins of the invisible ideal in post modernist thought 8 referencing as well the ironically dystopian philip k dick novel ubik dr ken sakamura of university of tokyo japan leads the ubiquitous networking laboratory unl tokyo as well as the t engine forum the joint goal of sakamura s ubiquitous networking specification and the t engine forum is to enable any everyday device to broadcast and receive information 9 10 mit has also contributed significant research in this field notably things that think consortium directed by hiroshi ishii joseph a paradiso and rosalind picard at the media lab 11 and the csail effort known as project oxygen 12 other major contributors include university of washington

equator 13 ajou university ucri amp cus 14 edit examples one of the earliest ubiquitous systems was artist natalie jeremijenko s live wire also known as dangling string installed at xerox parc during mark weiser s time there this was a piece of string attached to a stepper motor and controlled by a lan connection network activity caused the string to twitch yielding a peripherally noticeable indication of traffic weiser called this an example of calm technology 15 ambient devices has produced an orb a dashboard and a weather beacon these decorative devices receive data from a wireless network and report current events such as stock prices and the weather like the nabaztag produced by violet snowden the australian futurist mark pesce has produced a highly configurable 52 led lamp enabled lamp which uses wi fi named moorescloud after moore s law 16 the unified computer intelligence corporation has launched a device called ubi the ubiquitous computer that is designed to allow
