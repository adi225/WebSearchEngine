in computing online analytical processing or olap pron o l p is an approach to answering multi dimensional analytical mda queries swiftly 1 olap is part of the broader category of business intelligence which also encompasses relational database report writing and data mining 2 typical applications of olap include business reporting for sales marketing management reporting business process management bpm 3 budgeting and forecasting financial reporting and similar areas with new applications coming up such as agriculture 4 the term olap was created as a slight modification of the traditional database term oltp online transaction processing 5 olap tools enable users to analyze multidimensional data interactively from multiple perspectives olap consists of three basic analytical operations consolidation roll up drill down and slicing and dicing 6 consolidation involves the aggregation of data that can be accumulated and computed in one or more dimensions for example all sales offices are rolled up to the sales department or sales division to anticipate sales trends by contrast the drill down is a technique that allows users to navigate through the details for instance users can view the sales by individual products that make up a region s sales slicing and dicing is a feature whereby users can take out slicing a specific set of data of the olap cube and view dicing the slices from different viewpoints databases configured for olap use a multidimensional data model allowing for complex analytical and ad hoc queries with a rapid execution time 7 they borrow

of olap systems the core of any olap system is an olap cube also called a multidimensional cube or a hypercube it consists of numeric facts called measures which are categorized by dimensions the measures are placed at the intersections of the hypercube which is spanned by the dimensions as a vector space the usual interface to manipulate an olap cube is a matrix interface like pivot tables in a spreadsheet program which performs projection operations along the dimensions such as aggregation or averaging the cube metadata is typically created from a star schema or snowflake schema of tables in a relational database measures are derived from the records in the fact table and dimensions are derived from the dimension tables each measure can be thought of as having a set of labels or meta data associated with it a dimension is what describes these labels it provides information about the measure a simple example would be a cube that contains a store s sales as a measure and date time as a dimension each sale has a date time label that describes more about that sale any number of dimensions can be added to the structure such as store cashier or customer by adding a foreign key column to the fact table this allows an analyst to view the measures along any combination of the dimensions for example sales fact table sale amount time id time dimension 2008 10 1234 time id timestamp gt 1234 20080902 12 35 43 edit multidimensional databases multidimensional structure is defined as a variation of the relational model that uses multidimensional structures to organize data and express the relationships between data 8 the structure is broken into cubes and the cubes are able to store and access data within the confines of each cube each cell within a multidimensional structure contains aggregated data related to elements along each of its dimensions 9 even when data is manipulated it remains easy to access and continues to constitute a compact database format the data still remains interrelated multidimensional structure is quite popular for analytical databases that use online analytical processing olap applications o brien amp marakas 2009 analytical databases use these databases because of their ability to deliver answers to complex business queries swiftly data can be viewed from different angles which gives a broader perspective of a problem unlike other models 10 edit aggregations it has been claimed that for complex queries olap cubes can produce an answer in around 0 1 of the time required for the same query on oltp relational data 11 12 the most important mechanism in olap which allows it to achieve such performance is the use of aggregations aggregations are built from the fact table by changing the granularity on specific dimensions and aggregating up data along these dimensions the number of possible aggregations is determined by every possible combination of dimension granularities the combination of all possible aggregations and the base data contains the answers to every query which can be answered from the data 13 because usually there are many aggregations that can be calculated often only a predetermined number are fully calculated the remainder are solved on demand the problem of deciding which aggregations views to calculate is known as the view selection problem view selection can be constrained by the total size of the selected set of aggregations the time to update them from changes in the base data or both the objective of view selection is typically to minimize the average time to answer olap queries although some studies also minimize the update time view selection is np complete many approaches to the problem have been explored including greedy algorithms randomized search genetic algorithms and a search algorithm edit types olap systems have been traditionally categorized using the following taxonomy 14 edit multidimensional main article molap molap is the classic form of olap and is sometimes referred to as just olap molap stores this data in an optimized multi dimensional array storage rather than in a relational database therefore it requires the pre computation and storage of information in the cube the operation known as processing molap tools generally utilize a pre calculated data set referred to as a data cube the data cube contains all the possible answers to a given range of questions molap tools have a very fast response time and the ability to quickly write back data into the data set edit relational main article rolap rolap works directly with relational databases the base data and the dimension tables are stored as relational tables and new tables are created to hold the aggregated information depends on a specialized schema design this methodology relies on manipulating the data stored in the relational database to give the appearance of traditional olap s slicing and dicing functionality in essence each action of slicing and dicing is equivalent to adding a where clause in the sql statement rolap tools do not use pre calculated data cubes but instead pose the query to the standard relational database and its tables in order to bring back the data required to answer the question rolap tools feature the ability to ask any question because the methodology does not limit to the contents of a cube rolap also has the ability to drill down to the lowest level of detail in the database edit hybrid main article holap there is no clear agreement across the industry as to what constitutes hybrid olap except that a database will divide data between relational and specialized storage for example for some vendors a holap database will use relational tables to hold the larger quantities of detailed data and use specialized storage for at least some aspects of the smaller quantities of more aggregate or less detailed data holap addresses the shortcomings of molap and rolap by combining the capabilities of both approaches holap tools can utilize both pre calculated cubes and relational data sources edit comparison each type has certain benefits although there is disagreement about the specifics of the benefits between providers some molap implementations are prone to database explosion a phenomenon causing vast amounts of storage space to be used by molap databases when certain common conditions are met high number of dimensions pre calculated results and sparse multidimensional data molap generally delivers better performance due to specialized indexing and storage optimizations molap also needs less storage space compared to rolap because the specialized storage typically includes compression techniques 15 rolap is generally more scalable 15 however large volume pre processing is difficult to implement efficiently so it is frequently skipped rolap query performance can therefore suffer tremendously since rolap relies more on the database to perform calculations it has more limitations in the specialized functions it can use holap encompasses a range of solutions that attempt to mix the best of rolap and molap it can generally pre process swiftly scale well and offer good function support edit other types the following acronyms are also sometimes used although they are not as widespread as the ones above wolap web based olap dolap desktop olap rtolap real time olap edit apis and query languages unlike relational databases which had sql as the standard query language and widespread apis such as odbc jdbc and oledb there was no such unification in the olap world for a long time the first real standard api was ole db for olap specification from microsoft which appeared in 1997 and introduced the mdx query language several olap vendors both server and client adopted it in 2001 microsoft and hyperion announced the xml for analysis specification which was endorsed by most of the olap vendors since this also used mdx as a query language mdx became the de facto standard 16 since september 2011 linq can be used to query ssas olap cubes from microsoft net 17 edit products edit history the first product that performed olap queries was express which was released in 1970 and acquired by oracle in 1995 from information resources 18 however the term did not appear until 1993 when it was coined by edgar f codd who has been described as the father of the relational database codd s paper 1 resulted from a short consulting assignment which codd undertook for former arbor software later hyperion solutions and in 2007 acquired by oracle as a sort of marketing coup the company had released its own olap product essbase a year earlier as a result codd s twelve laws of online analytical processing were explicit in their reference to essbase there was some ensuing controversy and when computerworld learned that codd was paid by arbor it retracted the article olap market experienced strong growth in late 90s with dozens of commercial products going into market in 1998 microsoft released its first olap server microsoft analysis services which drove wide adoption of olap technology and moved it into mainstream edit product comparison see comparison of olap
