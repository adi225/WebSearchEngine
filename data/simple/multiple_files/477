reactive business intelligence rbi advocates an holistic approach that integrates data mining modeling and interactive visualization into an end to end discovery and continuous innovation process powered by human and automated learning 1 in the area of decision making this approach has been used to adapt the decision method to the knowledge which is progressively acquired from the decision maker 2 edit relationships with reactive search optimization rso rso is multi disciplinary rso is a multi disciplinary research area between operations research optimization computer science machine learning and neural networks that studies online learning schemes applied to problem solving and optimization according to a learning while optimizing principle 3 the word reactive hints at a ready response to events during the search through an internal feedback loop for online self tuning and dynamic adaptation online adaptation and model revision is used in reactive business intelligence to adapt the data mining and interactive visualization techniques to the knowledge derived from a user in real time edit references roberto battiti and mauro brunato reactive business intelligence from data to models to insight reactive search srl italy february 2011 isbn 978 88 905795 0 9 battiti roberto andrea passerini 2010 brain computer evolutionary multi objective optimization bc emo a genetic algorithm adapting to the decision maker pdf ieee transactions on evolutionary computation 14 15 671 687 doi 10 1109 tevc 2010 2058118 http rtm science unitn it battiti archive bcemo pdf battiti roberto mauro brunato franco mascia 2008 reactive search and intelligent optimization springer verlag isbn 160 978 0 387 09623 0 http reactive search org thebook edit see also business intelligence data mining interactive visualization lionsolver implementing the reactive business intelligence principles
