of the forms and functions of memory in the sciences in psychology memory is the process by which information is encoded stored and retrieved encoding allows information that is from the outside world to reach our senses in the forms of chemical and physical stimuli in this first stage we must change the information so that we may put the memory into the encoding process storage is the second memory stage or process this entails that we maintain information over periods of time finally the third process is the retrieval of information that we have stored we must locate it and return it to our consciousness some retrieval attempts may be effortless due to the type of information from an information processing perspective there are three main stages in the formation and retrieval of memory encoding or registration receiving processing and combining of received information storage creation of a permanent record of the encoded information retrieval recall or recollection calling back the stored information in response to some cue for use in a process or activity the loss of memory is described as forgetfulness or as a medical disorder amnesia contents 1 sensory memory 2 short

sensory memory main article sensory memory sensory memory holds sensory information for a few seconds or less after an item is perceived the ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a second of observation or memorisation is an example of sensory memory with very short presentations participants often report that they seem to see more than they can actually report the first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by george sperling 1963 1 using the partial report paradigm subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters arranged into three rows of four after a brief presentation subjects were then played either a high medium or low tone cuing them which of the rows to report based on these partial report experiments sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items but that it degraded very quickly within a few hundred milliseconds because this form of memory degrades so quickly participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items 12 in the whole report procedure before they decayed this type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal there are many types of sensory memories iconic memory is a fast decaying store of visual information a type of sensory memory that briefly stores an image which has been perceived for a small duration echoic memory is a fast decaying store of auditory information another type of sensory memory that briefly stores sounds which has been perceived for a small duration 2 edit short term memory main article short term memory short term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal its capacity is also very limited george a miller 1956 when working at bell laboratories conducted experiments showing that the store of short term memory was 7 2 items the title of his famous paper the magical number 7 2 modern estimates of the capacity of short term memory are lower typically of the order of 4 5 items 3 however memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking 4 for example in recalling a ten digit telephone number a person could chunk the digits into three groups first the area code such as 123 then a three digit chunk 456 and lastly a four digit chunk 7890 this method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers this may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of three numbers with the final four number group generally broken down into two groups of two short term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information and to a lesser extent a visual code conrad 1964 5 found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar e g e p d confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically conrad s 1964 study however deals with the encoding of written text thus while memory of written language may rely on acoustic components generalisations to all forms of memory cannot be made edit long term memory olin levi warner memory 1896 library of congress thomas jefferson building washington d c main article long term memory the storage in sensory memory and short term memory generally have a strictly limited capacity and duration which means that information is not retained indefinitely by contrast long term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration sometimes a whole life span its capacity is immeasurably large for example given a random seven digit number we may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting suggesting it was stored in our short term memory on the other hand we can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition this information is said to be stored in long term memory while short term memory encodes information acoustically long term memory encodes it semantically baddeley 1966 6 discovered that after 20 minutes test subjects had the most difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings e g big large great huge long term another part of long term memory is episodic memory which attempts to capture information such as what when and where 7 full citation needed with episodic memory individuals are able to recall specific events such as birthday parties and weddings short term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication dependent on regions of the frontal lobe especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe long term memories on the other hand are maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain the hippocampus is essential for learning new information to the consolidation of information from short term to long term memory although it does not seem to store information itself without the hippocampus new memories are unable to be stored into long term memory as learned from hm after removal of his hippocampus citation needed and there will be a very short attention span furthermore it may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning one of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be improving consolidation of information as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test 8 additionally data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain which mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day citation needed suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal research has suggested that long term memory storage in humans may be maintained by dna methylation 9 or prions 10 edit models models of memory provide abstract representations of how memory is believed to work below are several models proposed over the years by various psychologists note that there is some controversy as to whether there are several memory structures for example tarnow 2005 finds that it is likely that there is only one memory structure between 6 and 600 seconds edit atkinson shiffrin model see also memory consolidation the multi store model also known as atkinson shiffrin memory model was first recognized in 1968 by atkinson and shiffrin the multi store model has been criticised for being too simplistic for instance long term memory is believed to be actually made up of multiple subcomponents such as episodic and procedural memory it also proposes that rehearsal is the only mechanism by which information eventually reaches long term storage but evidence shows us capable of remembering things without rehearsal the model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently for example short term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information patient kf proves this patient kf was brain damaged and had problems with his short term memory he had problems with things such as spoken numbers letters and words and with significant sounds such as doorbells and cats meowing other parts of short term memory were unaffected such as visual pictures 11 it also shows the sensory store as a single unit whilst we know that the sensory store is split up into several different parts such as taste vision and hearing edit working memory the working memory model main article working memory in 1974 baddeley and hitch proposed a working memory model which replaced the general concept of short term memory with an active maintenance of information in the short term storage in this model working memory consists of three basic stores the central executive the phonological loop and the visuo spatial sketchpad in 2000 this model was expanded with the multimodal episodic buffer 12 the central executive essentially acts as attention it channels information to the three component processes the phonological loop the visuo spatial sketchpad and the episodic buffer the phonological loop stores auditory information by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a continuous loop the articulatory process for example the repetition of a telephone number over and over again a short list of data is easier to remember the visuospatial sketchpad stores visual and spatial information it is engaged when performing spatial tasks such as judging distances or visual ones such as counting the windows on a house or imagining images the episodic buffer is dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual spatial and verbal information and chronological ordering e g the memory of a story or a movie scene the episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long term memory and semantical meaning the working memory model explains many practical observations such as why it is easier to do two different tasks one verbal and one visual than two similar tasks e g two visual and the aforementioned word length effect however the concept of a central executive as noted here has been criticised as inadequate and vague citation needed working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought it is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics 12 edit types of memory researchers distinguish between recognition and recall memory recognition memory tasks require individuals to indicate whether they have encountered a stimulus such as a picture or a word before recall memory tasks require participants to retrieve previously learned information for example individuals might be asked to produce a series of actions they have seen before or to say a list of words they have heard before edit classification by information type topographic memory involves the ability to orient oneself in space to recognize and follow an itinerary or to recognize familiar places 13 getting lost when traveling alone is an example of the failure of topographic memory this is often reported among elderly patients who are evaluated for dementia the disorder could be caused by multiple impairments including difficulties with perception orientation and memory 14 flashbulb memories are clear episodic memories of unique and highly emotional events 15 remembering where you were or what you were doing when you first heard the news of president kennedy s assassination 16 or about 9 11 are examples of flashbulb memories anderson 1976 17 divides long term memory into declarative explicit and procedural implicit memories edit declarative memory declarative memory requires conscious recall in that some conscious process must call back the information it is sometimes called explicit memory since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved declarative memory can be further sub divided into semantic memory which concerns facts taken independent of context and episodic memory which concerns information specific to a particular context such as a time and place semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world such as paris is the capital of france episodic memory on the other hand is used for more personal memories such as the sensations emotions and personal associations of a particular place or time autobiographical memory memory for particular events within one s own life is generally viewed as either equivalent to or a subset of episodic memory visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience one is able to place in memory information that resembles objects places animals or people in sort of a mental image visual memory can result in priming and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon 18 edit procedural memory in contrast procedural memory or implicit memory is not based on the conscious recall of information but on implicit learning procedural memory is primarily employed in learning motor skills and should be considered a subset of implicit memory it is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition no new explicit memories have been formed but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences procedural memory involved in motor learning depends on the cerebellum and basal ganglia a characteristic of procedural memory is that the things that are remembered are automatically translated into actions and thus sometimes difficult to describe some examples of procedural memory include the ability to ride a bike or tie shoelaces 19 edit classification by temporal direction a further major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past retrospective memory or whether the content is to be remembered in the future prospective memory thus retrospective memory as a category includes semantic episodic and autobiographical memory in contrast prospective memory is memory for future intentions or remembering to remember winograd 1988 prospective memory can be further broken down into event and time based prospective remembering time based prospective memories are triggered by a time cue such as going to the doctor action at 4pm cue event based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues such as remembering to post a letter action after seeing a mailbox cue cues do not need to be related to the action as the mailbox letter example and lists sticky notes knotted handkerchiefs or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory edit techniques used to study memory edit techniques used to assess infants memory infants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young children s memory throughout the years however researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants recognition memory and their recall memory habituation and operant conditioning techniques have been used to assess infants recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants recall memory techniques used to assess infants recognition memory visual paired comparison procedure relies on habituation infants are first presented with pairs of visual stimuli such as two black and white photos of human faces for a fixed amount of time then after being familiarized with the two photos they are presented with the familiar photo and a new photo the time spent looking at each photo is recorded looking longer at the new photo indicates that they remember the familiar one studies using this procedure have found that 5 to 6 month olds can retain information for as long as fourteen days 20 operant conditioning technique infants are placed in a crib and a ribbon that is connected to a mobile overhead is tied to one of their feet infants notice that when they kick their foot the mobile moves the rate of kicking increases dramatically within minutes studies using this technique have revealed that infants memory substantially improves over the first 18 months whereas 2 to 3 month olds can retain an operant response such as activating the mobile by kicking their foot for a week 6 month olds can retain it for two weeks and 18 month olds can retain a similar operant response for as long as 13 weeks 21 22 23 techniques used to assess infants recall memory deferred imitation technique an experimenter shows infants a unique sequence of actions such as using a stick to push a button on a box and then after a delay asks the infants to imitate the actions studies using deferred imitation have shown that 14 month olds memories for the sequence of actions can last for as long as four months 24 elicited imitation technique is very similar to the deferred imitation technique the difference is that infants are allowed to imitate the actions before the delay studies using the elicited imitation technique have shown that 20 month olds can recall the action sequences twelve months later 25 26 edit techniques used to assess older children and adults memory researchers use a variety of tasks to assess older children and adults memory some examples are paired associate learning when one learns to associate one specific word with another for example when given a word such as safe one must learn to say another specific word such as green this is stimulus and response 27 free recall during this task a subject would be asked to study a list of words and then sometime later they will be asked to recall or write down as many words that they can remember 28 earlier items are affected by retroactive interference or ri which means the longer the list the greater the interference and the less likelihood that they are recalled on the other hand items that have been presented lastly suffer little ri but suffers a great deal from proactive interference or pi which means the longer the delay in recall the more likely that the items will be lost 29 recognition subjects are asked to remember a list of words or pictures after which point they are asked to identify the previously presented words or pictures from among a list of alternatives that were not presented in the original list 30 detection paradigm individuals are shown a number of objects and colors samples during a certain period of time they are then tested on their visual ability to remember as much as they can by looking at testers and pointing out whether the testers are similar to the sample or if any change is present edit memory failures transience memories degrades with the passing of time this occurs in the storage stage of memory after the information has been stored and before it is retrieved this can happen in sensory short term and long term storage it follows a general pattern where the information is rapidly forgotten during the first couple of days or years followed by small losses in later days or years absentmindedness memory failure due to the lack of attention attention plays a key role in storing information into long term memory without proper attention the information might not be stored making it impossible to be retrieved later edit physiology brain areas involved in the neuroanatomy of memory such as the hippocampus the amygdala the striatum or the mammillary bodies are thought to be involved in specific types of memory for example the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory 31 damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information however rather than implicating a specific area it could be that damage to adjacent areas or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit further it is not sufficient to describe memory and its counterpart learning as solely dependent on specific brain regions learning and memory are attributed to changes in neuronal synapses thought to be mediated by long term potentiation and long term depression in general the more emotionally charged an event or experience is the better it is remembered this phenomenon is known as the memory enhancement effect patients with amygdala damage however do not show a memory enhancement effect 32 33 hebb distinguished between short term and long term memory he postulated that any memory that stayed in short term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long term memory later research showed this to be false research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences this is also true for stimulation of the amygdala this proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala excessive or prolonged stress with prolonged cortisol may hurt memory storage patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones the hippocampus is important for explicit memory the hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation the hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also the input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already hippocampal damage may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage 34 edit cognitive neuroscience of memory cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention reactivation and reconstruction of the experience independent internal representation the term of internal representation implies that such definition of memory contains two components the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level and the underpinning physical neural changes dudai 2007 the latter component is also called engram or memory traces semon 1904 some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory broadly conceiving all persisting after effects of experiences as memory others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought moscovitch 2007 one question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events byrne 2007 encoding encoding of working memory involves the spiking of individual neurons induced by sensory input which persists even after the sensory input disappears jensen and lisman 2005 fransen et al 2002 encoding of episodic memory involves persistent changes in molecular structures that alter synaptic transmission between neurons examples of such structural changes include long term potentiation ltp or spike timing dependent plasticity stdp the persistent spiking in working memory can enhance the synaptic and cellular changes in the encoding of episodic memory jensen and lisman 2005 working memory recent functional imaging studies detected working memory signals in both medial temporal lobe mtl a brain area strongly associated with long term memory and prefrontal cortex ranganath et al 2005 suggesting a strong relationship between working memory and long term memory however the substantially more working memory signals seen in the prefrontal lobe suggest that this area play a more important role in working memory than mtl suzuki 2007 consolidation and reconsolidation short term memory stm is temporary and subject to disruption while long term memory ltm once consolidated is persistent and stable consolidation of stm into ltm at the molecular level presumably involves two processes synaptic consolidation and system consolidation the former involves a protein synthesis process in the medial temporal lobe mtl whereas the latter transforms the mtl dependent memory into an mtl independent memory over months to years ledoux 2007 in recent years such traditional consolidation dogma has been re evaluated as a result of the studies on reconsolidation these studies showed that prevention after retrieval affects subsequent retrieval of the memory sara 2000 new studies have shown that post retrieval treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors and many other compounds can lead to an amnestic state nadel et al 2000b alberini 2005 dudai 2006 these findings on reconsolidation fit with the behavioral evidence that retrieved memory is not a carbon copy of the initial experiences and memories are updated during retrieval edit genetics study of the genetics of human memory is in its infancy a notable initial success was the association of apoe with memory dysfunction in alzheimer s disease the search for genes associated with normally varying memory continues one of the first candidates for normal variation in memory is the gene kibra 35 which appears to be associated with the rate at which material is forgotten over a delay period edit memory in infancy up until the middle of the 1980s it was assumed that infants could not encode retain and retrieve information 36 a growing body of research now indicates that infants as young as 6 months can recall information after a 24 hour delay 37 furthermore research has revealed that as infants grow older they can store information for longer periods of time 6 month olds can recall information after a 24 hour period 9 month olds after up to five weeks and 20 month olds after as long as twelve months 38 in addition studies have shown that with age infants can store information faster whereas 14 month olds can recall a three step sequence after being exposed to it once 6 month olds need approximately six exposures in order to be able to remember it 24 37 it should be noted that although 6 month olds can recall information over the short term they have difficulty recalling the temporal order of information it is only by 9 months of age that infants can recall the actions of a two step sequence in the correct temporal order that is recalling step 1 and then step 2 39 40 in other words when asked to imitate a two step action sequence such as putting a toy car in the base and pushing in the plunger to make the toy roll to the other end 9 month olds tend to imitate the actions of the sequence in the correct order step 1 and then step 2 younger infants 6 month olds can only recall one step of a two step sequence 37 researchers have suggested that these age differences are probably due to the fact that the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the frontal components of the neural network are not fully developed at the age of 6 months 41 42 43 edit memory and aging main article memory and aging one of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of memory loss especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of alzheimer s disease however memory loss is qualitatively different in normal aging from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of alzheimer s budson amp price 2005 research has revealed that individuals performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age older adults tend to exhibit deficits on tasks that involve knowing the temporal order in which they learned information 44 source memory tasks that require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information 45 and prospective memory tasks that involve remembering to perform an act at a future time older adults can manage their problems with prospective memory by using appointment books for example edit disorders much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders particularly amnesia loss of memory is known as amnesia amnesia can result from extensive damage to a the regions of the medial temporal lobe such as the hippocampus dentate gyrus subiculum amygdala the parahippocampal entorhinal and perirhinal cortices 46 or the b midline diencephalic region specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus 47 there are many sorts of amnesia and by studying their different forms it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub systems of the brain s memory systems and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain other neurological disorders such as alzheimer s disease and parkinson s disease 48 can also affect memory and cognition hyperthymesia or hyperthymesic syndrome is a disorder which affects an individual s autobiographical memory essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored 49 korsakoff s syndrome also known as korsakoff s psychosis amnesic confabulatory syndrome is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory while not a disorder a common temporary failure of word retrieval from memory is the tip of the tongue phenomenon sufferers of anomic aphasia also called nominal aphasia or anomia however do experience the tip of the tongue phenomenon on an ongoing basis due to damage to the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain edit factors that influence memory edit influence of odors and emotions in march 2007 german researchers found they could use odors to re activate new memories in the brains of people while they slept and the volunteers remembered better later 50 emotion can have a powerful impact on memory numerous studies have shown that the most vivid autobiographical memories tend to be of emotional events which are likely to be recalled more often and with more clarity and detail than neutral events 51 the part of the brain that is critical in creating the feeling of emotion is the amygdala which allows for stress hormones to strengthen neuron communication 52 the chemicals cortisone and adrenaline are released in the brain when the amygdala is activated by positive or negative excitement the most effective way to activate the amygdala is fear because fear is an instinctive protective mechanism which comes on strong making it memorable sometimes the feeling can be overwhelming this is when a memory can be hazy yet vivid or haunting with perfect clarity this discovery led to the development of a drug to help treat a disorder called ptsd post traumatic stress disorder 53 when someone is in a heightened emotional state the events causing it become strong and ground in the memory sometimes disrupting daily life for years 54 an experiment done with rats helped create the drug for treating this issue dr kerry ressler at emory university used tones and shocks to test an existing drug called dicyclomine used commonly for tuberculosis rats would hear a tone and receive a mild shock training them to fear the tone then the drug was given to one set of rats and the tests were done again the rats that did not receive the drug froze in fear when the tone was heard the rats given the drug ignored the tone and continued on 55 the drug can effectively allow for new receptor connections between neurons and relaxing of the amygdala when it comes to fear allowing patients to have a chance of recovery from ptsd dr barbara rothbaum at emory university conducts experimental treatments for ptsd using the knowledge that exactly the same neurons are active when remembering an event as when it was created her administration of the drug dicyclomine is intended to help patients foster new connections between neurons providing a window to lessen former traumatic connections rothbaum decided to use the drug in a therapy session that utilizes virtual reality to give ptsd suffers a second chance once the events that have caused the ptsd are identified the process can begin the surroundings of the events are recreated in a virtual reality helmet for instance in a combat vehicle in the desert 56 this would help to recall the target memories in a safe environment and activate the neurons without activating the fear response from the amygdala when the dicyclomine is in the patient s system and the same neurons are active that were active during the event the patient can now have a chance to re form neural connections with less chemicals present from the amygdala this does not erase the memory but rather lessens the strength of it giving some relief so that people suffering from ptsd can try to move on and live their lives recall is linked with emotion if pain joy excitement or any other strong emotion is present during an event the neurons active during this event produce strong connections with each other when this event is remembered or recalled in the future the neurons will more easily and speedily make the same connections the strength and longevity of memories is directly related to the amount of emotion felt during the event of their creation 57 this understanding helps the future of healthy and effective solutions to memory problems like ptsd citation needed edit interference from previous knowledge at the center for cognitive science at ohio state university researchers have found that memory accuracy of adults is hurt by the fact that they know more and have more experience than children and tend to apply all this knowledge when learning new information the findings appeared in the august 2004 edition of the journal psychological science interference can hamper memorization and retrieval there is retroactive interference when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information 58 and proactive interference where prior learning disrupts recall of new information although interference can lead to forgetting it is important to keep in mind that there are situations when old information can facilitate learning of new information knowing latin for instance can help an individual learn a related language such as french this phenomenon is known as positive transfer 59 edit memory and stress stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning in response to stressful situations the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters ex glucocorticoids and catecholamines which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats 60 an experimental study by german cognitive psychologists l schwabe and o wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans 61 in this study 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water the reputable secpt or socially evaluated cold pressor test for up to three minutes while being monitored and videotaped both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize twenty four hours later both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember free recall as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words recognition performance the results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group who recalled 30 fewer words than the control group the researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process however memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context even when learning occurs under stress a separate study by cognitive psychologists schwabe and wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task i e in the same room memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated 62 seventy two healthy female and male university students randomly assigned to the secpt stress test or to a control group were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards a computerized version of the card game concentration or memory the room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla as odour is a strong cue for memory retention testing took place the following day either in the same room with the vanilla scent again present or in a different room without the fragrance the memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent an incongruent context however the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent a congruent context all participants in the experiment both stressed and unstressed performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar 63 this research on the effects of stress on memory may have practical implications for education for eyewitness testimony and for psychotherapy students may perform better when tested in their regular classroom rather than an exam room eyewitnesses may recall details better at the scene of an event than in a courtroom and persons suffering from post traumatic stress may improve when helped to situate their memories of a traumatic event in an appropriate context edit memory construction although we like to think that our memory operates like recording equipment that is not actually the case the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime 64 in fact research has revealed that our memories are constructed people can construct their memories when they encode them and or when they recall them to illustrate consider a classic study conducted by elizabeth loftus and john palmer 1974 65 in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw the researchers found that those people who were asked how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other gave higher estimates than those who were asked how fast were the cars going when they hit each other furthermore when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they have seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit there was no broken glass depicted in the film thus the wording of the questions distorted viewers memories of the event importantly the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event those who were asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen the findings of this experiment were replicated around the world and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect 66 interestingly research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories for instance goff and roediger 67 1998 asked participants to imagine that they performed an act e g break a toothpick and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment similarly garry and her colleagues 1996 68 asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children e g broke a window with their hand and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events the researchers found that one fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children that is when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events edit improving memory main article improving memory a ucla research study published in the june 2006 issue of the american journal of geriatric psychiatry found that people can improve cognitive function and brain efficiency through simple lifestyle changes such as incorporating memory exercises healthy eating physical fitness and stress reduction into their daily lives this study examined 17 subjects average age 53 with normal memory performance eight subjects were asked to follow a brain healthy diet relaxation physical and mental exercise brain teasers and verbal memory training techniques after 14 days they showed greater word fluency not memory compared to their baseline performance no long term follow up was conducted it is therefore unclear if this intervention has lasting effects on memory 69 there are a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques that can be used to vastly improve memory known as the art of memory the international longevity center released in 2001 a report 70 which includes in pages 14 16 recommendations for keeping the mind in good functionality until advanced age some of the recommendations are to stay intellectually active through learning training or reading to keep physically active so to promote blood circulation to the brain to socialize to reduce stress to keep sleep time regular to avoid depression or emotional instability and to observe good nutrition edit levels of processing main article levels of processing effect craik and lockhart 1972 proposed that it is the method and depth of processing that affects how an experience is stored in memory rather than rehearsal organization mandler 1967 gave participants a pack of word cards and asked them to sort them into any number of piles using any system of categorisation they liked when they were later asked to recall as many of the words as they could those who used more categories remembered more words this study suggested that the organization of memory is one of its central aspects mandler 2011 distinctiveness eysenck and eysenck 1980 asked participants to say words in a distinctive way e g spell the words out loud such participants recalled the words better than those who simply read them off a list effort tyler et al 1979 had participants solve a series of anagrams some easy fahter and some difficult hrefat the participants recalled the difficult anagrams better presumably because they put more effort into them elaboration palmere et al 1983 gave participants descriptive paragraphs of a fictitious african nation there were some short paragraphs and some with extra sentences elaborating the main idea recall was higher for the ideas in the elaborated paragraphs edit methods to optimize memorization memorization is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim rote learning is the method most often used methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers such as cosmos rossellius using visual alphabets the spacing effect shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time in contrast to this is cramming which is intensive memorization in a short period of time also relevant is the zeigarnik effect which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones the so called method of loci uses spatial memory to memorize non spatial information 71 edit see also politics of memory edit footnotes sperling g 1963 a model for visual memory tasks http hfs sagepub com content 5 1 19 short cited by 5 1 19 31 carlson neil r 2010
