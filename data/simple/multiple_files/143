called cluster are more similar in some sense or another to each other than to those in other groups clusters it is a main task of exploratory data mining and a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields including machine learning pattern recognition image analysis information retrieval and bioinformatics cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm but the general task to be solved it can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their notion of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances among the cluster members dense areas of the data space intervals or particular statistical distributions clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi objective optimization problem the appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings including values such as the distance function to use a density threshold or the number of expected clusters depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi objective optimization that involves trial and failure it will often be necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties besides the term clustering there are a number of terms with similar meanings including automatic classification numerical taxonomy botryology from greek grape and typological analysis the subtle differences are often in the usage of the results while in data mining the resulting groups are the matter of interest in automatic classification primarily their discriminative power is of interest this often leads to misunderstandings between researchers coming from the fields of data mining and machine learning since they use the same terms and often the same algorithms but have different goals contents 1

and clusterings the notion of a cluster cannot be precisely defined 1 which is one of the reasons why there are so many clustering algorithms there of course is a common denominator a group of data objects however different researchers employ different cluster models and for each of these cluster models again different algorithms can be given the notion of a cluster as found by different algorithms varies significantly in its properties understanding these cluster models is key to understanding the differences between the various algorithms typical cluster models include connectivity models for example hierarchical clustering builds models based on distance connectivity centroid models for example the k means algorithm represents each cluster by a single mean vector distribution models clusters are modeled using statistical distributions such as multivariate normal distributions used by the expectation maximization algorithm density models for example dbscan and optics defines clusters as connected dense regions in the data space subspace models in biclustering also known as co clustering or two mode clustering clusters are modeled with both cluster members and relevant attributes group models some algorithms unfortunately do not provide a refined model for their results and just provide the grouping information graph based models a clique i e a subset of nodes in a graph such that every two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge can be considered as a prototypical form of cluster relaxations of the complete connectivity requirement a fraction of the edges can be missing are known as quasi cliques a clustering is essentially a set of such clusters usually containing all objects in the data set additionally it may specify the relationship of the clusters to each other for example a hierarchy of clusters embedded in each other clusterings can be roughly distinguished in hard clustering each object belongs to a cluster or not soft clustering also fuzzy clustering each object belongs to each cluster to a certain degree e g 160 a likelihood of belonging to the cluster there are also finer distinctions possible for example strict partitioning clustering here each object belongs to exactly one cluster strict partitioning clustering with outliers objects can also belong to no cluster and are considered outliers overlapping clustering also alternative clustering multi view clustering while usually a hard clustering objects may belong to more than one cluster hierarchical clustering objects that belong to a child cluster also belong to the parent cluster subspace clustering while an overlapping clustering within a uniquely defined subspace clusters are not expected to overlap edit clustering algorithms clustering algorithms can be categorized based on their cluster model as listed above the following overview will only list the most prominent examples of clustering algorithms as there are probably a few dozen if not over 100 published clustering algorithms not all provide models for their clusters and can thus not easily be categorized an overview of algorithms explained in wikipedia can be found in the list of statistics algorithms there is no objectively correct clustering algorithm but as it was noted clustering is in the eye of the beholder 1 the most appropriate clustering algorithm for a particular problem often needs to be chosen experimentally unless there is a mathematical reason to prefer one cluster model over another it should be noted that an algorithm that is designed for one kind of models has no chance on a data set that contains a radically different kind of models 1 for example k means cannot find non convex clusters 1 edit connectivity based clustering hierarchical clustering main article hierarchical clustering connectivity based clustering also known as hierarchical clustering is based on the core idea of objects being more related to nearby objects than to objects farther away as such these algorithms connect objects to form clusters based on their distance a cluster can be described largely by the maximum distance needed to connect parts of the cluster at different distances different clusters will form which can be represented using a dendrogram which explains where the common name hierarchical clustering comes from these algorithms do not provide a single partitioning of the data set but instead provide an extensive hierarchy of clusters that merge with each other at certain distances in a dendrogram the y axis marks the distance at which the clusters merge while the objects are placed along the x axis such that the clusters don t mix connectivity based clustering is a whole family of methods that differ by the way distances are computed apart from the usual choice of distance functions the user also needs to decide on the linkage criterion since a cluster consists of multiple objects there are multiple candidates to compute the distance to to use popular choices are known as single linkage clustering the minimum of object distances complete linkage clustering the maximum of object distances or upgma unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean also known as average linkage clustering furthermore hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative starting with single elements and aggregating them into clusters or divisive starting with the complete data set and dividing it into partitions while these methods are fairly easy to understand the results are not always easy to use as they will not produce a unique partitioning of the data set but a hierarchy the user still needs to choose appropriate clusters from the methods are not very robust towards outliers which will either show up as additional clusters or even cause other clusters to merge known as chaining phenomenon in particular with single linkage clustering in the general case the complexity is which makes them too slow for large data sets for some special cases optimal efficient methods of complexity are known slink 2 for single linkage and clink 3 for complete linkage clustering in the data mining community these methods are recognized as a theoretical foundation of cluster analysis but often considered obsolete they did however provide inspiration for many later methods such as density based clustering linkage clustering examples single linkage on gaussian data at 35 clusters the biggest cluster starts fragmenting into smaller parts while before it was still connected to the second largest due to the single link effect single linkage on density based clusters 20 clusters extracted most of which contain single elements since linkage clustering does not have a notion of noise edit centroid based clustering main article k means clustering in centroid based clustering clusters are represented by a central vector which may not necessarily be a member of the data set when the number of clusters is fixed to k k means clustering gives a formal definition as an optimization problem find the cluster centers and assign the objects to the nearest cluster center such that the squared distances from the cluster are minimized the optimization problem itself is known to be np hard and thus the common approach is to search only for approximate solutions a particularly well known approximative method is lloyd s algorithm 4 often actually referred to as k means algorithm it does however only find a local optimum and is commonly run multiple times with different random initializations variations of k means often include such optimizations as choosing the best of multiple runs but also restricting the centroids to members of the data set k medoids choosing medians k medians clustering choosing the initial centers less randomly k means or allowing a fuzzy cluster assignment fuzzy c means most k means type algorithms require the number of clusters to be specified in advance which is considered to be one of the biggest drawbacks of these algorithms furthermore the algorithms prefer clusters of approximately similar size as they will always assign an object to the nearest centroid this often leads to incorrectly cut borders in between of clusters which is not surprising as the algorithm optimized cluster centers not cluster borders k means has a number of interesting theoretical properties on one hand it partitions the data space into a structure known as voronoi diagram on the other hand it is conceptually close to nearest neighbor classification and as such popular in machine learning third it can be seen as a variation of model based classification and lloyd s algorithm as a variation of the expectation maximization algorithm for this model discussed below k means clustering examples k means separates data into voronoi cells which assumes equal sized clusters not adequate here k means cannot represent density based clusters edit distribution based clustering the clustering model most closely related to statistics is based on distribution models clusters can then easily be defined as objects belonging most likely to the same distribution a nice property of this approach is that this closely resembles the way artificial data sets are generated by sampling random objects from a distribution while the theoretical foundation of these methods is excellent they suffer from one key problem known as overfitting unless constraints are put on the model complexity a more complex model will usually always be able to explain the data better which makes choosing the appropriate model complexity inherently difficult the most prominent method is known as expectation maximization algorithm or short em clustering here the data set is usually modeled with a fixed to avoid overfitting number of gaussian distributions that are initialized randomly and whose parameters are iteratively optimized to fit better to the data set this will converge to a local optimum so multiple runs may produce different results in order to obtain a hard clustering objects are often then assigned to the gaussian distribution they most likely belong to for soft clusterings this is not necessary distribution based clustering is a semantically strong method as it not only provides you with clusters but also produces complex models for the clusters that can also capture correlation and dependence of attributes however using these algorithms puts an extra burden on the user to choose appropriate data models to optimize and for many real data sets there may be no mathematical model available the algorithm is able to optimize e g assuming gaussian distributions is a rather strong assumption on the data em clustering examples on gaussian distributed data em works well since it uses gaussians for modelling clusters density based clusters cannot be modeled using gaussian distributions edit density based clustering in density based clustering 5 clusters are defined as areas of higher density than the remainder of the data set objects in these sparse areas that are required to separate clusters are usually considered to be noise and border points the most popular 6 density based clustering method is dbscan 7 in contrast to many newer methods it features a well defined cluster model called density reachability similar to linkage based clustering it is based on connecting points within certain distance thresholds however it only connects points that satisfy a density criterion in the original variant defined as a minimum number of other objects within this radius a cluster consists of all density connected objects which can form a cluster of an arbitrary shape in contrast to many other methods plus all objects that are within these objects range another interesting property of dbscan is that its complexity is fairly low it requires a linear number of range queries on the database and that it will discover essentially the same results it is deterministic for core and noise points but not for border points in each run therefore there is no need to run it multiple times optics 8 is a generalization of dbscan that removes the need to choose an appropriate value for the range parameter and produces a hierarchical result related to that of linkage clustering deli clu 9 density link clustering combines ideas from single linkage clustering and optics eliminating the parameter entirely and offering performance improvements over optics by using an r tree index the key drawback of dbscan and optics is that they expect some kind of density drop to detect cluster borders moreover they can not detect intrinsic cluster structures which are prevalent in the majority of real life data a variation of dbscan endbscan 10 efficiently detects such kinds of structures on data sets with for example overlapping gaussian distributions a common use case in artificial data the cluster borders produced by these algorithms will often look arbitrary because the cluster density decreases continuously on a data set consisting of mixtures of gaussians these algorithms are nearly always outperformed by methods such as em clustering that are able to precisely model this kind of data density based clustering examples density based clustering with dbscan dbscan assumes clusters of similar density and may have problems separating nearby clusters optics is a dbscan variant that handles different densities much better edit newer developments in recent years considerable effort has been put into improving algorithm performance of the existing algorithms 11 among them are clarans ng and han 1994 12 and birch zhang et al 1996 13 with the recent need to process larger and larger data sets also known as big data the willingness to treat semantic meaning of the generated clusters for performance has been increasing this led to the development of pre clustering methods such as canopy clustering which can process huge data sets efficiently but the resulting clusters are merely a rough pre partitioning of the data set to then analyze the partitions with existing slower methods such as k means clustering various other approaches to clustering have been tried such as seed based clustering 14 for high dimensional data many of the existing methods fail due to the curse of dimensionality which renders particular distance functions problematic in high dimensional spaces this led to new clustering algorithms for high dimensional data that focus on subspace clustering where only some attributes are used and cluster models include the relevant attributes for the cluster and correlation clustering that also looks for arbitrary rotated correlated subspace clusters that can be modeled by giving a correlation of their attributes examples for such clustering algorithms are clique 15 and subclu 16 ideas from density based clustering methods in particular the dbscan optics family of algorithms have been adopted to subspace clustering hisc 17 hierarchical subspace clustering and dish 18 and correlation clustering hico 19 hierarchical corelation clustering 4c 20 using correlation connectivity and eric 21 exploring hierarchical density based correlation clusters several different clustering systems based on mutual information have been proposed one is marina meil s variation of information metric 22 another provides hierarchical clustering 23 using genetic algorithms a wide range of different fit functions can be optimized including mutual information 24 also message passing algorithms a recent development in computer science and statistical physics has led to the creation of new types of clustering algorithms 25 edit evaluation of clustering results evaluation of clustering results sometimes is referred to as cluster validation there have been several suggestions for a measure of similarity between two clusterings such a measure can be used to compare how well different data clustering algorithms perform on a set of data these measures are usually tied to the type of criterion being considered in assessing the quality of a clustering method edit internal evaluation when a clustering result is evaluated based on the data that was clustered itself this is called internal evaluation these methods usually assign the best score to the algorithm that produces clusters with high similarity within a cluster and low similarity between clusters one drawback of using internal criteria in cluster evaluation is that high scores on an internal measure do not necessarily result in effective information retrieval applications 26 additionally this evaluation is biased towards algorithms that use the same cluster model for example k means clustering naturally optimizes object distances and a distance based internal criterion will likely overrate the resulting clustering therefore the internal evaluation measures are best suited to get some insight into situations where one algorithm performs better than another but this shall not imply that one algorithm produces more valid results than another 1 validity as measured by such an index depends on the claim that this kind of structure exists in the data set an algorithm designed for some kind of models has no chance if the data set contains a radically different set of models or if the evaluation measures a radically different criterion 1 for example k means clustering can only find convex clusters and many evaluation indexes assume convex clusters on a data set with non convex clusters neither the use of k means nor of an evaluation criterion that assumes convexity is sound the following methods can be used to assess the quality of clustering algorithms based on internal criterion davies bouldin index the davies bouldin index can be calculated by the following formula where n is the number of clusters is the centroid of cluster is the average distance of all elements in cluster to centroid and is the distance between centroids and since algorithms that produce clusters with low intra cluster distances high intra cluster similarity and high inter cluster distances low inter cluster similarity will have a low davies bouldin index the clustering algorithm that produces a collection of clusters with the smallest davies bouldin index is considered the best algorithm based on this criterion dunn index j c dunn 1974 the dunn index aims to identify dense and well separated clusters it is defined as the ratio between the minimal inter cluster distance to maximal intra cluster distance for each cluster partition the dunn index can be calculated by the following formula 27 where represents the distance between clusters and and measures the intra cluster distance of cluster the inter cluster distance between two clusters may be any number of distance measures such as the distance between the centroids of the clusters similarly the intra cluster distance may be measured in a variety ways such as the maximal distance between any pair of elements in cluster since internal criterion seek clusters with high intra cluster similarity and low inter cluster similarity algorithms that produce clusters with high dunn index are more desirable edit external evaluation in external evaluation clustering results are evaluated based on data that was not used for clustering such as known class labels and external benchmarks such benchmarks consist of a set of pre classified items and these sets are often created by human experts thus the benchmark sets can be thought of as a gold standard for evaluation these types of evaluation methods measure how close the clustering is to the predetermined benchmark classes however it has recently been discussed whether this is adequate for real data or only on synthetic data sets with a factual ground truth since classes can contain internal structure the attributes present may not allow separation of clusters or the classes may contain anomalies 28 additionally from a knowledge discovery point of view the reproduction of known knowledge may not necessarily be the intended result 28 some of the measures of quality of a cluster algorithm using external criterion include rand measure william m rand 1971 29 the rand index computes how similar the clusters returned by the clustering algorithm are to the benchmark classifications one can also view the rand index as a measure of the percentage of correct decisions made by the algorithm it can be computed using the following formula where is the number of true positives is the number of true negatives is the number of false positives and is the number of false negatives one issue with the rand index is that false positives and false negatives are equally weighted this may be an undesirable characteristic for some clustering applications the f measure addresses this concern f measure the f measure can be used to balance the contribution of false negatives by weighting recall through a parameter let precision and recall be defined as follows where is the precision rate and is the recall rate we can calculate the f measure by using the following formula 26 notice that when in other words recall has no impact on the f measure when and increasing allocates an increasing amount of weight to recall in the final f measure pair counting f measure is the f measure applied to the set of object pairs where objects are paired with each other when they are part of the same cluster this measure is able to compare clusterings with different numbers of clusters jaccard index the jaccard index is used to quantify the similarity between two datasets the jaccard index takes on a value between 0 and 1 an index of 1 means that the two dataset are identical and an index of 0 indicates that the datasets have no common elements the jaccard index is defined by the following formula this is simply the number of unique elements common to both sets divided by the total number of unique elements in both sets fowlkes mallows index e b fowlkes amp c l mallows 1983 30 the fowlkes mallows index computes the similarity between the clusters returned by the clustering algorithm and the benchmark classifications the higher the value of the fowlkes mallows index the more similar the clusters and the benchmark classifications are it can be computed using the following formula where is the number of true positives is the number of false positives and is the number of false negatives the index is the geometric mean of the precision and recall and while the f measure is their harmonic mean 31 moreover precision and recall are also known as wallace s indices and 32 confusion matrix a confusion matrix can be used to quickly visualize the results of a classification or clustering algorithm it shows how different a cluster is from the gold standard cluster the mutual information is an information theoretic measure of how much information is shared between a clustering and a ground truth classification that can detect a non linear similarity between two clusterings adjusted mutual information is the corrected for chance variant of this that has a reduced bias for varying cluster numbers edit applications biology computational biology and bioinformatics plant and animal ecology cluster analysis is used to describe and to make spatial and temporal comparisons of communities assemblages of organisms in heterogeneous environments it is also used in plant systematics to generate artificial phylogenies or clusters of organisms individuals at the species genus or higher level that share a number of attributes transcriptomics clustering is used to build groups of genes with related expression patterns also known as coexpressed genes often such groups contain functionally related proteins such as enzymes for a specific pathway or genes that are co regulated high throughput experiments using expressed sequence tags ests or dna microarrays can be a powerful tool for genome annotation a general aspect of genomics sequence analysis clustering is used to group homologous sequences into gene families this is a very important concept in bioinformatics and evolutionary biology in general see evolution by gene duplication high throughput genotyping platforms clustering algorithms are used to automatically assign genotypes human genetic clustering the similarity of genetic data is used in clustering to infer population structures medicine medical imaging on pet scans cluster analysis can be used to differentiate between different types of tissue and blood in a three dimensional image in this application actual position does not matter but the voxel intensity is considered as a vector with a dimension for each image that was taken over time this technique allows for example accurate measurement of the rate a radioactive tracer is delivered to the area of interest without a separate sampling of arterial blood an intrusive technique that is most common today imrt segmentation clustering can be used to divide a fluence map into distinct regions for conversion into deliverable

in the study of social networks clustering may be used to recognize communities within large groups of people search result grouping in the process of intelligent grouping of the files and websites clustering may be used to create a more relevant set of search results compared to normal search engines like google there are currently a number of web based clustering tools such as clusty slippy map optimization flickr s map of photos and other map sites use clustering to reduce the number of markers on a map this makes it both faster and reduces the amount of visual clutter computer science software evolution clustering is useful in software evolution as it helps to reduce legacy properties in code by reforming functionality that has become dispersed it is a form of restructuring and hence is a way of directly preventative maintenance image segmentation clustering can be used to divide a digital image into distinct regions for border detection or object recognition evolutionary algorithms clustering may be used to identify different niches within the population of an evolutionary algorithm so that reproductive opportunity can be distributed more evenly amongst the evolving species or subspecies recommender systems recommender systems are designed to recommend new items based on a user s tastes they sometimes use clustering algorithms to predict a user s preferences

crime analysis cluster analysis can be used to identify areas where there are greater incidences of particular types of crime by identifying these distinct areas or hot spots where a similar crime has happened over a period of time it is possible to manage law enforcement resources more effectively educational data mining cluster analysis is for example used to identify groups of schools or
