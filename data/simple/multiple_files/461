in text processing a proximity search looks for documents where two or more separately matching term occurrences are within a specified distance where distance is the number of intermediate words or characters in addition to proximity some implementations may also impose a constraint on the word order in that the order in the searched text must be identical to the order of the search query proximity searching goes beyond the simple matching of words by adding the constraint of proximity and is generally regarded as a form of advanced search for example a search could be used to find red brick house and match phrases such as red house of brick or house made of red brick by limiting the proximity these phrases can be matched while avoiding documents where the words are scattered or spread across a page or in unrelated articles in an anthology contents 1 rationale 2 boolean syntax and operators 3 usage in commercial search engines 4 see also 5 notes edit rationale the basic linguistic assumption of proximity searching is that the proximity of the words in a document implies a relationship between the words given that authors of documents try to formulate sentences which contain a single idea or cluster of related ideas within neighboring sentences or organized into paragraphs there is an inherent relatively high probability within the document structure that words used together are related on the other hand when two words are on the opposite ends of a book the probability of a relationship between the words is relatively weak by limiting search results to only include matches where the words are within the specified maximum proximity or distance the search results are assumed to be of higher relevance than the matches where the words are scattered commercial internet search engines tend to produce too many matches known as recall for the average search query proximity searching is one method of reducing the number of pages matches and to improve the relevance of the matched pages by using word proximity to assist in ranking as an added benefit proximity searching helps combat spamdexing by avoiding webpages which contain dictionary lists or shotgun lists of thousands of words which would otherwise rank highly if the search engine was heavily biased toward word frequency edit boolean syntax and operators note that a proximity search can designate that only some keywords must be within a specified distance proximity searching can be used with other search syntax and or controls to allow more articulate search queries sometimes query operators like near not near followed by not followed by sentence or far are used to indicate a proximity search limit between specified keywords for example brick near house edit usage in commercial search engines in regards to implicit automatic versus explicit proximity search as of november 2008 most internet search engines only implement an implicit proximity search functionality that is they automatically rank those search results higher where the user keywords have a good overall proximity score in such results if only two keywords are in the search query this has no difference from an explicit proximity search which puts a near operator between the two keywords however if three or more than three keywords are present it is often important for the user to specify which subsets of these keywords expect a proximity in search results this is useful if the user wants to do a prior art search e g finding an existing approach to complete a specific task finding a document that discloses a system that exhibits a procedural behavior collaboratively conducted by several components and links between these components web search engines which support proximity search via an explicit proximity operator in their query language include walhello exalead yandex yahoo and altavista when using the walhello search engine the proximity can be defined by the number of characters between the keywords 1 the search engine exalead allows the user to specify the required proximity as the maximum number of words between keywords the syntax is keyword1 near n keyword2 where n is the number of words 2 yandex uses the syntax keyword1 n keyword2 to search for two keywords separated by at most words and supports a few other variations of this syntax 3 yahoo and altavista both support an undocumented near operator 4 5 the syntax is keyword1 near keyword2 google supports around ordered search within the google and yahoo search engines is possible using the asterisk full word wildcards in google this matches one or more words 6 and an in yahoo search this matches exactly one word 7 this is easily verified by searching for the following phrase in both google and yahoo addictive of biblioscopy to emulate unordered search of the near operator can be done using a combination of ordered searches for example to specify a close co occurrence of house and dog the following search expression could be specified house dog or dog house or house dog or dog house or house dog or dog house edit see also compound term processing edit distance information
