fuzzy retrieval techniques are based on the extended boolean model and the fuzzy set theory there are two classical fuzzy retrieval models mixed min and max mmm and the paice model both models do not provide a way of evaluating query weights however this is considered by the p norms algorithm contents 1 mixed min and max model mmm 2 paice model 3 improvements over the standard boolean model 4 recent work 5 see also 6 further reading 7 references edit mixed min and max model mmm in fuzzy set theory an element has a varying degree of membership say d a to a given set a instead of the traditional membership choice is an element is not an element in mmm 1 each index term has a fuzzy set associated with it a document s weight with respect to an index term a is considered to be the degree of membership of the document in the fuzzy set associated with a the degree of membership for union and intersection are defined as follows in fuzzy set theory according to this documents that should be retrieved for a query of the form a or b should be in the fuzzy set associated with the union of the two sets a and b similarly the documents that should be retrieved for a query of the form a and b should be in the fuzzy set associated with the intersection of the two sets hence it is possible to define the similarity of a document to the or query to be max d a d b and the similarity of the document to the and query to be min d a d b the mmm model tries to soften the boolean operators by considering the query document similarity to be a linear combination of the min and max document weights given a document d with index term weights d a1 d a2 d an for terms a 1 a 2 a n and the queries q or a 1 or a 2 or or a n q and a 1 and a 2 and and a n the query document similarity in the mmm model is computed as follows slm q or d c or1 max d a1 d a2 d an c or2 min d a1 d a2 d an slm q and d c and1 min d a1 d a2 d an c and2 max d a1 d a2 d an where c or1 c or2 are softness coefficients for the or operator and c and1 c and2 are softness coefficients for the and operator since we would like to give the maximum of the document weights more importance while considering an or query and the minimum more importance while considering an and query generally we have c or1 gt c or2 and c and1 gt c and2 for simplicity it is generally assumed that c or1 1 c or2 and c and1 1 c and2 lee and fox 2 experiments indicate that the best performance usually occurs with c and1 in the range 0 5 0 8 and with c or1 gt 0 2 in general the computational cost of mmm is low and retrieval effectiveness is much better than with the standard boolean model edit paice model the paice model 3 is a general extension to the mmm model in comparison to the mmm model that considers only the minimum and maximum weights for the index terms the paice model incorporates all of the term weights when calculating the similarity where r is a constant coefficient and w di is arranged in ascending order for and queries and descending order for or queries when n 2 the paice model shows the same behavior as the mmm model the experiments of lee and fox 2 have shown that setting the r to 1 0 for and queries and 0 7 for or queries gives good retrieval effectiveness the computational cost for this model is higher than that for the mmm model this is because the mmm model only requires the determination of min or max of a set of term weights each time an and or or clause is considered which can be done in o n the paice model requires the term weights to be sorted in ascending or descending order depending on whether an and clause or an or clause is being considered this requires at least an 0 n log n sorting algorithm a good deal of floating point calculation is needed too edit improvements over the standard boolean model lee and fox 2 compared the standard boolean model with mmm and paice models with three test collections cisi cacm and inspec these are the reported results for average mean precision improvement cisi cacm inspec mmm 68 109 195 paice 77 104 206 these are very good improvements over the standard model mmm is very close to paice and p norm results which indicates that it can be a very good technique and is the most efficient of the three edit recent work recently kang et al 4 have devised a fuzzy retrieval system indexed by concept identification if we look at documents on a pure tf idf approach even eliminating stop words there will be words more relevant to the topic of the document than others and they will have the same weight because they have the same term frequency if we take into account the user intent on a query we can better weight the terms of a document each term can be identified as a concept in a certain lexical chain that translates the importance of that concept for that document they report improvements over paice and p norm on the average precision and recall for the top 5 retrieved documents zadrozny 5 revisited the fuzzy information retrieval model he further extends the fuzzy extended boolean model by assuming linguistic terms as importance weights of keywords also in documents taking into account the uncertainty concerning the representation of documents and queries interpreting the linguistic terms in the representation of documents and queries as well as their matching in terms of the zadeh s fuzzy logic calculus of linguistic statements addressing some pragmatic aspects of the proposed model notably the techniques of indexing documents and queries the proposed model makes it possible to grasp both imprecision and uncertainty concerning the textual information representation and retrieval edit see also information retrieval edit further reading fox e s betrabet m koushik w lee 1992 information
