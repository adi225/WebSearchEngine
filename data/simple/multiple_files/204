1570 the british isles and scandinavia are not included in europe proper the use of the term europe has developed gradually throughout history 7 8 in antiquity the greek historian herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts europe asia and libya africa with the nile and the river phasis forming their boundaries though he also states that some considered the river don rather than the phasis as the boundary between europe and asia 9 europe s eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer strabo at the river don 10 flavius and the book of jubilees described the continents as the lands given by noah to his three sons europe was defined as stretching from the pillars of hercules at the strait of gibraltar separating it from north africa to the don separating it from asia 11 a cultural definition of europe as the lands of latin christendom coalesced in the 8th century signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of germanic traditions and christian latin culture defined partly in contrast with byzantium and islam and limited to northern iberia the british isles france christianized western germany the alpine regions and northern and central italy 12 the concept is one of the lasting legacies of the carolingian renaissance europa often figures in the letters of charlemagne s cultural minister alcuin 13 this division as much cultural as geographical was used until the late middle ages when it was challenged by the age of discovery 14 15 why the problem of redefining europe was finally resolved in 1730 when instead of waterways the swedish geographer and cartographer von strahlenberg proposed the ural mountains as the most significant eastern boundary a suggestion that found favour in russia and throughout europe 16 europe is now generally defined by geographers as the westernmost peninsula of eurasia with its boundaries marked by large bodies of water to the north west and south europe s limits to the far east are usually taken to be the urals the ural river and the caspian sea to the south east including the caucasus mountains the black sea and the waterways connecting the black sea to the mediterranean sea 17 because of sociopolitical and cultural differences there are various descriptions of europe s boundary for example cyprus is approximate to anatolia or asia minor but is usually considered part of europe and currently is a member state of the eu in addition malta was considered an island of north africa for centuries 18 while iceland though nearer to greenland north america is also generally included in europe sometimes the word europe is used in a geopolitically limiting way 19 to refer only to the european union or even more exclusively a culturally defined core on the other hand the council of europe has 47 member countries and only 27 member states are in the eu 20 in addition people living in areas such as ireland the united kingdom the north atlantic and mediterranean islands and also in scandinavia may routinely refer to continental or mainland europe simply as europe or the continent 21 clickable map of europe showing one of

abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull he took her to the island of crete where she gave birth to minos rhadamanthus and sarpedon for homer europe ancient greek eur p see also list of greek place names was a mythological queen of crete not a geographical designation the etymology of europa is uncertain 24 one theory suggests that it is derived from the greek eurus meaning wide broad 25 and ps p opt meaning eye face countenance 26 hence eur p wide gazing broad of aspect compare with glauk p is grey eyed athena or bo p is ox eyed hera broad has been an epithet of earth itself in the reconstructed proto indo european religion 27 another theory suggests that it is based on a semitic word such as the akkadian erebu meaning to go down set cf occident 28 cognate to phoenician ereb evening west and arabic maghreb hebrew ma ariv see also erebus pie h 1 reg os darkness however martin litchfield west states that phonologically the match between europa s name and any form of the semitic word is very poor 29 whatever the origin of the name of the mythological figure is first used as a geographical term in the 6th century bc by greek geographers such as anaximander and hecataeus anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river the modern rioni in the caucasus a convention still followed by herodotus in the 5th century bc 30 but the convention received by the middle ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the roman era used by roman era authors such as posidonius 31 strabo 32 and ptolemy 33 who took the tanais the modern don river as the boundary the term europe is first used for a cultural sphere in the carolingian renaissance 160 of the 9th century from that time the term designated the sphere of influence of the western church as opposed to both the eastern orthodox 160 churches and to the islamic world the modern convention enlarging the area of europe somewhat to the east and the south east develops in the 19th century most major world languages use words derived from europa to refer to the continent peninsula chinese for example uses the word uzh u this term is also used by the european union in japanese language diplomatic relations despite the katakana y roppa being more commonly used however in some turkic languages the originally persian name frangistan land of the franks is used casually in referring to much of europe besides official names such as avrupa or evropa 34 history main article history of europe prehistory main article prehistoric europe gantija malta the lady of vin a

were supplanted by modern humans cro magnons who appeared in europe around 43 to 40 thousand years ago 37 the european neolithic period marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery began around 7000 bc in greece and the balkans probably influenced by earlier farming practices in anatolia and the near east it spread from the balkans along the valleys of the danube and the rhine linear pottery culture and along the mediterranean coast cardial culture between 4500 and 3000 bc these central european neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artefacts in western europe the neolithic period was characterized not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments such as causewayed enclosures burial mounds and megalithic tombs 38 the corded ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the neolithic to the

refer to this as the dark ages 50 isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously apart from this very few written records survive and much literature philosophy mathematics and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from europe 51 europe around 650 from the 7th century byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of islam and the caliphates muslim arabs first invaded historically roman territory under ab bakr first caliph of the rashidun caliphate who entered roman syria and roman mesopotamia under umar the second caliph the muslims decisively conquered syria and mesopotamia as well as roman palestine roman egypt and parts of asia minor and roman north africa this trend continued under umar s successors and under the umayyad caliphate which conquered the rest of mediterranean north africa and most of the iberian peninsula over the next centuries muslim forces were able to take further european territory including cyprus malta crete and sicily and parts of southern italy 52 in the east volga bulgaria became an islamic state in the tenth century 53 the muslim conquest of hispania began when the moors mostly berbers with some arabs invaded the christian visigothic kingdom of iberia in the year 711 under their berber leader tariq ibn ziyad they landed at gibraltar on 30 april and worked their way northward tariq s forces were joined the next year by those of his superior musa ibn nusair during the eight year campaign most of the iberian peninsula was brought under muslim rule save for small areas in the northwest asturias and largely basque regions in the pyrenees this territory under the arab name al andalus became part of the expanding umayyad empire the unsuccessful second siege of constantinople 717 weakened the umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige after their success in overrunning iberia the conquerors moved northeast across the pyrenees but were defeated by the frankish leader charles martel at the battle of poitiers in 732 the umayyads were overthrown in 750 by the abb sids and most of the umayyad clan massacred a surviving umayyad prince abd ar rahman i escaped to spain and founded a new umayyad dynasty in the emirate of cordoba 756 charles martel s son pippin the short retook narbonne and his grandson charlemagne established the marca hispanica across the pyrenees in part of what today is catalonia reconquering girona in 785 and barcelona in 801 the umayyads in spain proclaimed themselves caliphs in 929 during the dark ages the western roman empire fell under the control of various tribes the germanic and slav tribes established their domains over western and eastern europe respectively 54 eventually the frankish tribes were united under clovis 160 i 55 charlemagne a frankish king of the carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of western europe was anointed holy roman emperor by the pope in 800 this led to the founding of the holy roman empire which eventually became centred in the german principalities of central europe 56 the predominantly greek speaking eastern roman empire became known in the west as the byzantine empire its capital was constantinople emperor justinian i presided over constantinople s first golden age he established a legal code funded the construction of the hagia sophia and brought the christian church under state control 57 fatally weakened by the sack of constantinople during the fourth crusade 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 the byzantines fell in 1453 when they were

mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure the nobility and the clergy feudalism developed in france in the early middle ages and soon spread throughout europe 70 a struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in england led to the writing of the magna carta and the establishment of a parliament 71 the primary source of culture in this period came from the roman catholic church through monasteries and cathedral schools the church was responsible for education in much of europe 70 the papacy reached the height of its power during the high middle ages a east west schism in 1054 split the former roman empire religiously with the eastern orthodox church in the byzantine empire and the roman catholic church in the former western roman empire in 1095 pope urban ii called for a crusade against muslims occupying jerusalem and the holy land 72 in europe itself the church organised the inquisition against heretics in spain the reconquista concluded with the fall of granada in 1492 ending over seven centuries of islamic rule in the iberian peninsula 73 the sacking of suzdal by batu khan in 1238 during the mongol invasion of europe in the 11th and 12th centuries constant incursions by nomadic turkic tribes such as the pechenegs and the cuman kipchaks caused a massive migration of slavic populations to the safer heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the rus state to the south and east 74 like many other parts of eurasia these territories were overrun by the mongols 75 the invaders who became known as tatars were mostly turkic under mongol command they established the state of the golden horde which later adopted islam as a religion and ruled over modern day southern and central russia for more than three centuries 76 77 the great famine of 1315 1317 was the first crisis that would strike europe in the late middle ages 78 the period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the

population at the time 83 the plague had a devastating effect on europe s social structure it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by giovanni boccaccio in the decameron 1353 it was a serious blow to the roman catholic church and led to increased persecution of jews foreigners beggars and lepers 84 the plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and

raphael michelangelo and leonardo da vinci 93 94 political intrigue within the church in the mid 14th century caused the great schism during this forty year period two popes one in avignon and one in rome claimed rulership over the church although the schism was eventually healed in 1417 the papacy s spiritual authority had suffered greatly 95 the church s power was further weakened by the protestant reformation 1517 1648 initially sparked by the works of german theologian martin luther a result of the lack of reform within the church the reformation also damaged the holy roman empire s power as german princes became divided between protestant and roman catholic faiths 96 this eventually led to the thirty years war 1618 1648 which crippled the holy roman empire and devastated much of

the napoleonic wars grew to encompass large parts of europe before collapsing in 1815 with the battle of waterloo 111 112 napoleonic rule resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the french revolution including that of the nation state as well as the widespread adoption of the french models of administration law and education 113 114 115 the congress of vienna convened after napoleon s downfall established a new balance of power in europe centred on the five great powers the united kingdom france prussia habsburg austria and russia 116 the industrial revolution started in

steppe europe lies mainly in the temperate climate zones being subjected to prevailing westerlies the climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the gulf stream 149 the gulf stream is nicknamed europe s central heating because it makes europe s climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be the gulf stream not only carries warm water to europe s coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the atlantic ocean therefore the average temperature throughout the year of naples is 16 160 c 60 8 160 f while it is only 12 160 c 53 6 160 f in new york city which is almost on the same latitude berlin germany calgary canada and irkutsk in the asian part of russia lie on around the

main article geology of europe the geology of europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent from the scottish highlands to the rolling plains of hungary 150 europe s most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous southern europe and a vast partially underwater northern plain ranging from ireland in the west to the ural mountains in the east these two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the pyrenees and alps carpathians the northern plains are delimited in the west by the scandinavian mountains and the mountainous parts of the british isles major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the celtic sea the north sea the baltic sea complex and barents sea the northern plain contains the old geological continent of baltica and so may be regarded geologically as the main continent while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents most of the older geology of western europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent avalonia geological history main article geological history of europe the geological history of europe traces back to the formation of the baltic shield fennoscandia and the sarmatian craton both around 2 25 160 billion years ago followed by the volgo uralia shield the three together leading to the east european craton baltica which became a part of the supercontinent columbia around 1 1 160 billion years ago baltica and arctica as part of the laurentia block became joined to rodinia later resplitting around 550 160 million years ago to reform as baltica around 440 160 million years ago euramerica was formed from baltica and laurentia a further joining with gondwana then leading to the formation of pangea around 190 160 million years ago gondwana and laurasia split apart due to the widening of the atlantic ocean finally and very soon afterwards laurasia itself split up again into laurentia north america and the eurasian continent the land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time via greenland leading to interchange of animal species from around 50 160 million years ago rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of europe and its connections with continents such as asia europe s present shape dates to the late tertiary period about five million years ago 151 biodiversity see also fauna of europe biogeographic regions of europe and bordering regions having lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia europe s animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man with the exception of fennoscandia and northern russia few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in europe except for various national parks the main natural vegetation cover in europe is mixed forest the conditions for growth are very favourable in the north the gulf stream and north atlantic drift warm the continent southern europe could be described as having a warm but mild climate there are frequent summer droughts in this region mountain ridges also affect the conditions some of these alps pyrenees are oriented east west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior others are oriented south north scandinavian mountains dinarides carpathians apennines and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea forests grow well on this side while on the other side the conditions are much less favourable few corners of mainland europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time and the cutting down of the pre agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems probably 80 to 90 per cent of europe was once covered by forest 152 it stretched from the mediterranean sea to the arctic ocean though over half of europe s original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest such as the taiga of scandinavia and russia mixed rainforests of the caucasus and the cork oak forests in the western mediterranean during recent times deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted however in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest because these grow quicker the plantations now cover vast areas of land but offer poorer habitats for many european forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure the amount of natural forest in western europe is just 2 3 or less in european russia 5 10 the country with the smallest percentage of forested area is iceland 1 while the most forested country is finland 77 153 floristic regions of europe and neighbouring areas according to wolfgang frey and rainer l sch in temperate europe mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate the most important species in central and western europe are beech and oak in the north the taiga is a mixed spruce pine birch forest further north within russia and extreme northern scandinavia the taiga gives way to tundra as the arctic is approached in the mediterranean many olive trees have been planted which are very well adapted to its arid climate mediterranean cypress is also widely planted in southern europe the semi arid mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest a narrow east west tongue of eurasian grassland the steppe extends eastwards from ukraine and southern russia and ends in hungary and traverses into taiga to the north glaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of man affected the distribution of european fauna as for the animals in many parts of europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction the woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the neolithic period today wolves carnivores and bears omnivores are endangered once they were found in most parts of europe however deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further by the middle ages the bears habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover today the brown bear lives primarily in the balkan peninsula scandinavia and russia a small number also persist in other countries across europe austria pyrenees etc but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat in addition polar bears may be found on svalbard a norwegian archipelago far north of scandinavia the wolf the second largest predator in europe after the brown bear can be found primarily in eastern europe and in the balkans with a handful of packs in pockets of western europe scandinavia spain etc once roaming the great temperate forests of eurasia european bison now live in nature preserves in bialowieza forest on the border between poland and belarus 154 155 european wild cat foxes especially the red fox jackal and different species of martens hedgehogs different species of reptiles like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes and amphibians different birds owls hawks and other birds of prey important european herbivores are snails larvae fish different birds and mammals like rodents deer and roe deer boars and living in the mountains marmots steinbocks chamois among others the extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the mediterranean sea creatures are also an important part of european flora and fauna the sea flora is mainly phytoplankton important animals that live in european seas are zooplankton molluscs echinoderms different crustaceans squids and octopuses fish dolphins and whales biodiversity is protected in europe through the council of

economies were disrupted by world war i but by the beginning of world war ii they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the united states world war ii again damaged much of europe s industries 1945 1990 the cold war after world war ii the economy of the uk was in a state of ruin 166 and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades 167 italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s west germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from pre war levels by the 1950s 168 france also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation later on spain under the leadership of franco also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth

europe germanic languages are spoken in northern europe the british isles and some parts of central europe slavic languages are spoken in central eastern and southeastern europe 151 many other languages outside the three main groups exist in europe other indo european languages include the baltic group that is latvian and lithuanian the celtic group that is irish scottish gaelic manx welsh
