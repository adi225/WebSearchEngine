priestesses in a temple of prophecy in classical antiquity an oracle was a person or agency considered to be a source of wise counsel or prophetic predictions or precognition of the future inspired by the gods as such it is a form of divination the word oracle comes from the latin verb r re to speak and properly refers to the priest or priestess uttering the prediction in extended use oracle may also refer to the site of the oracle and to the oracular utterances themselves called khr smoi in greek oracles were thought to be portals through which the gods spoke directly to people in this sense they were different from seers manteis who interpreted signs sent by the gods through bird signs animal entrails and other various methods 1 the most important oracles of greek antiquity were pythia priestess to apollo at delphi and the oracle of dione and zeus at dodona in epirus other temples of apollo were located at didyma on the coast of asia minor at corinth and bassae in the peloponnese and at the islands of delos and aegina in the aegean sea only the delphic oracle was a male all others were female 2 the sibylline oracles are a collection of oracular utterances written in greek

burkert observes that frenzied women from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the near east as in mari in the second millennium bc and in assyria in the first millennium bc 3 in egypt the goddess wadjet eye of the moon was depicted as a snake headed woman or a woman with two snake heads her oracle was in the renowned temple in per wadjet greek name buto the oracle of wadjet may have been the source for the oracular tradition which spread from egypt to greece 4 evans linked wadjet with the minoan snake goddess a chthonic deity and one of the aspects of the great mother 5 in greece the old oracles were devoted to the mother goddess at the oracle of dodona she will be called di n the feminine form of di s genitive of zeus pie dyaeus or of d os godly literally heavenly who represents the earth fertile soil probably the chief female goddess of the pie pantheon python daughter or son of gaia was the earth dragon of delphi represented as a serpent and became the chthonic deity enemy of apollo who slew her and possessed the oracle 6 edit pythia pythia the oracle at delphi only gave prophecies the seventh day of each month seven being the number most associated with apollo during the nine warmer months of the year thus delphi was not the major source of divination for the ancient greeks many wealthy individuals bypassed the hordes of people attempting a consultation by making additional animal sacrifices to please the oracle lest their request go unanswered as a result seers were the main source of everyday divination the temple was changed to a center for the worship of apollo during the classical period of greece and priests were added to the temple organization although the tradition regarding prophecy remained unchanged and the apparently always female priestess continued to provide the services of the oracle exclusively it is from this institution that the english word oracle is derived the delphic oracle exerted considerable influence throughout hellenic culture distinctively this female was essentially the highest authority both civilly and religiously in male dominated ancient greece she responded to the questions of citizens foreigners kings and philosophers on issues of political impact war duty crime laws even personal issues 7 nevertheless there was a catch the pythia when about to deliver would chew leaves from apollo s sacred laurel tree and would then sit on her holy tripod seated in the innermost sanctum over a crack on the rock from where noxious volcanic fumes emanated dazed and disoriented she would then be possessed by the voice of apollo and utter inarticulate sounds before fainting only the priests were present there and they had the task of translating her utterances in plain speech the priests were extremely well versed on the various matters of state as part of their work was to debrief pilgrims about all that they knew in addition no question to the god was ever dealt with immediately after the query was submitted several days of prescribed ceremonial had to be observed before apollo was so satisfied as to speak through his priestess which gave the priests precious time for research the semi hellenic countries around the greek world such as lydia caria and even egypt also respected her and came to delphi as supplicants croesus king of lydia beginning in 560 b c tested the oracles of the world to discover which gave the most accurate prophecies he sent out emissaries to seven sites who were all to ask the oracles on the same day what the king was doing at that very moment croesus proclaimed the oracle at delphi to be the most accurate who correctly reported that the king was making a lamb and tortoise stew and so he graced her with a magnitude of precious gifts 8 he then consulted delphi before attacking persia and according to herodotus was advised if you cross the river a great empire will be destroyed believing the response favorable croesus attacked but it was his own empire that ultimately was destroyed by the persians she allegedly also proclaimed socrates to be the wisest man in greece to which socrates said that if so this was because he alone was aware of his own ignorance after this confrontation socrates dedicated his life to a search for knowledge that was one of the founding events of western philosophy he claimed that she was an essential guide to personal and state development 9 this oracle s last recorded response was given in 393 ad when the emperor theodosius i ordered pagan temples to cease operation citation needed the oracle s powers were highly sought after and never doubted any inconsistencies between prophecies and events were dismissed as failure to correctly interpret the responses not an error of the oracle 10 very often prophecies were worded ambiguously so as to cover all contingencies especially so ex post facto one famous such response to a query about participation in a military campaign was you will go you will return never in war will you perish this gives the recipient liberty to place a comma before or after the word never thus covering both possible outcomes another was the response to the athenians when the vast army of king xerxes i was approaching athens with the intent of razing the city to the ground only the wooden palisades may save you citation needed answered the oracle probably aware that there was sentiment for sailing to the safety of southern italy and reestablishing athens there some thought that it was a recommendation to fortify the acropolis with a wooden fence and make a stand there others themistocles among them said the oracle was clearly for fighting at sea the metaphor intended to mean war ships others still insisted that their case was so hopeless that they should board every ship available and flee to italy where they would be safe beyond any doubt in the event variations of all three interpretations were attempted some barricaded the acropolis the civilian population was evacuated over sea to nearby salamis island and to troizen and the war fleet fought victoriously at salamis bay should utter destruction have happened it could always be claimed that the oracle had called for fleeing to italy after all edit dodona dodona was another oracle devoted to the mother goddess identified at other sites with rhea or gaia but here called dione the shrine of dodona was the oldest hellenic oracle according to the fifth century historian herodotus and in fact dates to pre hellenic times perhaps as early as the second millennium bc when the tradition probably spread from egypt zeus displaced the mother goddess and assimilated her as aphrodite it became the second most important oracle in ancient greece which later was dedicated to zeus and to heracles during the classical period of greece at dodona zeus was worshipped as zeus naios or naos god of springs naiads from a spring which existed under the oak and zeus bouleos cancellor priestesses and priests interpreted the rustling of the oak leaves to determine the correct actions to be taken the oracle was shared by dione and zeus edit trophonius trophonius was an oracle at lebadea of boeotia devoted to the chthonian zeus trophonius trophonius is derived from the greek word trepho nourish and he was a greek hero or demon or god demeter europa was his nurse 11 europa in greek broad eyes was a phoenecian princess who zeus transformed into a white bull abducted and carried her to creta and is equated with astarte as a moon goddess by ancient sources 12
