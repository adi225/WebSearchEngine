science science policy scientific method fringe science pseudoscience technoscience science portal category v t e cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes it examines what cognition is what it does and how it works it includes research on intelligence and behavior especially focusing on how information is represented processed and transformed in faculties such as perception language memory reasoning and emotion within nervous systems human or other animal and machines e g computers cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines including psychology artificial intelligence philosophy neuroscience linguistics and anthropology 1 it spans many levels of analysis from low level learning and decision mechanisms to high level logic and planning from neural circuitry to modular brain organization the fundamental concept of cognitive science is that thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures 1 contents 1 principles 1 1 levels of analysis 1 2 interdisciplinary nature 1 3 cognitive science the term 2 scope

central tenet of cognitive science is that a complete understanding of the mind brain cannot be attained by studying only a single level an example would be the problem of remembering a phone number and recalling it later one approach to understanding this process would be to study behavior through direct observation a person could be presented with a phone number asked to recall it after some delay then the accuracy of the response could be measured another approach would be to study the firings of individual neurons while a person is trying to remember the phone number neither of these experiments on its own would fully explain how the process of remembering a phone number works even if the technology to map out every neuron in the brain in real time were available and it were known when each neuron was firing it would still be impossible to know how a particular firing of neurons translates into the observed behavior thus an understanding of how these two levels relate to each other is needed the embodied mind cognitive science and human experience says the new sciences of the mind need to enlarge their horizon to encompass both lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent in human experience 2 this can be provided by a functional level account of the process studying a particular phenomenon from multiple levels creates a better understanding of the processes that occur in the brain to give rise to a particular behavior marr 3 gave a famous description of three levels of analysis the computational theory specifying the goals of the computation representation and algorithm giving a representation of the input and output and the algorithm which transforms one into the other and the hardware implementation how algorithm and representation may be physically realized see also the entry on functionalism edit interdisciplinary nature cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field with contributors from various fields including psychology neuroscience linguistics philosophy of mind computer science anthropology sociology and biology cognitive science tends to view the world outside the mind much as other sciences do thus it too has an objective observer independent existence the field is usually seen as compatible with the physical sciences and uses the scientific method as well as simulation or modeling often comparing the output of models with aspects of human behavior some doubt whether there is a unified cognitive science and prefer to speak of the cognitive sciences in plural 4 many but not all who consider themselves cognitive scientists have a functionalist view of the mind the view that mental states are classified functionally such that any system that performs the proper function for some mental state is considered to be in that mental state according to some versions of functionalism even non human systems such as other animal species alien life forms or advanced computers can in principle have mental states edit cognitive science the term the term cognitive in cognitive science is used for any kind of mental operation or structure that can be studied in precise terms lakoff and johnson 1999 this conceptualization is very broad and should not be confused with how cognitive is used in some traditions of analytic philosophy where cognitive has to do only with formal rules and truth conditional semantics the earliest entries for the word cognitive in the oed take it to mean roughly pertaining to the action or process of knowing the first entry from 1586 shows the word was at one time used in the context of discussions of platonic theories of knowledge most in cognitive science however presumably do not believe their field is the study of anything as certain as the knowledge sought by plato citation needed edit scope cognitive science is a large field and covers a wide array of topics on cognition however it should be recognized that cognitive science is not equally concerned with every topic that might bear on the nature and operation of the mind or intelligence social and cultural factors emotion consciousness animal cognition comparative and evolutionary approaches are frequently de emphasized or excluded outright often based on key philosophical conflicts another important mind related subject that the cognitive sciences tend to avoid is the existence of qualia with discussions over this issue being sometimes limited to only mentioning qualia as a philosophically open matter some within the cognitive science community however consider these to be vital topics and advocate the importance of investigating them 5 below are some of the main topics that cognitive science is concerned with this is not an exhaustive list but is meant to cover the wide range of intelligent behaviors see list of cognitive science topics for a list of various aspects of the field edit artificial intelligence main article artificial intelligence one major contribution of ai and cognitive science to psychology has been the information processing model of human thinking in which the metaphor of brain as computer is taken quite literally aaai web pages artificial intelligence ai involves the study of cognitive phenomena in machines one of the practical goals of ai is to implement aspects of human intelligence in computers computers are also widely used as a tool with which to study cognitive phenomena computational modeling uses simulations to study how human intelligence may be structured 6 see the section on computational modeling in the research methods section there is some debate in the field as to whether the mind is best viewed as a huge array of small but individually feeble elements i e neurons or as a collection of higher level structures such as symbols schemas plans and rules the former view uses connectionism to study the mind whereas the latter emphasizes symbolic computations one way to view the issue is whether it is possible to accurately simulate a human brain on a computer without accurately simulating the neurons that make up the human brain edit attention main article attention attention is the selection of important information the human mind is bombarded with millions of stimuli and it must have a way of deciding which of this information to process attention is sometimes seen as a spotlight meaning one can only shine the light on a particular set of information experiments that support this metaphor include the dichotic listening task cherry 1957 and studies of inattentional blindness mack and rock 1998 in the dichotic listening task subjects are bombarded with two different messages one in each ear and told to focus on only one of the messages at the end of the experiment when asked about the content of the unattended message subjects cannot report it edit knowledge and processing of language a well known example of a phrase structure tree this is one way of representing human language that shows how different components are organized hierarchically main articles theoretical linguistics cognitive linguistics language linguistics and psycholinguistics the ability to learn and understand language is an extremely complex process language is acquired within the first few years of life and all humans under normal circumstances are able to acquire language proficiently a major driving force in the theoretical linguistic field is discovering the nature that language must have in the abstract in order to be learned in such a fashion some of the driving research questions in studying how the brain itself processes language include 1 to what extent is linguistic knowledge innate or learned 2 why is it more difficult for adults to acquire a second language than it is for infants to acquire their first language and 3 how are humans able to understand novel sentences the study of language processing ranges from the investigation of the sound patterns of speech to the meaning of words and whole sentences linguistics often divides language processing into orthography phonology and phonetics morphology syntax semantics and pragmatics many aspects of language can be studied from each of these components and from their interaction the study of language processing in cognitive science is closely tied to the field of linguistics linguistics was traditionally studied as a part of the humanities including studies of history art and literature in the last fifty years or so more and more researchers have studied knowledge and use of language as a cognitive phenomenon the main problems being how knowledge of language can be acquired and used and what precisely it consists of linguists have found that while humans form sentences in ways apparently governed by very complex systems they are remarkably unaware of the rules that govern their own speech thus linguists must resort to indirect methods to determine what those rules might be if indeed rules as such exist in any event if speech is indeed governed by rules they appear to be opaque to any conscious consideration edit learning and development main articles learning and developmental psychology learning and development are the processes by which we acquire knowledge and information over time infants are born with little or no knowledge depending on how knowledge is defined yet they rapidly acquire the ability to use language walk and recognize people and objects research in learning and development aims to explain the mechanisms by which these processes might take place a major question in the study of cognitive development is the extent to which certain abilities are innate or learned this is often framed in terms of the nature versus nurture debate the nativist view emphasizes that certain features are innate to an organism and are determined by its genetic endowment the empiricist view on the other hand emphasizes that certain abilities are learned from the environment although clearly both genetic and environmental input is needed for a child to develop normally considerable debate remains about how genetic information might guide cognitive development in the area of language acquisition for example some such as steven pinker 7 have argued that specific information containing universal grammatical rules must be contained in the genes whereas others such as jeffrey elman and colleagues in rethinking innateness have argued that pinker s claims are biologically unrealistic they argue that genes determine the architecture of a learning system but that specific facts about how grammar works can only be learned as a result of experience edit memory main article memory memory allows us to store information for later retrieval memory is often thought of consisting of both a long term and short term store long term memory allows us to store information over prolonged periods days weeks years we do not yet know the practical limit of long term memory capacity short term memory allows us to store information over short time scales seconds or minutes memory is also often grouped into declarative and procedural forms declarative memory grouped into subsets of semantic and episodic forms of memory refers to our memory for facts and specific knowledge specific meanings and specific experiences e g who was the first president of the u s a or what did i eat for breakfast four days ago procedural memory allows us to remember actions and motor sequences e g how to ride a bicycle and is often dubbed implicit knowledge or memory cognitive scientists study memory just as psychologists do but tend to focus in more on how memory bears on cognitive processes and the interrelationship between cognition and memory one example of this could be what mental processes does a person go through to retrieve a long lost memory or what differentiates between the cognitive process of recognition seeing hints of something before remembering it or memory in context and recall retrieving a memory as in fill in the blank edit perception and action the necker cube an example of an optical illusion an optical illusion the square a is exactly the same shade of gray as square b see checker shadow illusion main article perception perception is the ability to take in information via the senses and process it in some way vision and hearing are two dominant senses that allow us to perceive the environment some questions in the study of visual perception for example include 1 how are we able to recognize objects 2 why do we perceive a continuous visual environment even though we only see small bits of it at any one time one tool for studying visual perception is by looking at how people process optical illusions the image on the right of a necker cube is an example of a bistable percept that is the cube can be interpreted as being oriented in two different directions the study of haptic tactile olfactory and gustatory stimuli also fall into the domain of perception action is taken to refer to the output of a system in humans this is accomplished through motor responses spatial planning and movement speech production and complex motor movements are all aspects of action edit research methods many different methodologies are used to study cognitive science as the field is highly interdisciplinary research often cuts across multiple areas of study drawing on research methods from psychology neuroscience computer science and systems theory edit behavioral experiments in order to have a description of what constitutes intelligent behavior one must study behavior itself this type of research is closely tied to that in cognitive psychology and psychophysics by measuring behavioral responses to different stimuli one can understand something about how those stimuli are processed lewandowski and strohmetz 2009 review a collection of innovative uses of behavioral measurement in psychology including behavioral traces behavioral observations and behavioral choice 8 behavioral traces are pieces of evidence that indicate behavior occurred but the actor is not present e g litter in a parking lot or readings on an electric meter behavioral observations involve the direct witnessing of the actor engaging in the behavior e g watching how close a person sits next to another person behavioral choices are when a person selects between two or more options e g voting behavior choice of a punishment for another participant reaction time the time between the presentation of a stimulus and an appropriate response can indicate differences between two cognitive processes and can indicate some things about their nature for example if in a search task the reaction times vary proportionally with the number of elements then it is evident that this cognitive process of searching involves serial instead of parallel processing psychophysical responses psychophysical experiments are an old psychological technique which has been adopted by cognitive psychology they typically involve making judgments of some physical property e g the loudness of a sound correlation of subjective scales between individuals can show cognitive or sensory biases as compared to actual physical measurements some examples include sameness judgments for colors tones textures etc threshold differences for colors tones textures etc eye tracking this methodology is used to study a variety of cognitive processes most notably visual perception and language processing the fixation point of the eyes is linked to an individual s focus of attention thus by monitoring eye movements we can study what information is being processed at a given time eye tracking allows us to study cognitive processes on extremely short time scales eye movements reflect online decision making during a task and they provide us with some insight into the ways in which those decisions may be processed edit brain imaging main article neuroimaging image of the human head with the brain the arrow indicates the position of the hypothalamus brain imaging involves analyzing activity within the brain while performing various tasks this allows us to link behavior and brain function to help understand how information is processed different types of imaging techniques vary in their temporal time based and spatial location based resolution brain imaging is often used in cognitive neuroscience single photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography spect and pet use radioactive isotopes which are injected into the subject s bloodstream and taken up by the brain by observing which areas of the brain take up the radioactive isotope we can see which areas of the brain are more active than other areas pet has similar spatial resolution to fmri but it has extremely poor temporal resolution electroencephalography eeg measures the electrical fields generated by large populations of neurons in the cortex by placing a series of electrodes on the scalp of the subject this technique has an extremely high temporal resolution but a relatively poor spatial resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri measures the relative amount of oxygenated blood flowing to different parts of the brain more oxygenated blood in a particular region is assumed to correlate with an increase in neural activity in that part of the brain this allows us to localize particular functions within different brain regions fmri has moderate spatial and temporal resolution optical imaging this technique uses infrared transmitters and receivers to measure the amount of light reflectance by blood near different areas of the brain since oxygenated and deoxygenated blood reflects light by different amounts we can study which areas are more active i e those that have more oxygenated blood optical imaging has moderate temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution it also has the advantage that it is extremely safe and can be used to study infants brains magnetoencephalography meg measures magnetic fields resulting from cortical activity it is similar to eeg except that it has improved spatial resolution since the magnetic fields it measures are not as blurred or attenuated by the scalp meninges and so forth as the electrical activity measured in eeg is meg uses squid sensors to detect tiny magnetic fields edit computational modeling a neural network with two layers computational models require a mathematically and logically formal representation of a problem computer models are used in the simulation and experimental verification of different specific and general properties of intelligence computational modeling can help us to understand the functional organization of a particular cognitive phenomenon there are two basic approaches to cognitive modeling the first is focused on abstract mental functions of an intelligent mind and operates using symbols and the second which follows the neural and associative properties of the human brain is called subsymbolic symbolic modeling evolved from the computer science paradigms using the technologies of knowledge based systems as well as a philosophical perspective see for example good old fashioned artificial intelligence gofai they are developed by the first cognitive researchers and later used in information engineering for expert systems since the early 1990s it was generalized in systemics for the investigation of functional human like intelligence models such as personoids and in parallel developed as the soar environment recently especially in the context of cognitive decision making symbolic cognitive modeling is extended to socio cognitive approach including social and organization cognition interrelated with a sub symbolic not conscious layer subsymbolic modeling includes connectionist neural network models connectionism relies on the idea that the mind brain is composed of simple nodes and that the power of the system comes primarily from the existence and manner of connections between the simple nodes neural nets are textbook implementations of this approach some critics of this approach feel that while these models approach biological reality as a representation of how the system works they lack explanatory powers because complicated systems of connections with even simple rules are extremely complex and often less interpretable than the system they model other approaches gaining in popularity include the use of dynamical systems theory and also techniques putting symbolic models and connectionist models into correspondence neural symbolic integration bayesian models often drawn from machine learning are also gaining popularity all the above approaches tend to be generalized to the form of integrated computational models of a synthetic abstract intelligence in order to be applied to the explanation and improvement of individual and social organizational decision making and reasoning edit neurobiological methods research methods borrowed directly from neuroscience and neuropsychology can also help us to understand aspects of intelligence these methods allow us to understand how intelligent behavior is implemented in a physical system single unit recording direct brain stimulation animal models postmortem studies edit key findings cognitive science has much to its credit among other accomplishments it has given rise to models of human cognitive bias and risk perception and has been influential in the development of behavioral finance part of economics it has also given rise to a new theory of the philosophy of mathematics and many theories of artificial intelligence persuasion and coercion it has made its presence firmly known in the philosophy of language and epistemology a modern revival of rationalism as well as constituting a substantial wing of modern linguistics fields of cognitive science have been influential in understanding the brain s particular functional systems and functional deficits ranging from speech production to auditory processing and visual perception it has made progress in understanding how damage to particular areas of the brain affect cognition and it has helped to uncover the root causes and results of specific dysfunction such as dyslexia anopia and hemispatial neglect edit history cognitive science has a pre history traceable back to ancient greek philosophical texts see plato s meno and certainly must include writers such as descartes david hume immanuel kant benedict de spinoza nicolas malebranche pierre cabanis leibniz and john locke however although these early writers contributed greatly to the philosophical discovery of mind and this would ultimately lead to the development of psychology they were working with an entirely different set of tools and core concepts than those of the cognitive scientist the modern culture of cognitive science can be traced back to the early cyberneticists in the 1930s and 1940s such as warren mcculloch and walter pitts who sought to understand the organizing principles of the mind mcculloch and pitts developed the first variants of what are now known as artificial neural networks models of computation inspired by the structure of biological neural networks another precursor was the early development of the theory of computation and the digital computer in the 1940s and 1950s alan turing and john von neumann were instrumental in these developments the modern computer or von neumann machine would play a central role in cognitive science both as a metaphor for the mind and as a tool for investigation in 1959 noam chomsky published a scathing review of b f skinner s book verbal behavior at the time skinner s behaviorist paradigm dominated psychology most psychologists focused on functional relations between stimulus and response without positing internal representations chomsky argued that in order to explain language we needed a theory like generative grammar which not only attributed internal representations but characterized their underlying order the term cognitive science was coined by christopher longuet higgins in his 1973 commentary on the lighthill report which concerned the then current state of artificial intelligence research 9 in the same decade the journal cognitive science and the cognitive science society were founded 10 in 1982 vassar college became the first institution in the world to grant an undergraduate degree in cognitive science 11 in the 1970s and early 1980s much cognitive science research focused on the possibility of artificial intelligence researchers such as marvin minsky would write computer programs in languages such as lisp to attempt to formally characterize the steps that human beings went through for instance in making decisions and solving problems in the hope of better understanding human thought and also in the hope of creating artificial minds this approach is known as symbolic ai eventually the limits of the symbolic ai research program became apparent for instance it seemed to be unrealistic to comprehensively list human knowledge in a form usable by a symbolic computer program the late 80s and 90s saw the rise of neural networks and connectionism as a research paradigm under this point of view often attributed to james mcclelland and david rumelhart the mind could be characterized as a set of complex associations represented as a layered network critics argue that there are some phenomena which are better captured by symbolic models and that connectionist models are often so complex as to have little explanatory power recently symbolic and connectionist models have been combined making it possible to take advantage of both forms of explanation 12 edit notable researchers this section needs additional citations for verification please
