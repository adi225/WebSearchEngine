sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test also known in statistics as classification function sensitivity also called recall rate in some fields measures the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as such e g the percentage of sick people who are correctly identified as having the condition specificity measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified e g the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the condition these two measures are closely related to the concepts of type i and type ii errors a perfect predictor would be described as 100 sensitive i e predicting all people from the sick group as sick and 100 specific i e not predicting anyone from the healthy group as sick however theoretically any predictor will possess a minimum error bound known as the bayes error rate for any test there is usually a trade off between the measures for example in an airport security setting in which one is testing for potential threats to safety scanners may be set to trigger on low risk items like belt buckles and keys low specificity in order to reduce the risk of missing objects that do pose a threat to the aircraft and those aboard high sensitivity this trade off can be represented graphically as a receiver operating characteristic curve contents 1

does not have the disease the test outcome can be positive predicting that the person has the disease or negative predicting that the person does not have the disease the test results for each subject may or may not match the subject s actual status in that setting true positive sick people correctly diagnosed as sick false positive healthy people incorrectly identified as sick true negative healthy people correctly identified as healthy false negative sick people incorrectly identified as healthy in general positive identified and negative rejected therefore true positive correctly identified false positive incorrectly identified true negative correctly rejected false negative incorrectly rejected edit sensitivity sensitivity relates to the test s ability to identify positive results the sensitivity of a test is the proportion of people that are known to have the disease who test positive for it this can also be written as again consider the example of the medical test used to identify a disease a bogus test kit that always indicates positive regardless of the disease status of the patient will achieve from a theoretical point of view 100 sensitivity this is because in this case there are no negatives at all and false positives are not accounted for in the definition of sensitivity therefore sensitivity alone cannot be used to determine whether a test is useful in practice however a test with high sensitivity can be considered as a reliable indicator when its result is negative since it rarely misses true positives among those who are actually positive for example a sensitivity of 100 means that the test recognizes all actual positives i e all sick people are recognized as being ill thus in contrast to a high specificity test negative results in a high sensitivity test are used to rule out the disease 1 sensitivity is not the same as the precision or positive predictive value ratio of true positives to combined true and false positives which is as much a statement about the proportion of actual positives in the population being tested as it is about the test the calculation of sensitivity does not take into account indeterminate test results if a test cannot be repeated indeterminate samples either should be excluded from the analysis the number of exclusions should be stated when quoting sensitivity or can be treated as false negatives which gives the worst case value for sensitivity and may therefore underestimate it a test with a high sensitivity has a low type ii error rate in non medical contexts sensitivity is sometimes called recall edit specificity specificity relates to the test s ability to identify negative results consider the example of the medical test used to identify a disease the specificity of a test is defined as the proportion of patients that are known not to have the disease who will test negative for it this can also be written as from a theoretical point of view a bogus test kit which always indicates negative regardless of the disease status of the patient will achieve 100 specificity since there are no positive results and false negatives are not accounted for by definition however highly specific tests rarely miss negative outcomes so they can be considered reliable when their result is positive therefore a positive result from a test with high specificity means a high probability of the presence of disease 1 a test with a high specificity has a low type i error rate edit graphical illustration high sensitivity and low specificity low sensitivity and high specificity edit medical examples in medical diagnostics test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease true positive rate whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease true negative rate 2 if 100 patients known to have a disease were tested and 43 test positive then the test has 43 sensitivity if 100 with no disease are tested and 96 return a negative result then the test has 96 specificity sensitivity and specificity are prevalence independent test characteristics as their values are intrinsic to the test and do not depend on the disease prevalence in the population of interest 3 a highly specific test is unlikely to give a false positive result a positive result should thus be regarded as a true positive a sign or symptom with very high specificity is often termed pathognomonic an example of such a test is the inspection for erythema chronicum migrans to diagnose lyme disease 4 in contrast a sensitive test rarely misses a condition so a negative result should be reassuring the disease tested for is absent a sign or symptom with very high sensitivity is often termed sine qua non an example of such test is a genetic test to find an underlying mutation in certain types of hereditary colon cancer 5 6 spin and snout are commonly used mnemonics which says a highly specific test when positive rules in disease sp p in and a highly sensitive test when negative rules out disease sn n out edit worked example view talk edit relationships among terms condition as determined by gold standard condition

fob screen test is in itself poor at confirming cancer ppv 160 160 10 and further investigations must be undertaken it did however correctly identify 66 7 of all cancers the sensitivity however as a screening test a negative result is very good at reassuring that a patient does not have cancer npv 160 160 99 5 and at this initial screen correctly identifies 91 of those who do not have cancer the specificity edit estimation of errors in quoted sensitivity or specificity sensitivity and specificity values alone may be highly misleading the worst case sensitivity or specificity must be calculated in order to avoid reliance on experiments with few results for example a particular test may easily show 100 sensitivity if tested against the gold standard four times but a single additional test against the gold standard that gave a poor result would imply a sensitivity of only 80 a common way to do this is to state the binomial proportion confidence interval often calculated using a wilson score interval edit terminology in information retrieval in information retrieval positive predictive value is called precision and sensitivity is called recall the f score can be used as a single measure of performance of the test the f score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall in the traditional language of statistical hypothesis testing the sensitivity of a test is called the statistical power of the test although the word power in that context has a more general usage that is not applicable in the present context a sensitive test will have fewer type ii errors
