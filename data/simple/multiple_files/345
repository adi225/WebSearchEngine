business category or the name of a consumer product but also where information such as a street address city name postal code or geographic coordinates like latitude and longitude examples of local

advertising typically distributed by newspaper publishers and tv and radio broadcasters to the web historically consumers relied on local newspapers and local tv and radio stations to find local product and services with the advent of the web consumers are increasingly using search engines to find these local products and services online in recent years the number of local searches online has grown rapidly while off line information searches such as print yellow page lookups have declined as a natural consequence of this shift in consumer behavior local product and service providers are slowly shifting their advertising investments from traditional off line media to local search engines a variety of search engines are currently providing local search including efforts backed by the largest search engines and new start ups some of these efforts are further targeted to specific vertical segments while others are tied to mapping products various geolocation techniques may be used to match visitors queries with information of interest the sources and types of information and points of interest returned varies with the type of local search engine google maps formerly google local looks for physical addresses mentioned in regular web pages it provides these results to visitors along with business listings and maps product specific search engines use techniques such as targeted web crawling and direct feeds to collect information about products for sale in a specific geographic area other local search engines adjunct to major web search portals include general windows live local yahoo local and ask com s askcity yahoo for example separates its local search engine features into yahoo local and yahoo maps the former being focused on business data and correlating it with web data the latter focused primarily on the map features e g directions larger map navigation search engines offer local businesses the possibility to upload their business data to their respective local search databases local search like ordinary search can be applied in two ways as john battelle coined it in his book the search search can be either recovery search or discovery search this perfect search also has perfect recall it knows what you ve seen and can discern between a journey of discovery where you want to find something new and recovery where you want to find something you ve seen before citation needed this applies especially to local search recovery search implies for example that a consumer knows who she is looking for i e main street pizza parlor but she does not know where they are or needs their phone number discovery search implies that the searcher knows for example what she wants but not who she needs it from i e pizza on main street in springfield in february 2012 google announced that they made 40 changes to their search algorithm including one codenamed venice which google states will improve local search results by relying more on the ranking of google s main search results as a signal 1 meaning local search will now rely more on organic serps search engine result pages edit private label local search traditional local media companies including newspaper publishers and television and radio broadcasters are starting to add local search to their local websites in an effort to attract their share of local search traffic and advertising revenues in the markets they serve these local media companies either develop their own technology or license private label or white label local search solutions from third party local search solution providers in either case local media companies base their solution on business listings databases developed in house or licensed from a third party data publisher most regions around print directory publishers also have an online presence citation needed edit social local search local search that incorporates internal or external social signals could be considered social local search driven the first site to incorporate this type of search was explore to yellow pages explore to uses facebook likes as one of the signals to increase the ranking of listings where other factors may be equal or almost equal typical ranking signals in local search such as keyword relevancy and distance from centroid can therefore be layered with these social signals to give a better crowdsourced experience for users edit mobile local search several providers have been experimenting with providing local search for mobile devices some of these are location aware in the united states google previously operated an experimental voice based locative service 1 800 goog 411 but terminated the service in november 2010 many mobile web portals require the subscriber to download a small java application however the recently added mobi top level domain has given impetus to the development of mobile targeted search sites are based upon a standard mobile specific xml protocol that all modern mobile browsers understand the advantage is that no software needs to be downloaded and installed plus these sites may be designed to simultaneously provide conventional content to traditional pc users by means of automatic browser detection edit business owners and local search electronic publishers such as businesses or individuals who would like information such as their name address phone number website business description and business hours to appear on local search engines have several options the most reliable way to include accurate local business information is to claim business listings through google s yahoo s or bings s respective local business centers it is ever so more important today that small business owners claim their free local listing with google places since google places is often one of the first listings seen on google s search result page whenever their algorithm deems a keyword query to have local intent example of google places listings in organic search from google s search engine based on the user s ip address in toronto business listing information can also be distributed via the traditional yellow pages electronic yellow pages aggregators and search engine optimization services some search engines will pick up on web pages that contain regular street addresses displayed in machine readable text rather than a picture of text which is more difficult to interpret web pages can also use geotagging techniques edit google local on may 30 2012 google launched google local a simple way
