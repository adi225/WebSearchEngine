proved successful 4 and managed productions at the prince of wales theatre before writing dracula stoker met rmin v mb ry who was a hungarian writer and traveler dracula likely emerged from v mb ry s dark stories of the carpathian mountains 8 stoker then spent several years researching european folklore and mythological stories of vampires dracula is an epistolary novel written as a collection of realistic but completely fictional diary entries telegrams letters ship s logs and newspaper clippings all of which added a level of detailed realism to his story a skill he developed as a newspaper writer at the time of its publication dracula was considered a straightforward horror novel based on imaginary creations of supernatural life 7 it gave form to a universal fantasy and became a part of popular culture 7 according to the encyclopedia of world biography stoker s stories are today included within the categories of horror fiction romanticized gothic stories and melodrama 7 they are classified alongside other works of popular fiction such as mary shelley s frankenstein 9 394 which according to historian jules zanger also used the myth making and story telling method of having multiple narrators telling the same tale from different perspectives they can t all be lying thinks the reader 10 the original 541 page manuscript of dracula believed to have been lost was found in a barn in northwestern pennsylvania during the early 1980s 11 it included the typed manuscript with many corrections and handwritten on the title page was the un dead the author s name was shown at the bottom as bram stoker author robert latham notes the most famous horror novel ever published its title changed at the last minute 9 the manuscript was purchased by microsoft co founder paul allen stoker s inspirations for the story in addition to whitby may have included a visit to slains castle in aberdeenshire a visit to the crypts of st michan s church in dublin and the novella carmilla by joseph sheridan le fanu 12 stoker s original research notes for the novel are kept by the rosenbach museum and library in philadelphia pa a facsimile edition of the notes was created by elizabeth miller and robert eighteen bisang in 1998 edit death in golders green after suffering a number of strokes stoker died at no 26 st george s square on 20 april 1912 13 some biographers attribute the cause of death to tertiary syphilis 14 others to overwork 15 he was cremated and his ashes placed in a display urn at golders green crematorium after irving noel stoker s death in 1961 his ashes were added to that urn the original plan had been to keep his parents ashes together but after florence stoker s death her ashes were scattered at the gardens of rest to visit his remains at golders green visitors must be escorted to the room the urn is housed in for fear of vandalism edit beliefs and philosophy stoker was brought up as a protestant in the church of ireland he was a strong supporter of the liberal party he took a keen interest in irish affairs 4 and was what he called a philosophical home ruler believing in home rule for ireland brought about by peaceful means but as an ardent monarchist he believed that ireland should remain within the british empire which he believed was a force for good he was a great admirer of prime minister william ewart gladstone whom he knew personally and admired his plans for ireland 16 stoker had a strong interest in science and medicine and a belief in progress some of his novels like the lady of the shroud 1909 can be seen as early science fiction stoker had an interest in the occult especially mesmerism but was also wary of occult fraud and believed strongly that superstition should be replaced by more scientific ideas in the mid 1890s stoker is rumoured to have become a member of the hermetic order of the golden dawn though there is no concrete evidence to support this claim 17 18 19 one of stoker s closest friends was j w brodie innis a major figure in the order and stoker himself hired pamela coleman smith as an artist at the lyceum theater edit posthumous the short story collection dracula s guest and other weird stories was published in 1914 by stoker s widow florence stoker the first film adaptation of dracula was released in 1922 and was named nosferatu it was directed by friedrich wilhelm murnau and starred max schreck as count orlock nosferatu was produced while florence stoker bram stoker s widow and literary executrix was still alive represented by the attorneys of the british incorporated society of authors she eventually sued the filmmakers her chief legal complaint was that she had been neither asked for permission for the adaptation nor paid any royalty the case dragged on for some years with mrs stoker demanding the destruction of the negative and all prints of the film the suit was finally resolved in the widow s favour in july 1925 some copies of the film survived however and the film has become well known the first authorised film version of dracula did not come about until almost a decade later when universal studios released tod browning s dracula starring bela lugosi because of the stokers frustrating history with dracula s copyright a great grandnephew of bram stoker canadian writer dacre stoker with encouragement from screenwriter ian holt decided to write a sequel that bore the stoker name to reestablish creative control over the original novel in 2009 dracula the un dead was released written by dacre stoker and ian holt both writers based their work on bram stoker s own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition along with their own research for the sequel this also marked dacre stoker s writing debut 20 21 in spring 2012 dacre stoker in collaboration with prof elizabeth miller presented the lost dublin journal written by bram stoker which had been kept by his great grandson noel dobbs stoker s diary entries shed a light on the issues that concerned him before his london years a remark about a boy who caught flies in a bottle might be a clue for the later development of the renfield character in dracula 22 on the 8 november 2012 stoker was honoured with a google doodle on google s homepage commemorating his 165th birthday 23 edit bibliography edit novels bram stoker commemorative plaque
