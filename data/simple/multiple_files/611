constant competition for archie s affections her other friends include ethel muggs midge klump and nancy woods and they all enjoy having slumber parties and shopping at the mall together aside from archie veronica frequently dates reggie mantle who has the wealth and possessions her father appreciates as well as a narcissism that rivals hers periodically she can be extremely snobbish and she will look down on those less fortunate than herself or sees herself as the rules of common society don t apply to her which causes her friends to be upset with her during those times she derisively refers to the public at large as the common horde at other times when she can be snobbish her father will punish her with having her credit cards confiscated in a five part story she openly sides with reggie and at least in this story acts as thoroughly obnoxious as he he began with framing archie for breakage at her home also causing some messes at school all the while framing archie for the damage one prank led to a tussle with betty cooper who thrashed him for beating her up she was helping archie with cleaning a store room and reggie mistook her for archie which led veronica to scold betty for being unladylike and nearly ruining reggies aristocratic profile the prank war ultimately was topped off with reggie dressing as dracula and trying to scare his rival eventually she finally realized that reggie was going way too far and berated herself for having supported him archie eventually wound up getting the last laugh when jughead takes the rotor out of reggie s car which stranded the two troublemakers however a couple of policemen found them and as reggie was in his dracula costume this led to veronica and reggie getting teased veronica was so embarrassed with this that when one of the policemen asked her hey lady do you have punctures in your neck she replied in an angry and humiliated tone no but i have a big hole in my head though a girl as popular as veronica can have her choice of dates she will drop any boy including reggie if she sees betty with archie veronica is often seen scheming to get archie from betty whenever she spots the two dating

temper however they usually manage to stand being around each other for archie s sake veronica s cousin leroy in elementary school has a mean spirited juvenile delinquent like personality when leroy visits he antagonizes archie even more than reggie does veronica also has a cousin named marcy aged 14 who enjoys science fiction and other things that veronica finds geeky so veronica considers her
