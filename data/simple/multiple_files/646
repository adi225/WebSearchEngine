physical or environmental conditions such as temperature sound pressure etc and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to a main location the more modern networks are bi directional also enabling control of sensor activity the development of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance today such networks are used in many industrial and consumer applications such as industrial process monitoring and control machine health monitoring and so on the wsn is built of nodes from a few to several hundreds or even thousands where each node is connected to one or sometimes several sensors each such sensor network node has typically several parts a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or connection to an external antenna a microcontroller an electronic circuit for interfacing with the sensors and an energy source usually a battery or an embedded form of energy harvesting a sensor node might vary in size from that of a shoebox down to the size of a grain of dust although functioning motes of genuine microscopic dimensions have yet to be created the cost of sensor nodes is similarly variable ranging from a few to hundreds of dollars depending on the complexity of the individual sensor nodes size and cost constraints on sensor nodes result in corresponding constraints on resources such as energy memory computational speed and communications bandwidth the topology of the wsns can vary from a simple star network to an advanced multi hop wireless mesh network the propagation technique between the hops of the network can be routing or flooding 1 2 in computer science and telecommunications wireless sensor networks are an active research area with numerous workshops and conferences arranged each year

analysis and data mining that can be conducted 8 edit forest fire detection a network of sensor nodes can be installed in a forest to detect when a fire has started the nodes can be equipped with sensors to measure temperature humidity and gases which are produced by fire in the trees or vegetation the early detection is crucial for a successful action of the firefighters thanks to wireless

detect the slight movements of soil and changes in various parameters that may occur before or during a landslide through the data gathered it may be possible to know the occurrence of landslides long before it actually happens edit water quality monitoring water quality monitoring involves analyzing water properties in dams rivers lakes amp oceans as well as underground water reserves the use of many wireless distributed sensors enables the creation of a more accurate map of the water status and allows the permanent deployment of monitoring stations in locations of difficult access without the need of manual data retrieval edit natural disaster prevention wireless sensor networks can effectively act to prevent the consequences of natural disasters like floods wireless nodes have successfully been deployed in rivers where changes of the water levels have to be monitored in real time edit industrial monitoring edit machine health monitoring wireless sensor networks have been developed for machinery condition based maintenance cbm as they offer significant cost savings and enable new functionalities in wired systems the installation of enough sensors is often limited by the cost of wiring previously inaccessible locations rotating machinery hazardous or restricted areas and mobile assets can now be reached with wireless sensors edit data logging main article data logging wireless sensor networks are also used for the collection of data for monitoring of environmental information this can be as simple as the monitoring of the temperature in a fridge to the level of water in overflow tanks in nuclear power plants the statistical information can then be used to show how systems have been working the advantage of wsns over conventional loggers is the live data feed that is possible edit industrial sense and control applications in recent research a vast number of wireless sensor network communication protocols have been developed while previous

established in a meshed wsn infrastructure 12 edit smart home monitoring monitoring the activities performed in a smart home is achieved using wireless sensors embedded within everyday objects forming a wsn state changes to objects based on human manipulation is captured by the wireless sensors network enabling activity support services 13 edit characteristics the main characteristics of a wsn include power consumption constrains for nodes using batteries or energy harvesting ability to cope with node failures mobility of nodes communication failures heterogeneity of nodes scalability to large scale of deployment ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions ease of use sensor nodes can be imagined as small computers extremely basic in terms of their interfaces and their components they usually consist of a processing unit with limited computational power and limited memory sensors or mems including specific conditioning circuitry a communication device usually radio transceivers or alternatively optical and a power source usually in the form of a battery other possible inclusions are energy harvesting modules secondary asics and possibly secondary communication devices e g rs 232 or usb the base stations are one or more components of the wsn with much more computational energy and communication resources they act as a gateway between sensor nodes and the end user as they typically forward data from the wsn on to a server other special components in routing based networks are routers designed to compute calculate and distribute the routing tables edit platforms edit standards and specifications several standards are currently either ratified or under development by organizations including wave2m for wireless sensor networks there are a number of standardization bodies in the field of wsns the ieee focuses on the physical and mac layers the internet engineering task force works on layers 3 and above in addition to these bodies such as the international society of automation provide vertical solutions covering all protocol layer finally there are also several non standard proprietary mechanisms and specifications standards are used far less in wsns than in other computing systems which makes most systems incapable of direct communication between different systems however predominant standards commonly used in wsn communications include wirelesshart ieee 1451 zigbee 802 15 4 zigbee ip 6lowpan edit hardware main article sensor node one major challenge in a wsn is to produce low cost and tiny sensor nodes there are an increasing number of small companies producing wsn hardware and the commercial situation can be compared to home computing in the 1970s many of the nodes are still in the research and development stage particularly their software also inherent to sensor network adoption is the use very low power methods for data acquisition edit software energy is the scarcest resource of wsn nodes and it determines the lifetime of wsns wsns are meant to be deployed in large numbers in various environments including remote and hostile regions where ad hoc communications are a key component for this reason algorithms and protocols need to address the following issues lifetime maximization robustness and fault tolerance self configuration lifetime maximization energy power consumption of the sensing device should be minimized and sensor nodes should be energy efficient since their limited energy resource determines their lifetime to conserve power the node should shut off the radio power supply when not in use some of the important topics in wsn software research are operating systems security mobility edit operating systems operating systems for wireless sensor network nodes are typically less complex than general purpose operating systems they more strongly resemble embedded systems for two reasons first wireless sensor networks are typically deployed with a particular application in mind rather than as a general platform second a need for low costs and low power leads most wireless sensor nodes to have low power microcontrollers ensuring that mechanisms such as virtual memory are either unnecessary or too expensive to implement it is therefore possible to use embedded operating systems such as ecos or uc os for sensor networks however such operating systems are often designed with real time properties tinyos 14 is perhaps the first 15 operating system specifically designed for wireless sensor networks tinyos is based on an event driven programming model instead of multithreading tinyos programs are composed of event handlers and tasks with run to completion semantics when an external event occurs such as an incoming data packet or a sensor reading tinyos signals the appropriate event handler to handle the event event handlers can post tasks that are scheduled by the tinyos kernel some time later liteos is a newly developed os for wireless sensor networks which provides unix like abstraction and support for the c programming language contiki is an os which uses a simpler programming style in c while providing advances such as 6lowpan and protothreads edit simulation of wsns at present agent based modeling and simulation is the only paradigm which allows the simulation of complex behavior in the environments of wireless sensors such as flocking 16 agent based simulation of wireless sensor and ad hoc networks is a relatively new paradigm agent based modelling was originally based on social simulation network simulators like opnet netsim and ns2 can be used to simulate a wireless sensor network edit other concepts edit distributed sensor network if a centralised architecture is used in a sensor network and the central node fails then the entire network will collapse however the reliability of the sensor network can be increased by using a distributed control architecture distributed control is used in wsns for the following reasons sensor nodes are prone to failure for better collection of data to provide nodes with backup in case of failure of the central node there is also no centralised body to allocate the resources and they have to be self organised edit data integration and sensor web the data gathered from wireless sensor networks is usually saved in the form of numerical data in a central base station additionally the open geospatial consortium ogc is specifying standards for interoperability interfaces and metadata encodings that enable real time integration of heterogeneous sensor webs into the internet allowing any individual to monitor or control wireless sensor networks through a web browser edit in network processing to reduce communication costs some algorithms remove or reduce nodes redundant sensor information and avoid forwarding data that is of no use as nodes can inspect the data they forward they can measure averages or directionality for example of readings from other nodes for example in sensing and monitoring applications it is generally the case that neighbouring sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values this kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires the techniques for in network data aggregation and mining edit see also list of ad hoc routing protocols ad hoc on demand
