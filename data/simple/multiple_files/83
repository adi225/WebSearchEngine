in chess and chess like games the endgame or end game or ending is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board the line between middlegame and endgame is often not clear and may occur gradually or with the quick exchange of a few pairs of pieces the endgame however tends to have different characteristics from the middlegame and the players have correspondingly different strategic concerns in particular pawns become more important endgames often revolve around attempting to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank the king which has to be protected in the middlegame owing to the threat of checkmate becomes a strong piece in the endgame it can be brought to the center of the board and be a useful attacking piece many of the greatest players throughout history have considered the endgame to be of paramount importance because endgame theory is finite citation needed whereas chess opening theory changes frequently giving way to middlegame positions that fall in and out of popularity endgame theory always remains constant many people have composed endgame studies endgame positions which are solved by finding a win for white when there is no obvious way of winning or a draw when it seems white must lose usually in the endgame the stronger side should try to exchange pieces knights bishops rooks and queens while avoiding the exchange of pawns this generally makes it easier for him to convert his advantage into a won game the defending side should strive for the opposite endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces that

and the end game starts whitaker amp hartleb 1960 with the usual system for chess piece relative value speelman considers that endgames are positions in which each player has thirteen or fewer points in material not counting the king alternatively an endgame is a position in which the king can be used actively but there are some famous exceptions to that speelman 1981 7 8 minev characterizes endgames as positions having four or fewer pieces other than kings and pawns minev 2004 5 some authors consider endgames to be positions without queens e g fine 1952 while others consider a position to be an endgame when each player has less than a queen plus rook in material flear considers an endgame to be where each player has at most one piece other than kings and pawns and positions with

the endgame starts when the player who is about to move can force a win or a draw against any variation of moves portisch amp s rk zy 1981 vii mednis and crouch address the question of what constitutes an endgame negatively the game is still in the middlegame if middlegame elements still describe the position the game is not in the endgame if these apply better development open files for attacking vulnerable king position misplaced pieces mednis amp crouch 1992 1 edit general considerations in endgames with pieces and pawns an extra pawn is a winning advantage in 50 to 60 percent of the cases it becomes more decisive if the stronger side has a positional advantage euwe amp meiden 1966 xvi in general the player with a material advantage tries to exchange pieces and reach the endgame in the endgame the player with a material advantage should usually try to exchange pieces but avoid the exchange of pawns dvoretsky amp yusupov 2008 134 there are some exceptions to this 1 endings in which both sides have two rooks plus pawns the player with more pawns has better winning chances if a pair of rooks are not exchanged and 2 bishops on opposite color with other pieces the stronger side should avoid exchanging the other pieces also when all of the pawns are on the same side of the board often the stronger side must exchange pawns to try to create a passed pawn in the endgame it is better for the player with more pawns to avoid too many pawn exchanges because they should be won for nothing also endings with pawns on both sides of the board are much easier to win a king and pawn endgame with an outside passed pawn should be a far easier win than a middlegame a rook ahead with the recent growth of computer chess an interesting development has been the creation of endgame databases which are tables of stored positions calculated by retrograde analysis such a database is called an endgame tablebase a program which incorporates knowledge from such a database is able to play perfect chess on reaching any position in the database max euwe and walter meiden give these five generalizations in king and pawn endings an extra pawn is decisive in more than 90 percent of the cases in endgames with pieces and pawns an extra pawn is a winning advantage in 50 to 60 percent of the cases it becomes more decisive if the stronger side has a positional advantage the king plays an important role in the endgame initiative is more important in the endgame than in other phases of the game in rook endgames the initiative is usually worth at least a pawn two connected passed pawns are very strong if they reach their sixth rank they are generally as powerful as a rook euwe amp meiden 1966 xvi xvii edit common types of endgames edit basic checkmates main article checkmate a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h checkmate with the rook these are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king with the pieces working together with their king in conjunction with its king a queen or a rook can easily checkmate a lone king but a single minor piece a bishop or knight cannot see wikibooks chess the endgame for a demonstration of these two checkmates two bishops plus their king can easily checkmate a lone king provided that the bishops move on opposite color squares two or more bishops on the same color can not checkmate a bishop and knight plus their king can also checkmate a lone king although the checkmate procedure is long up to 33 moves with correct play and is difficult for a player who does not know the correct technique two knights cannot force checkmate against a lone king see two knights endgame but if the weaker side also has a pawn checkmate is sometimes possible because positions which would be stalemate without the pawn are not stalemate with the additional pawn if the pawn is blocked by a knight on or behind the troitzky line the knights have a long theoretical win there are some other positions when the pawn is past the troitzky line in which the knights can force checkmate but the procedure is long and difficult in either case in competition the fifty move rule will often result in the game being drawn first while there is a board position that allows two knights to checkmate a lone king such requires a careless move by the weaker side to execute he cannot be driven into the corner edit king and pawn endings king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides international master cecil purdy said pawn endings are to chess as putting is to golf any endgame with pieces and pawns has the possibility of simplifying into a pawn ending nunn 2010 43 in king and pawn endings an extra pawn is decisive in more than 90 percent of the cases euwe amp meiden 1966 xvi getting a passed pawn is crucial a passed pawn is one which does not have an opposing pawn on its file or on adjacent files on its way to promotion nimzovich once said that a passed pawn has a lust to expand an outside passed pawn is particularly deadly the point of this is a decoy while the defending king is preventing it from queening the attacking king wins pawns on the other side opposition is an important technique that is used to gain an advantage when two kings are in opposition they are on the same file or rank with an empty square separating them the player having the move loses the opposition he must move his king and allow the opponent s king to advance note however that the opposition is a means to an end which is penetration into the enemy position if the attacker can penetrate without the opposition he should do so the tactics of triangulation and zugzwang as well as the theory of corresponding squares are often decisive edit king and pawn versus king m ller amp lamprecht diagram 2 11 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h white to move wins with 1 kb6 black to move

front of that or capture the pawn if the attacking king can prevent that the king will assist the pawn in being promoted to a queen or rook and checkmate can be achieved a rook pawn is an exception because the king may not be able to get out of the way of its pawn unlike most positions king and pawn endgames can usually be analyzed to a definite conclusion given enough skill and time an error in a king and pawn endgame almost always turns a win into a draw or a draw into a loss there is little chance for recovery accuracy is most important in these endgames there are three fundamental ideas in these endgames opposition triangulation and the r ti manoeuvre nunn 2007 113ff edit knight and pawn endings knight and pawn endgames feature clever maneuvering by the knights to capture opponent pawns while a knight is poor at chasing a passed pawn it is the ideal piece to block a passed pawn knights cannot lose a tempo so knight and pawn endgames have much in common with king and pawn endgames as a result mikhail botvinnik stated that a knight ending is really a pawn ending beliavsky amp mikhalchishin 2003 139 an outside passed pawn can outweigh a protected passed central pawn

bishop works on the light squares the other one working on dark squares are notorious for their drawish character many players in a poor position have saved themselves from a loss by trading down to such an endgame they are often drawn even when one side has a two pawn advantage since the weaker side can create a blockade on the squares which his bishop operates on interestingly the weaker side should often try to make his bishop bad by placing his pawns on the same color of his bishop in order to defend his remaining pawns thereby creating an impregnable fortress edit bishop versus knight endings with pawns current theory is that bishops are better than knights about 60 percent of the time in the endgame the more symmetrical the pawn structure the better it is for the knight the knight is best suited at an outpost in the center particularly where it cannot easily be driven away whereas the bishop is strongest when it can attack targets on both sides of the board or a series of squares of the same color beliavsky amp mikhalchishin 1995 122 fine and benko fine amp benko 2003 205 give four conclusions in general the bishop is better than the knight when there is a material advantage the difference between the bishop and knight is not very important however the bishop usually wins more easily than the knight if the material is even the position should be drawn however the bishop can exploit positional advantages more efficiently when most of the pawns are on the same color as the bishop i e a bad bishop the knight is better edit bishop and pawn versus knight m ller

enough to win an extra pawn is harder to convert to a win in a rook and pawn endgame than any other type of endgame except a bishop endgame with bishops on opposite colors rook endings are probably the deepest and most well studied endgames they are a common type of endgame in practice occurring in about 10 percent of all games including ones that do not reach an endgame emms 2008 7 these endgames occur frequently because rooks are often the last pieces to be exchanged the ability to play these endgames well is a major factor distinguishing masters from amateurs nunn 2007 125 when both sides have two rooks and pawns the stronger side usually has more winning chances than if each had only one rook emms 2008 141 three rules of thumb regarding rooks are worth noting rooks should almost always be placed behind passed pawns whether one s own or the opponent s the tarrasch rule a notable exception is in the ending of a rook and pawn versus a rook if the pawn is not too far advanced in that case the best place for the opposing rook is in front of the pawn rooks are very poor defenders relative to their attacking strength so it is often good to sacrifice a pawn for activity a rook on the seventh rank can wreak mayhem among the opponent s pawns the power of a rook on the seventh rank is not confined to the endgame the classic example is capablanca tartakower new york 1924 see annotated game without diagrams or java board an important winning position in the rook and pawn versus rook endgame is the so called lucena position if the side with the pawn can reach the lucena position he wins however there are several important drawing techniques such as the philidor position the back rank defense rook on the first rank for rook pawns and knight pawns only the frontal

some positions require up to sixty moves to win speelman tisdall amp wade 1993 7 if the attacking rook is two files from the pawn and the defending king is cut off on the other side the attacker normally wins with a few exceptions fine amp benko 2003 294 the rook and pawn versus rook is the most common of the piece and pawn versus piece endgames nunn 2007 148 the most difficult case of a rook and pawn versus a rook is when the attacking rook is one file over from the pawn and the defending king is cut off on the other side siegbert tarrasch gave the following rules for this case for a player defending against a pawn on the fifth or even sixth ranks to obtain a draw even after his king has been forced off the queening square the following conditions must obtain the file on which the pawn stands divides the board into two unequal parts the defending rook must stand in the longer part and give checks from the flank at the greatest possible distance from the attacking king nothing less than a distance of three files makes it possible for the rook to keep on giving check otherwise it would ultimately be attacked by the king the defending king must stand on the smaller part of

truer in practice than one might think benko 2007 189 edit queen and pawn endings in queen and pawn endings passed pawns have paramount importance because the queen can escort it to the queening

pawn see chess piece relative value three pawns are often enough to win against a minor piece but two pawns rarely are however with rooks on the board the bishop often outweighs the pawns this is because the bishop defends against enemy rook attacks while the bishop s own rook attacks enemy pawns and reduces the enemy rook to passivity this relates to rule 2 with rooks above a bishop is usually worth more than a knight a bishop is especially valuable when there are pawns on both wings of the board since it can intercept them quickly edit effect of tablebases on endgame theory endgame tablebases have made some minor corrections to historical endgame analysis but they have made some more significant changes to endgame theory too the fifty move rule is not taken into account in these

enabling the rook to put up a better defense but the queen still wins a people usually opt for a second rank defense with the rook on the second rank and the king behind it or symmetrical positions on the other edges of the board tablebases show that a third rank defense takes a while to breach which is difficult for a human to do b people had assumed that the rook needs to stay as close to the

diagram that they thought was a draw but it is actually a win for the queen nunn 2002 300ff in the diagram white checkmates in 43 moves starting with 1 qc7 the only winning move note that nunn says the general result is undoubtedly a draw but there are many losing positions some of them very lengthy on the other hand batsford chess endings states that 89 7 percent of the starting positions are wins for the queen speelman tisdall amp wade 1993 7 however these percentages can be misleading and most general results are based on the analysis of grandmasters using the tablebase data m ller amp lamprecht 2001 406 nunn 2002 324 for instance although nearly 90 percent of all of these positions are wins for the queen it is generally a draw if the king is not separated from the knights and they are on reasonable squares m ller amp lamprecht 2001 339 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h this position was thought to be drawn kling and horwitz 1851 but white wins two bishops versus a knight this was thought to be a draw but the bishops generally win however it takes up to 66 moves the position in the diagram was thought to be a draw for over one hundred years but tablebases show that white wins in 45 moves all of the long wins go through this type of semi fortress position it takes several moves to force black out of the temporary fortress in the corner then precise play with the bishops prevents black from forming the temporary fortress in another corner nunn 1995 265ff before computer analysis speelman listed this position as unresolved but probably a draw speelman 1981 109 queen and bishop versus two rooks this was thought to be a draw but the queen and bishop usually win it takes up to 84 moves nunn 2002 367ff rook and bishop versus bishop and

and yakov konoval announced that a position in the ending of a king two rooks and a knight versus a king and two rooks requires 290 moves to convert to a simpler winning endgame this type of ending is thought to be a draw in general the old record was 243 moves from a position in a rook and knight versus two knights endgame discovered by lewis stiller in 1991 7 endings of a rook and knight versus two knights are generally draws on march 10 2006 marc bourzutschky and yakov konoval announced a new record for the longest endgame requiring 330 moves to conversion to a simpler ending in may 2006 a record shattering 517 move endgame was announced marc bourzutschky found it using a program written by yakov konoval black s first move is 1 rd7 and white wins the rook in 517 moves see diagram it should be noted that such endgames do not necessarily represent strictly optimal play from both sides as black may delay checkmate by allowing an earlier conversion or white may accelerate it by delaying a conversion or not making one at all for example for the earlier position found by stiller if black plays to delay conversion as long as possible and white plays to convert as soon as possible white captures a knight on the 243rd move and checkmates on the 246th move 8 however if black and white play respectively to maximize and minimize the distance to checkmate white captures the first knight on the 242nd move but only checkmates on move 262 7 since space limitations make the computation of seven man tablebases using the distance to mate metric impractical the six man position discovered by stiller continues to be the longest forced checkmate discovered by computer although longer forced checkmates have been constructed 9 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b

classification endgames can be classified by the material on the board the standard classification system lists each player s material including the kings in the following order king queen bishops knights rooks pawn each piece is designated by its algebraic symbol for example if white has a king and pawn and black has only a king the endgame is classified kpk if white has bishop and knight and black has a rook the endgame is classified kbnkr note that knbkr would be incorrect bishops come before knights in positions with two or more bishops on the board a bishop signature may be added to clarify the relationship between the bishops two methods have been used the informal method is to designate one color of squares as x and the other color as y an endgame of kbpkb can be written kbpkb x y if the bishops are opposite colored or kbpkb x x if the bishops are same colored the more formal method is to use a four digit suffix of the form abcd a number of white light squared bishops b number of white dark squared bishops c number of black light squared bishops d number of black dark squared bishops thus the aforementioned endgame can be written kbpkb 1001 for opposite color bishops and kbpkb 1010 for same color bishops gbr code is an alternative method of endgame classification the encyclopedia of chess endings had a different classification scheme somewhat similar to the eco codes but it is not widely used the full system is a 53 page index that was contained in the book the best endings of capablanca and fischer the code starts with a letter representing the most powerful piece on the board not counting kings the order is queen rook bishop knight and then pawn figurines are used to stand for the pieces each of these has up to 100 subclassifications for instance r00 through r99 the first digit is a code for the pieces for instance r0 contains all endgames with a rook versus pawns and a rook versus a lone king r8 contains the double rook endgames and r9 contains the endings with more than four pieces the second digit is a classification for the number of pawns for instance r30 contains endgames with a rook versus a rook without pawns or with one pawn and r38 are rook versus rook endings in which one player has two extra pawns 10 edit frequency table the table below lists the most common endings in actual games by percentage percentage of
