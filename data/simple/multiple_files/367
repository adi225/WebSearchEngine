it has been suggested that medical practice be merged into this article or section discuss proposed since august 2011 the doctor by sir luke fildes 1891 in clinical practice doctors personally assess patients in order to diagnose treat and prevent disease using clinical judgment the doctor patient relationship typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient s medical history and medical record followed a medical interview 4 and a physical examination basic diagnostic medical devices e g stethoscope tongue depressor are typically used after examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms the doctor may order medical tests e g blood tests take a biopsy or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided during the encounter properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust the medical encounter is then documented in the medical record which is a legal document in many jurisdictions 5 followups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure the components of the medical interview 4 and encounter are chief complaint cc the reason for the current medical visit these are the symptoms they are in the patient s own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one also called presenting complaint history of present illness complaint hpi the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom current activity occupation hobbies what the patient actually does medications rx what drugs the patient takes including prescribed over the counter and home remedies as well as alternative and herbal medicines herbal remedies allergies are also recorded past medical history pmh pmhx concurrent medical problems past hospitalizations and operations injuries past infectious diseases and or vaccinations history of known allergies social history sh birthplace residences marital history social and economic status habits including diet medications tobacco alcohol family history fh listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient a family tree is sometimes used review of systems ros or systems inquiry a set of additional questions to ask which may be missed on hpi a general enquiry have you noticed any weight loss change in sleep quality fevers lumps and bumps etc followed by questions on the body s main organ systems heart lungs digestive tract urinary tract etc the physical examination is the examination of the patient looking for signs of disease symptoms are what the patient volunteers signs are what the healthcare provider detects by examination the healthcare provider uses the senses of sight hearing touch and sometimes smell e g in infection uremia diabetic ketoacidosis taste has been made redundant by the availability of modern lab tests four actions are taught as the basis of physical examination inspection palpation feel percussion tap to determine resonance characteristics and auscultation listen this order may be modified depending on the main focus of the examination e g a joint may be examined by simply look feel move having this set order is an educational tool that encourages practitioners to be systematic in their approach and refrain from using tools such as the stethoscope before they have fully evaluated the other modalities the clinical examination involves study of vital signs including height weight body temperature blood pressure pulse respiration rate hemoglobin oxygen saturation general appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease nutritional status presence of jaundice pallor or clubbing skin head eye ear nose and throat heent cardiovascular heart and blood vessels respiratory large airways and lungs abdomen and rectum genitalia and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant musculoskeletal including spine and extremities neurological consciousness awareness brain vision cranial nerves spinal cord and peripheral nerves psychiatric orientation mental state evidence of abnormal perception or thought it is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above laboratory and imaging studies results may be obtained if necessary the medical decision making mdm process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses the differential diagnoses along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient s problem the treatment plan may include ordering additional laboratory tests and studies starting therapy referral to a specialist or watchful observation follow up may be advised this process is used by primary care providers as well as specialists it may take only a few minutes if the problem is simple and straightforward on the other hand it may take weeks in a patient who has been hospitalized with bizarre symptoms or multi system problems with involvement by several specialists on subsequent visits the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history symptoms physical findings and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations edit institutions the hospital of santa maria della scala fresco by domenico di bartolo 1441 1442 contemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems legal credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments augmented on occasion by international organizations the characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided advanced industrial countries with the exception of the united states 6 7 and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single payer health care system or compulsory private or co operative health insurance this is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay delivery may be via private medical practices or by state owned hospitals and clinics or by charities most commonly by a combination of all three most tribal societies and the united states 6 7 provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole in such societies healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self insured it either directly or as part of an employment contract or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly modern drug ampoules transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system access to information on conditions treatments quality and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients consumers and therefore the incentives of medical professionals while the us healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness 8 new legislation may encourage greater openness there is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other edit delivery see also health care clinic hospital 160 and hospice provision of medical care is classified into primary secondary and tertiary care categories primary care medical services are provided by physicians physician assistants nurse practitioners or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care these occur in physician offices clinics nursing homes schools home visits and other places close to patients about 90 of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider these include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes secondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists these include both ambulatory care and inpatient services emergency rooms intensive care medicine surgery services physical therapy labor and delivery endoscopy units diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services hospice centers etc some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting tertiary care medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals these include trauma centers burn treatment centers advanced neonatology unit services organ transplants high risk pregnancy radiation oncology etc modern medical care also depends on information still delivered in many health care settings on paper records but increasingly nowadays by electronic means edit branches working together as an interdisciplinary team many highly trained health professionals besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care examples include nurses emergency medical technicians and paramedics laboratory scientists pharmacists physician assistants podiatrists physiotherapists respiratory therapists speech therapists occupational therapists radiographers dietitians and bioengineers the scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields dentistry while considered by some a separate discipline from medicine is a medical field a patient admitted to hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem e g the cardiology team who then may interact with other specialties e g surgical radiology to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications developments physicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine which are listed below there are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in the main branches of medicine are basic sciences of medicine this is what every physician is educated in and some return to in biomedical research medical specialties interdisciplinary fields where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions edit basic sciences anatomy is the study of the physical structure of organisms in contrast to macroscopic or gross anatomy cytology and histology are concerned with microscopic structures biochemistry is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms especially the structure and function of their chemical components biomechanics is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of mechanics biostatistics is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense a knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning evaluation and interpretation of medical research it is also fundamental to epidemiology and evidence based medicine biophysics is an interdisciplinary science that uses the methods of physics and physical chemistry to study biological systems cytology is the microscopic study of individual cells louis pasteur in his laboratory 1885 embryology is the study of the early development of organisms endocrinology is the study of hormones and their effect throughout the body of animals epidemiology is the study of the demographics of disease processes and includes but is not limited to the study of epidemics genetics is the study of genes and their role in biological inheritance histology is the study of the structures of biological tissues by light microscopy electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry immunology is the study of the immune system which includes the innate and adaptive immune system in humans for example medical physics is the study of the applications of physics principles in medicine microbiology is the study of microorganisms including protozoa bacteria fungi and viruses molecular biology is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of replication transcription and translation of the genetic material neuroscience includes those disciplines of science that are related to the study of the nervous system a main focus of neuroscience is the biology and physiology of the human brain and spinal cord some related clinical specialties include neurology neurosurgery and psychiatry nutrition science theoretical focus and dietetics practical focus is the study of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease especially in determining an optimal diet medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for diabetes cardiovascular diseases weight and eating disorders allergies malnutrition and neoplastic diseases pathology as a science is the study of disease the causes course progression and resolution thereof pharmacology is the study of drugs and their actions photobiology is the study of the interactions between non ionizing radiation and living organisms physiology is the study of the normal functioning of the body and the underlying regulatory mechanisms radiobiology is the study of the interactions between ionizing radiation and living organisms toxicology is the study of hazardous effects of drugs and poisons edit specialties main article medical specialty in the broadest meaning of medicine there are many different specialties in the uk most specialities will have their own body or college collectively known as the royal colleges although currently not all use the term royal which have their own entrance exam the development of a speciality is often driven by new technology such as the development of effective anaesthetics or ways of working e g emergency departments which leads to the desire to form a unifying body of doctors and thence the prestige of administering their own exam within medical circles specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories medicine and surgery medicine refers to the practice of non operative medicine and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in internal medicine in the uk this would traditionally have been evidenced by obtaining the mrcp an exam allowing membership of the royal college of physicians or the equivalent college in scotland or ireland surgery refers to the practice of operative medicine and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in general surgery in the uk membership of the royal college of surgeons of england mrcs there are some specialties of medicine that at the present time do not fit easily into either of these categories such as radiology pathology or anesthesia most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above for example anaesthesia developed first as a faculty of the royal college of surgeons for which mrcs frcs would have been required before becoming the royal college of anaesthetists and membership of the college is by sitting the frca fellowship of the royal college of anesthetists edit surgery main article surgery surgeons in an operating room surgical specialties employ operative treatment in addition surgeons must decide when an operation is necessary and also treat many non surgical issues particularly in the surgical intensive care unit sicu where a variety of critical issues arise surgeons must also manage pre operative post operative and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards surgery has many sub specialties including general surgery cardiovascular surgery colorectal surgery neurosurgery maxillofacial surgery oncologic surgery orthopedic surgery otolaryngology plastic surgery podiatric surgery transplant surgery trauma surgery urology vascular surgery and pediatric surgery in some centers anesthesiology is part of the division of surgery for historical and logistical reasons although it is not a surgical discipline other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures such as ophthalmology and dermatology but are not considered surgical sub specialties per se surgical training in the u s requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school sub specialties of surgery often require seven or more years in addition fellowships can last an additional one to three years because post residency fellowships can be competitive many trainees devote two additional years to research thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school furthermore surgical training can be very difficult and time consuming edit medicine as a specialty main article internal medicine internal medicine is the medical specialty concerned with the diagnosis management and nonsurgical treatment of unusual or serious diseases either of one particular organ system or of the body as a whole according to some sources an emphasis on internal structures is implied 9 in north america specialists in internal medicine are commonly called internists elsewhere especially in commonwealth nations such specialists are often called physicians 10 these terms internist or physician in the narrow sense common outside north america generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics pathology psychiatry and especially surgery and its subspecialities because their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations internists do much of their work in hospitals formerly many internists were not subspecialized such general physicians would see any complex nonsurgical problem this style of practice has become much less common in modern urban practice most internists are subspecialists that is they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge for example gastroenterologists and nephrologists specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys 11 in the commonwealth of nations and some other countries specialist pediatricians and geriatricians are also described as specialist physicians or internists who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system elsewhere especially in north america general pediatrics is often a form of primary care there are many subspecialities or subdisciplines of internal medicine cardiology critical care medicine endocrinology gastroenterology geriatrics haematology hepatology infectious diseases nephrology oncology pediatrics pulmonology pneumology respirology rheumatology sleep medicine training in internal medicine as opposed to surgical training varies considerably across the world see the articles on medical education and physician for more details in north america it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school which can then be followed by a one to three year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above in general resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery averaging about 60 hours per week in the usa this difference does not apply in the uk where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average edit diagnostic specialties clinical laboratory sciences are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients in the united states these services are supervised by a pathologist the personnel that work in these medical laboratory departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees but who usually hold an undergraduate medical technology degree who actually perform the tests assays and procedures needed for providing the specific services subspecialties include transfusion medicine cellular pathology clinical chemistry hematology clinical microbiology and clinical immunology pathology as a medical specialty is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic physiologic changes produced by them as a diagnostic specialty pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in evidence based medicine many modern molecular tests such as flow cytometry polymerase chain reaction pcr immunohistochemistry cytogenetics gene rearrangements studies and fluorescent in situ hybridization fish fall within the territory of pathology radiology is concerned with imaging of the human body e g by x rays x ray computed tomography ultrasonography and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography nuclear medicine is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances radiopharmaceuticals to the body which can then be imaged outside the body by a gamma camera or a pet scanner each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts a tracer that is specific for the function under study e g neurotransmitter pathway metabolic pathway blood flow or other and a radionuclide usually either a gamma emitter or a positron emitter there is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the pet ct scanner clinical neurophysiology is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system these kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of 1 spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity or 2 stimulus evoked responses subspecialties include electroencephalography electromyography evoked potential nerve conduction study and polysomnography sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional edit other major specialties the followings are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above mentioned groups anesthesiology also known as anaesthetics concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient the anesthesiologist s role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs i e brain heart kidneys functions and postoperative pain outside of the operating room the anesthesiology physician also served the same function in the labor amp delivery ward and some are specialized in critical medicine dermatology is concerned with the skin and its diseases in the uk dermatology is a subspecialty of general medicine emergency medicine is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life threatening conditions including trauma surgical medical pediatric and psychiatric emergencies family medicine family practice general practice or primary care is in many countries the first port of call for patients with non emergency medical problems family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices emergency room coverage inpatient care and nursing home care obstetrics and gynecology often abbreviated as ob gyn american english or obs amp gynae british english are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs reproductive medicine and fertility medicine are generally practiced by gynecological specialists medical genetics is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders neurology is concerned with diseases of the nervous system in the uk neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine ophthalmology exclusively concerned with the eye and ocular adnexa combining conservative and surgical therapy pediatrics ae or paediatrics be is devoted to the care of infants children and adolescents like internal medicine there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges organ systems disease classes and sites of care delivery physical medicine and rehabilitation or physiatry is concerned with functional improvement after injury illness or congenital disorders podiatric medicine study of diagnosis and medical treatment of disorders of the foot ankle lower limb hip and lower back psychiatry is the branch of medicine concerned with the bio psycho social study of the etiology diagnosis treatment and prevention of cognitive perceptual emotional and behavioral disorders related non medical fields include psychotherapy and clinical psychology preventive medicine is the branch of medicine concerned with preventing disease community health or public health is an aspect of health services concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis occupational medicine s principal role is the provision of health advice to organizations and individuals to ensure that the highest standards of health and safety at work can be achieved and maintained aerospace medicine deals with medical problems related to flying and space travel edit interdisciplinary fields some interdisciplinary sub specialties of medicine include addiction medicine deals with the treatment of addiction medical ethics deals with ethical and moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine biomedical engineering is a field dealing with the application of engineering principles to medical practice clinical pharmacology is concerned with how systems of therapeutics interact with patients conservation medicine studies the relationship between human and animal health and environmental conditions also known as ecological medicine environmental medicine or medical geology disaster medicine deals with medical aspects of emergency preparedness disaster mitigation and management diving medicine or hyperbaric medicine is the prevention and treatment of diving related problems evolutionary medicine is a perspective on medicine derived through applying evolutionary theory forensic medicine deals with medical questions in legal context such as determination of the time and cause of death type of weapon used to inflict trauma reconstruction of the facial features using remains of deceased skull thus aiding identification gender based medicine studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease hospice and palliative medicine is a relatively modern branch of clinical medicine that deals with pain and symptom relief and emotional support in patients with terminal illnesses including cancer and heart failure hospital medicine is the general medical care of hospitalized patients physicians whose primary professional focus is hospital medicine are called hospitalists in the usa and canada the term most responsible physician mrp or attending physician is also used interchangeably to describe this role laser medicine involves the use of lasers in the diagnostics and or treatment of various conditions medical humanities includes the humanities literature philosophy ethics history and religion social science anthropology cultural studies psychology sociology and the arts literature theater film and visual arts and their application to medical education and practice medical informatics medical computer science medical information and ehealth are relatively recent fields that deal with the application of computers and information technology to medicine nosology is the classification of diseases for various purposes nosokinetics is the science subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in health and social care systems pain management also called pain medicine or algiatry is the medical discipline concerned with the relief of pain pharmacogenomics is a form of individualized medicine podiatric medicine study of diagnosis and medical treatment of

treatment and prevention and rehabilitation of sports exercise injuries such as muscle spasms muscle tears injuries to ligaments ligament tears or ruptures and their repair in athletes amateur and professional the team includes specialty physicians and surgeons athletic trainers physical therapists psychiatrists and or psychologists coaches other personnel and of course the athlete therapeutics is the field more commonly referenced in earlier periods of history of the various remedies that can be used to treat disease and promote health 12 travel medicine or emporiatrics deals with health problems of international travelers or travelers across highly different environments urgent care focuses on delivery of unscheduled walk in care outside of the hospital emergency department for injuries and illnesses that are not severe enough to require care in an emergency department in some jurisdictions this function is combined with the emergency room veterinary medicine veterinarians apply similar techniques as physicians to the care of animals wilderness medicine entails the practice of medicine in the wild where conventional medical facilities may not be available many other health science fields e g dietetics edit education main articles medical education and medical school painted by toulouse lautrec in the year of his own death an examination in the paris faculty of medicine 1901 medical education and training varies around the world it typically involves entry level education at a university medical school followed by a period of supervised practice or internship and or residency this can be followed by postgraduate vocational training a variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education still itself a focus of active research in canada and the united states of america a doctor of medicine degree often abbreviated m d or a doctor of osteopathic medicine degree often abbreviated as d o and unique to the united states must be completed in a recognized university many regulatory authorities require continuing medical education since knowledge techniques and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate the means through which doctors upgrade their medical knowledge include medical journals seminars conferences and online programs apart form others edit medical ethics main article medical ethics medical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine as a scholarly discipline medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history philosophy theology and sociology six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are autonomy the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment voluntas aegroti suprema lex beneficence a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient salus aegroti suprema lex justice concerns the distribution of scarce health resources and the decision of who gets what treatment fairness and equality non maleficence first do no harm primum non nocere respect for persons the patient and the person treating the patient have the right to be treated with dignity truthfulness and honesty the concept of informed consent has increased in importance since the historical events of the doctors trial of the nuremberg trials and tuskegee syphilis experiment values such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts when moral values are in conflict the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis sometimes no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists and occasionally the values of the medical community i e the hospital and its staff conflict with the values of the individual patient family or larger non medical community conflicts can also arise between health care providers or among family members some argue for example that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse blood transfusions considering them life saving and truth telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the hiv era edit legal controls in most countries it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered in general this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization which may ask the applicant to pass exams this restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards it is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against charlatans that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain while the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in evidence based western or hippocratic medicine they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health in the european union the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated a profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification the regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine in the eu member states eea countries and switzerland this list is covered by the directive 2005 36 ec doctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of medical malpractice and be subject to civil criminal or professional sanctions edit criticism of modern medicine according to paul farmer the main problem for modern medicine is lack of access in poor regions there is an outcome gap between the rich and poor that is most noticeable with expensive to treat diseases like aids and tuberculosis the majority of medical resources and therapies are concentrated in the rich low incidence regions such as the west on the other hand countries in the developing world have high rates of hiv but lack the resources to treat them 13 medical errors and overmedication are also the focus of complaints and negative coverage practitioners of human factors engineering believe that there is much that medicine may usefully gain by emulating concepts in aviation safety where it is recognized that it is dangerous to place too much responsibility on one superhuman individual and expect him or her not to make errors reporting systems and checking mechanisms are becoming more common in identifying sources of error and improving practice clinical versus statistical algorithmic diagnostic methods were famously examined in psychiatric practice in a 1954 book by paul e meehl which found statistical methods superior 14 a 2000 meta analysis comparing these methods in both psychology and medicine found that statistical or mechanical diagnostic methods were in general although not always superior 14 disparities in quality of care given among local demographics are often an additional cause of controversy 15 for example elderly mentally ill patients received poorer care during hospitalization in a 2008 study 16 rural poor african american men were used in an infamous study of syphilis that denied them basic medical care edit honors and awards main article nobel prize in physiology or medicine the highest honor awarded in medicine is the nobel prize in medicine awarded since 1901 by the nobel assembly at karolinska institutet edit history main article timeline of medicine and medical technology edit ancient world statuette of ancient egyptian physician imhotep the first physician from antiquity known by name prehistoric medicine incorporated plants herbalism animal parts and minerals in many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests shamans or medicine men well known spiritual systems include animism the notion of inanimate objects having spirits spiritualism an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits shamanism the vesting of an individual with mystic powers and divination magically obtaining the truth the field of medical anthropology examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health health care and related issues an ancient greek patient gets medical treatment this aryballos circa 480 470 bce now in paris s louvre museum probably contained healing oil the greek physician hippocrates ca 460 bce ca 370 bce considered the father of medicine 17 18 early records on medicine have been discovered from ancient egyptian medicine babylonian medicine ayurvedic medicine in the indian subcontinent classical chinese medicine predecessor to the modern traditional chinese medicine and ancient greek medicine and roman medicine the egyptian imhotep 3rd millennium bc is the first physician in history known by name earliest records of dedicated hospitals come from mihintale in sri lanka where evidence of dedicated medicinal treatment facilities for patients are found 19 20 the indian surgeon sushruta described numerous surgical operations including the earliest forms of plastic surgery 21 dubious discuss 22 23 the greek physician hippocrates the father of medicine 17 18 laid the foundation for a rational approach to medicine hippocrates introduced the hippocratic oath for physicians which is still relevant and in use today and was the first to categorize illnesses as acute chronic endemic and epidemic and use terms such as exacerbation relapse resolution crisis paroxysm peak and convalescence 24 25 the greek physician galen was also one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations including brain and eye surgeries after the fall of the western roman empire and the onset of the early middle ages the greek tradition of medicine went into decline in western europe although it continued uninterrupted in the eastern roman byzantine empire most of our knowledge of ancient hebrew medicine during the 1st 160 millennium 160 bc comes from the torah i e 160 the five books of moses which contain various health related laws and rituals the hebrew contribution to the development of modern medicine started in the byzantine era with the physician asaph the jew 26 edit middle ages after 750 ce the muslim world had the works of hippocrates galen and sushruta translated into arabic and islamic physicians engaged in some significant medical research notable islamic medical pioneers include the polymath avicenna who along with imhotep and hippocrates has also been called the father of medicine 27 28 he wrote the canon of medicine considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine 29 others include abulcasis 30 avenzoar 31 ibn al nafis 32 and averroes 33 rhazes 34 was one of first to question the greek theory of humorism which nevertheless remained influential in both medieval western and medieval islamic medicine 35 the islamic bimaristan hospitals were an early example of public hospitals 36 37 however the fourteenth and fifteenth century black death was just as devastating to the middle east as to europe and it has even been argued that western europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the middle east 38 in the early modern period important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in europe including gabriele falloppio and william harvey the major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection especially during the black death in the 14th and 15th centuries of what may be called the traditional authority approach to science and medicine this was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so then that was the way it was and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly which was paralleled by a similar shift in european society in general see copernicus s rejection of ptolemy s theories on astronomy physicians like vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past the main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were materia medica and pharmacopoeia andreas vesalius was an author of one of the most influential books on human anatomy de humani corporis fabrica 39 french surgeon ambroise par is considered as one of the fathers of surgery bacteria and microorganisms were first observed with a microscope by antonie van leeuwenhoek in 1676 initiating the scientific field microbiology 40 independently from ibn al nafis michael servetus rediscovered the pulmonary circulation but this discovery did not reach the public cause it was written down for the first time in the manuscript of paris 41 in 1546 and later published in the theological work which he paid with his life in 1553 later this was described by renaldus columbus and andrea cesalpino partly based on the works by the italian surgeon and anatomist renaldus columbus the english physician william harvey described the circulatory system 42 herman boerhaave is sometimes referred to as a father of physiology due to his exemplary teaching in leiden and textbook institutiones medicae 1708 it is said that the 17th century french physician pierre fauchard started dentistry science as we know it today and he has been named the father of modern dentistry 43 edit modern paul louis simond injecting a plague vaccine in karachi 1898 veterinary medicine was for the first time truly separated from human medicine in 1761 when the french veterinarian claude bourgelat founded the world s first veterinary school in lyon france before this medical doctors treated both humans and other animals modern scientific biomedical research where results are testable and reproducible began to replace early western traditions based on herbalism the greek four humours and other such pre modern notions the modern era really began with edward jenner s discovery of the smallpox vaccine at the end of the 18th century inspired by the method of inoculation earlier practiced in asia robert koch s discoveries around 1880 of the transmission of disease by bacteria and then the discovery of antibiotics around 1900 the post 18th century modernity period brought more groundbreaking researchers from europe from germany and austria doctors rudolf virchow wilhelm conrad r ntgen karl landsteiner and otto loewi made notable contributions in the united kingdom alexander

kitasato shibasabur and france jean martin charcot claude bernard paul broca and others did significant work russian nikolai korotkov also did significant work as did sir william osler and harvey cushing alexander fleming s discovery of penicillin in september 1928 marks the start of modern antibiotics as science and technology developed medicine became more reliant upon medications throughout history and in europe right until the late 18th century not only animal and plant products were used as medicine but also human body parts and fluids 44 pharmacology developed from herbalism and many drugs are still derived from plants atropine ephedrine warfarin aspirin digoxin vinca alkaloids taxol hyoscine etc vaccines were discovered by edward jenner and louis pasteur the first antibiotic was arsphenamine salvarsan discovered by paul ehrlich in 1908 after he observed that bacteria took up toxic dyes that human cells did not the first major class of antibiotics was the sulfa drugs derived by german chemists originally from azo dyes pharmacology has become increasingly sophisticated modern biotechnology allows drugs targeted towards specific physiological processes to be developed sometimes designed for compatibility with the body to reduce side effects genomics and knowledge of human genetics is having some influence on medicine as the causative genes of most monogenic genetic
