gerard salton 8 march 1927 in nuremberg 28 august 1995 also known as gerry salton was a professor of computer science at cornell university salton was perhaps the leading computer scientist working in the field of information retrieval during his time his group at cornell developed the smart information retrieval system which he initiated when he was at harvard salton was born gerhard anton sahlmann on march 8 1927 in nuremberg germany he received a bachelor s 1950 and master s 1952 degree in mathematics from brooklyn college and a ph d from harvard in applied mathematics in 1958 the last of howard aiken s doctoral students and taught there until 1965 when he joined cornell university and co founded its department of computer science salton was perhaps most well known for developing the now widely used vector space model for information retrieval 1 in this model both documents and queries are represented as vectors of term counts and the similarity between a document and a query is given by the cosine between the term vector and the document vector in this paper he also introduced tf idf or term frequency inverse document frequency a model in which the score of a term in the a document is the ratio of the number of terms in that document divided by the frequency of the number of documents in which that term occurs the concept of inverse document frequency a measure of specificity had been introduced in 1972 by karen sparck jones 2 later in life he became interested in automatic text summarization and analysis 3 as well as automatic hypertext generation 4 he published over 150 research articles and 5 books during his life salton was editor in chief of the communications of the acm and the journal of the acm and chaired special interest group on information retrieval sigir he was an associate editor of the acm transactions on information systems he was an acm fellow elected 1995 received an award of merit from the american society for information science 1989 and was the first recipient of the sigir award for outstanding contributions to study of information retrieval 1983 now called the gerard salton award edit bibliography salton automatic information organization and retrieval 1968 gerard salton 1975 a theory of indexing society for industrial and applied mathematics pp 160 56 and michael j mcgill introduction to modern information retrieval 1983 isbn 0 07 054484 0 gerard salton 1989 automatic text processing addison wesley publishing company pp 160 530 isbn 160 0 201 12227 8 dblp bibliography g salton a wong and c s yang 1975 a vector space model for automatic indexing communications of the acm vol 18 nr 11 pages 613 620 article in which a vector space model was presented edit references g salton a wong c s yang a vector space model for automatic indexing communications of the acm v 18 n 11 p 613 620 nov 1975 sp rck jones karen 1972 a statistical interpretation of term specificity and its application in retrieval journal of documentation 28 1 11 21 doi 10 1108 eb026526 http www soi city ac uk ser idfpapers ksj orig pdf salton buckley allan singhal automatic analysis theme generation and summarization of machine readable texts science 264 3 june 1994 http www cs cornell edu info department annual95 faculty salton html edit external links in memoriam 1 the most influential paper gerard salton never wrote this 2004 library trends paper by david dubin serves as a historical review of the metamorphosis of the term discrimination value model tdv into the vector space model as an information retrieval model vsm as an ir model this paper calls into question what the information retrieval research community believed salton s vector space model was originally intended to model what much later became an information retrieval model was originally a data centric mathematical computational model used as an explanatory device in addition dubin s paper points out that a 1975 salton paper oft cited does not exist but is probably a combination of two other papers neither of which actually refers to the vsm as an ir model authority control viaf 108172047 persondata name salton gerard alternative names short description american computer scientist date of birth 8 march 1927 place of birth date of death 28 august 1995 place of death
