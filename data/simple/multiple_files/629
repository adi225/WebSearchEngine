an html form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing forms resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using checkboxes radio buttons or text fields for example forms can be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order a product or can be used to retrieve search results from a search engine contents 1 description 2

description sample form the form is enclosed in an html table for visual layout forms are enclosed in the html form tag this tag specifies the communication endpoint the data entered into the form should be submitted to and the method of submitting it get or post forms can be made up of standard graphical user interface elements text input a simple text box that allows input of a single line of text an alternative password is used for security purposes in which the characters typed in are invisible or replaced by symbols such as checkbox a check box radio a radio button file a file select control for uploading a file reset a reset button that when activated tells the browser to restore the values to their initial values submit a button that tells the browser to take action on the form typically to send it to a server textarea much like the text input field except a textarea allows for multiple rows of data to be shown and entered select a drop down list that displays a list of items a user can select from the sample image on the right shows all of these elements a text box asking for your name a pair of radio buttons asking you to pick your sex a select box giving you a list of eye colors to choose from a pair of check boxes to click on if they apply to you a text area to describe your athletic ability a submit button to send it to the server these basic elements provide most common graphical user interface gui elements but not all for example there are no equivalents to a combo box tree view or grid view a grid view however can be mimicked by using a standard html table with each cell containing a text input element a tree view could also be mimicked through nested tables or more semantically appropriately nested lists in both cases a server side process is responsible for processing the information while javascript handles the user interaction implementations of these interface elements are available through javascript libraries such as jquery html 4 introduced the label tag which is intended to represent a caption in a user interface and can be associated with a specific form control by specifying the id attribute of the control in the label tag s for attribute 1 html 5 introduces a number of input tags that can be represented by other interface elements some are based upon text input fields and are intended to input and validate specific common data these include email to enter email addresses tel for telephone numbers number for credit card numbers and security codes there are additional attributes to specify required fields fields that should have keyboard focus when the web page containing the form is loaded and placeholder text that is displayed within the field but is not user input such as the search text displayed in many search input fields before a search term is entered the date input type displays a calendar from which the user can select a date or date range 2 3 when data that has been entered into html forms is submitted the names and values in the form elements are encoded and sent to the server in an http request message using get or post historically an email transport was also used 4 the default mime type internet media type application x www form urlencoded is based on a very early version of the general uri percent encoding rules with a number of modifications such as newline normalization and replacing spaces with instead of 20 another possible encoding internet media type multipart form data is also available and is common for post based file submissions edit html forms combined with programming languages forms are usually combined with programs written in various programming languages to allow developers to create dynamic web sites the most popular languages include both client side and or server side languages although any programming language can be used on the server to process a form s data the most commonly used languages are scripting languages which tend to have stronger string handling functionality than programming languages such as c and also have automatic memory management which helps to prevent buffer overrun attacks edit client side the de facto client side scripting language for web sites is javascript using javascript on the document object model dom leads to the method of dynamic html that allows dynamic creation and modification of a web page within the browser while client side languages used in conjunction with forms are limited they often can serve to do pre validation of the form data and or to prepare the form data to send to a server side program edit server side server side programs can do a vast assortment of tasks to create dynamic web sites from authenticating a login through for example lightweight directory access protocol ldap to retrieving and storing data in a database to spell checking to sending e mail quite unlike client side programs some server side program requests must pass through the web server s common gateway interface to execute the program to actually perform the tasks the advantage of server side over client side is the concentration of functionality onto one computer the server instead of relying on each web browser implementing all of the various functions the same processing forms on the server also results in greater security from not trusting data supplied by the client registration form of php based e commerce web shop software zencart some of the interpreted languages commonly used php python ruby perl jsp adobe coldfusion some of the compiled languages commonly used java c with asp net edit php php is one very common language used for server side languages and is one of the few languages created specifically for web programming 5 6 to use php with an html form the url of the php script is specified in the action attribute of the form tag the target php file then accesses the data passed by the form through php s post or get variables depending on the value of the method attribute used in the form here is a basic form handler php script that will post the form s contents in this case user to the page using get form html lt html gt lt body gt lt form action form handler php method get gt user name lt input name user type text gt lt input type submit gt lt form gt lt body gt lt html gt form handler php lt html gt lt body gt lt php this will print whatever the user put into the form on the form html page name get user echo hello name gt lt body gt lt html gt edit perl perl is another language often used for web development perl scripts are traditionally used as common gateway interface applications cgis in fact perl is such a common way to write cgis that the two are often confused cgis may be written in other languages than perl compatibility with multiple languages is a design goal of the cgi protocol and there are other ways to make perl scripts interoperate with a web server than using cgi such as fastcgi or apache s mod perl perl cgis were once a very common way to write web applications but not being specifically designed for web development perl is now often viewed as less practical both for developers and users than specialized languages like php 7 8 9 this is especially true if perl modules would need to be installed on the web host or if wanting to use a non cgi environment that might require additional configuration on the web server for these reasons a lot of cheap web hosts nowadays effectively only support php and developers of web applications often seek compatibility with them a modern perl 5 cgi using the standard cgi module with a form similar to the one above might look like form handler pl usr bin perl use cgi qw standard user param user print header print html body p hello user edit form to email scripts among the simplest and most commonly needed types of server side script is that which simply emails the contents of a submitted form this kind of script is frequently exploited by spammers however and many of the most popular form to email scripts in use are vulnerable to be hijacked for spamming purposes one of the most popular scripts of this type was formmail pl made by matt s script archive today this script is no longer widely used in new development due to lack of updates security concerns and configuration difficulty alternatives to formmail pl that are written in php such as the more feature rich formtoemail have now become more widely used edit form builders some companies offer forms as a hosted service usually these companies give some kind of visual editor reporting tools and infrastructure to create and host the forms that can be embedded into webpages web hosting companies such as bluehost and doteasy provide templates to their clients as an add on free service other form hosting services offer free contact forms that a user can install on their own website by pasting the service s code into the site s html edit see also captcha postback
