everything on computers that is not text or sound 1 typically the term computer graphics refers to several different things the representation and manipulation of image data by a computer the various technologies used to create and manipulate images the sub field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content see study of computer graphics computer graphics is widespread today computer imagery is found on television in newspapers for example in weather reports or for example in all kinds of medical investigation and surgical procedures a well constructed graph can present complex statistics in a form that is easier to understand and interpret in the media such graphs are used to illustrate papers reports thesis and other presentation material 2 many powerful tools have been developed to visualize data computer generated imagery can be categorized into several different types 2d 3d and animated graphics as technology has improved 3d computer graphics have become more common but 2d computer graphics are still widely used computer graphics has emerged as a sub field of computer science which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content over the past decade other specialized fields have been developed like information visualization and scientific visualization more concerned with the visualization of three dimensional phenomena architectural meteorological medical biological etc where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes surfaces illumination sources and so forth perhaps with a dynamic time component 3 edit history see also history of computer animation sage sector control room the phrase computer graphics was coined in 1960 by william fetter a graphic designer for boeing 4 the field of computer graphics developed with the emergence of computer graphics hardware early projects like the whirlwind and sage projects introduced the crt as a viable display and interaction interface and introduced the light pen as an input device edit initial 1960s developments further advances in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics in 1959 the tx 2 computer was developed at mit s lincoln laboratory the tx 2 integrated a number of new man machine interfaces a light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using ivan sutherland s revolutionary sketchpad software 4 using a light pen sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen save them and even recall them later the light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip this cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed in front of a computer screen and the screen s electron gun fired directly at it by simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment once that was determined the computer could then draw a cursor at that location sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced even today many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early sketchpad program one example of this is in drawing constraints if one wants to draw a square for example they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box one can simply specify that they want to draw a box and then specify the location and size of the box the software will then construct a perfect box with the right dimensions and at the right location another example is that sutherland s software modeled objects not just a picture of objects in other words with a model of a car one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car it could stretch the body of the car without deforming the tires edit further 1961 developments spacewar running on the computer history museum s pdp 1 also in 1961 another student at mit steve russell created the first video game spacewar written for the dec pdp 1 spacewar was an instant success and copies started flowing to other pdp 1 owners and eventually even dec got a copy the engineers at dec used it as a diagnostic program on every new pdp 1 before shipping it the sales force picked up on this quickly enough and when installing new units would run the world s first video game for their new customers e e zajac a scientist at bell telephone laboratory btl created a film called simulation of a two giro gravity attitude control system in 1963 5 in this computer generated film zajac showed how the attitude of a satellite could be altered as it orbits the earth he created the animation on an ibm 7090 mainframe computer also at btl ken knowlton frank sindon and michael noll started working in the computer graphics field sindon created a film called force mass and motion illustrating newton s laws of motion in operation around the same time other scientists were creating computer graphics to illustrate their research at lawrence radiation laboratory nelson max created the films flow of a viscous fluid and propagation of shock waves in a solid form boeing aircraft created a film called vibration of an aircraft it was not long before major corporations started taking an interest in computer graphics trw lockheed georgia general electric and sperry rand are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid 1960s ibm was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the ibm 2250 graphics terminal the first commercially available graphics computer pong arcade version ralph baer a supervising engineer at sanders associates came up with a home video game in 1966 that was later licensed to magnavox and called the odyssey while very simplistic and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen it was the first consumer computer graphics product david c evans was director of engineering at bendix corporation s computer division from 1953 to 1962 after which he worked for the next five years as a visiting professor at berkeley there he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people in 1966 the university of utah recruited evans to form a computer science program and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest this new department would become the world s primary research center for computer graphics also in 1966 sutherland at mit invented the first computer controlled head mounted display hmd called the sword of damocles because of the hardware required for support it displayed two separate wireframe images one for each eye this allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in stereoscopic 3d after receiving his ph d from mit sutherland became director of information processing at arpa advanced research projects agency and later became a professor at harvard in 1967 sutherland was recruited by evans to join the computer science program at the university of utah there he perfected his hmd twenty years later nasa would re discover his techniques in their virtual reality research at utah sutherland and evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company in 1969 the acm initiated a special interest group in graphics siggraph which organizes conferences graphics standards and publications within the field of computer graphics in 1973 the first annual siggraph conference was held which has become one of the focuses of the organization siggraph has grown in size and importance as the field of computer graphics has expanded over time edit 1970s many of the most important early breakthroughs in computer graphics research occurred at the university of utah in the 1970s a student by the name of edwin catmull started at the university of utah in 1970 and signed up for sutherland s computer graphics class catmull had just come from the boeing company and had been working on his degree in physics growing up on disney catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not have the talent for drawing now catmull along with many others saw computers as the natural progression of animation and they wanted to be part of the revolution the first animation that catmull saw was his own he created an animation of his hand opening and closing it became one of his goals to produce a feature length motion picture using computer graphics in the same class fred parke created an animation of his wife s face because of evan s and sutherland s presence uu was gaining quite a reputation as the place to be for computer graphics research so catmull went there to learn 3d animation as the uu computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all over john warnock was one of those early pioneers he would later found adobe systems and create a revolution in the publishing world with his postscript page description language tom stockham led the image processing group at uu which worked closely with the computer graphics lab jim clark was also there he would later found silicon graphics inc the first major advance in 3d computer graphics was created at uu by these early pioneers the hidden surface algorithm in order to draw a representation of a 3d object on the screen the computer must determine which surfaces are behind the object from the viewer s perspective and thus should be hidden when the computer creates or renders the image the 3d core graphics system or core was the first graphical standard to be developed a group of 25 experts of the acm special interest group siggraph developed this conceptual framework the specifications were published in 1977 and it became a foundation for many future development in the field edit 1980s in the early 1980s the availability of bit slice and 16 bit microprocessors started to revolutionise high resolution computer graphics terminals which now increasingly became intelligent semi standalone and standalone workstations graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and mini computers typical of the early move to high resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer aided engineering market were the orca 1000 2000 and 3000 workstations developed by orcatech of ottawa a spin off from bell northern research and led by an early workstation pioneer david john pearson the orca 3000 was based on motorola 68000 and amd bit slice processors and had unix as its operating system it was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector artists and graphic designers began to see the personal computer particularly the commodore amiga and macintosh as a serious design tool one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods in the late 1980s sgi computers were used to create some of the first fully computer generated short films at pixar the macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses modern computers dating from the 1980s often use graphical user interfaces gui to present data and information with symbols icons and pictures rather than text graphics are one of the five key elements of multimedia technology edit 1990s 3d graphics became more popular in the 1990s in gaming multimedia and animation at the end of the 80s and beginning of the nineties were created in france the very first computer graphics tv series la vie des b tes by studio mac guff ligne 1988 les fables g om triques j y grall georges lacroix and renato studio fantome 1990 1993 and quarxs the first hdtv computer graphics series by maurice benayoun and fran ois schuiten studio z a production 1991 1993 in 1995 toy story the first full length computer generated animation film was released in cinemas worldwide in 1996 quake one of the first fully 3d games was released since then computer graphics have only become more detailed and realistic due to more powerful graphics hardware and 3d modeling software edit 2000s this section requires expansion october 2012 computer graphics used in films and video games gradually began to be realistic to the point of entering the uncanny valley examples include the later final fantasy games and animated films like the polar express edit 2010s this section is empty you can help by adding to it october 2012 some increase in use of voxel style graphics along with minecraft s success edit image types edit two dimensional raster graphic sprites left and masks right 2d computer graphics are the computer based generation of digital images mostly from two dimensional models such as 2d geometric models text and digital images and by techniques specific to them 2d computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional printing and drawing technologies such as typography cartography technical drawing advertising etc in those applications the two dimensional image is not just a representation of a real world object but an independent artifact with added semantic value two dimensional models are therefore preferred because they give more direct control of the image than 3d computer graphics whose approach is more akin to photography than to typography edit pixel art pixel art is a form of digital art created through the use of raster graphics software where images are edited on the pixel level graphics in most old or relatively limited computer and video games graphing calculator games and many mobile phone games are mostly pixel art edit vector graphics example showing effect of vector graphics versus raster bitmap graphics vector graphics formats are complementary to raster graphics raster graphics is the representation of images as an array of pixels and is typically used for the representation of photographic images 6 vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image which can allow for more flexibility in rendering there are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice there are times when both formats come together an understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology and the relationship between them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools edit three dimensional 3d computer graphics in contrast to 2d computer graphics are graphics that use a three dimensional representation of geometric data that is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering 2d images such images may be for later display or for real time viewing despite these differences 3d computer graphics rely on many of the same algorithms as 2d computer vector graphics in the wire frame model and 2d computer raster graphics in the final rendered display in computer graphics software the distinction between 2d and 3d is occasionally blurred 2d applications may use 3d techniques to achieve effects such as lighting and primarily 3d may use 2d rendering techniques 3d computer graphics are often referred to as 3d models apart from the rendered graphic the model is contained within the graphical data file however there are differences a 3d model is the mathematical representation of any three dimensional object a model is not technically a graphic until it is visually displayed due to 3d printing 3d models are not confined to virtual space a model can be displayed visually as a two dimensional image through a process called 3d rendering or used in non graphical computer simulations and calculations there are some 3d computer graphics software for users to create 3d images e g autocad photoshop solidwork google sketchup etc edit computer animation example of computer animation produced using motion capture fractal landscape an example of computer generated imagery computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers it is a subfield of computer graphics and animation increasingly it is created by means of 3d computer graphics though 2d computer graphics are still widely used for stylistic low bandwidth and faster real time rendering needs sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself but sometimes the target is another medium such as film it is also referred to as cgi computer generated imagery or computer generated imaging especially when used in films virtual entities may contain and be controlled by assorted attributes such as transform values location orientation and scale stored in an object s transformation matrix animation is the change of an attribute over time multiple methods of achieving animation exist the rudimentary form is based on the creation and editing of keyframes each storing a value at a given time per attribute to be animated the 2d 3d graphics software will interpolate between keyframes creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time resulting in animation other methods of animation include procedural and expression based techniques the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes useful for creating particle effects and crowd simulations the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user defined logical expression coupled with mathematics to automate animation in a predictable way convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a hierarchy offers in skeletal system set up to create the illusion of movement an image is displayed on the computer screen then quickly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image but shifted slightly this technique is identical to the illusion of movement in television and motion pictures edit concepts and principles images are typically produced by optical devices such as cameras mirrors lenses telescopes microscopes etc and natural objects and phenomena such as the human eye or water surfaces a digital image is a representation of a two dimensional image in binary format as a sequence of ones and zeros digital images include both vector images and raster images but raster images are more commonly used edit pixel in the enlarged portion of the image individual pixels are rendered as squares and can be easily seen in digital imaging a pixel or picture element 7 is a single point in a raster image pixels are normally arranged in a regular 2 dimensional grid and are often represented using dots or squares each pixel is a sample of an original image where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original the intensity of each pixel is variable in color systems each pixel has typically three components such as red green and blue edit graphics graphics are visual presentations on some surface such as a wall canvas computer screen paper or stone to brand inform illustrate or entertain examples are photographs drawings line art graphs diagrams typography numbers symbols geometric designs maps engineering drawings or other images graphics often combine text illustration and color graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection creation or arrangement of typography alone as in a brochure flier poster web site or book without any other element clarity or effective communication may be the objective association with other cultural elements may be sought or merely the creation of a distinctive style edit rendering rendering is the process of generating an image from a model or models in what collectively could be called a scene file by means of computer programs a scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure it would contain geometry viewpoint texture lighting and shading information as a description of the virtual scene the data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster graphics image file the rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software though others are available as plug ins or entirely separate programs the term rendering may be by analogy with an artist s rendering of a scene though the technical details of rendering methods vary the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2d image from a 3d representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the graphics pipeline along a rendering device such as a gpu a gpu is a purpose built device able to assist a cpu in performing complex rendering calculations if a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting the rendering software should solve the rendering equation the rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena but is a general lighting model for computer generated imagery rendering is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output 3d projection 3d projection is a method of mapping three dimensional points to a two dimensional plane as most current methods for displaying graphical data are based on planar two dimensional media the use of this type of projection is widespread especially in computer graphics engineering and drafting ray tracing ray tracing is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane the technique is capable of producing a very high degree of photorealism usually higher than that of typical scanline rendering methods but at a greater computational cost shading example of shading shading refers to depicting depth in 3d models or illustrations by varying levels of darkness it is a process used in drawing for depicting levels of darkness on paper by applying media more densely or with a darker shade for darker areas and less densely or with a lighter shade for lighter areas there are various techniques of shading including cross hatching where perpendicular lines of varying closeness are drawn in a grid pattern to shade an area the closer the lines are together the darker the area appears likewise the farther apart the lines are the lighter the area appears the term has been recently generalized to mean that shaders are applied texture mapping texture mapping is a method for adding detail surface texture or colour to a computer generated graphic or 3d model its application to 3d graphics was pioneered by dr edwin catmull in 1974 a texture map is applied mapped to the surface of a shape or polygon this process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon 8 procedural textures created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture and bitmap textures created in an image editing application or imported from a digital camera are generally speaking common methods of implementing texture definition on 3d models in computer graphics software while intended placement of textures onto a model s surface often requires a technique known as uv mapping arbitrary manual layout of texture coordinates for polygon surfaces while nurbs surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used as texture coordinates anti aliasing rendering resolution independent entities such as 3d models for viewing on a raster pixel based device such as a lcd display or crt television inevitably causes aliasing artifacts mostly along geometric edges and the boundaries of texture details these artifacts are informally called jaggies anti aliasing methods rectify such problems resulting in imagery more pleasing to the viewer but can be somewhat computationally expensive various anti aliasing algorithms such as supersampling are able to be employed then customized for the most efficient rendering performance versus quality of the resultant imagery a graphics artist should consider this trade off if anti aliasing methods are to be used a pre anti aliased bitmap texture being displayed on a screen or screen location at a resolution different than the resolution of the texture itself such as a textured model in the distance from the virtual camera will exhibit aliasing artifacts while any procedurally defined texture will always show aliasing artifacts as they are resolution independent techniques such as mipmapping and texture filtering help to solve texture related aliasing problems edit volume rendering volume rendered ct scan of a forearm with different colour schemes for muscle fat bone and blood volume rendering is a technique used to display a 2d projection of a 3d discretely sampled data set a typical 3d data set is a group of 2d slice images acquired by a ct or mri scanner usually these are acquired in a regular pattern e g one slice every millimeter and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern this is an example of a regular volumetric grid with each volume element or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel edit 3d modeling 3d modeling is the process of developing a mathematical wireframe representation of any three dimensional object called a 3d model via specialized software models may be created automatically or manually the manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3d computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting 3d models may be created using multiple approaches use of nurbs curves to generate accurate and smooth surface patches polygonal mesh modeling manipulation of faceted geometry or polygonal mesh subdivision advanced tessellation of polygons resulting in smooth surfaces similar to nurbs models a 3d model can be displayed as a two dimensional image through a process called 3d rendering used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena or animated directly for other purposes the model can also be physically created using 3d printing devices edit pioneers in graphic design charles csuri charles csuri is a pioneer in computer animation and digital fine art and created the first computer

dimensional computer graphics it also encompasses two dimensional graphics and image processing as an academic discipline computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques it focuses on the mathematical and computational foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely aesthetic issues computer graphics is often
