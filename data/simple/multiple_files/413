in computer science an online algorithm is one that can process its input piece by piece in a serial fashion i e in the order that the input is fed to the algorithm without having the entire input available from the start in contrast an offline algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output an answer which solves the problem at hand for example selection sort requires that the entire list be given before it can sort it while insertion sort doesn t because it does not know the whole input an online algorithm is forced to make decisions that may later turn out not to be optimal and the study of online algorithms has focused on the quality of decision making that is possible in this setting competitive analysis formalizes this idea by comparing the relative performance of an online and offline algorithm for the same problem instance for other points of view on online inputs to algorithms see streaming algorithm focusing on the amount of memory needed to accurately represent past inputs dynamic algorithm focusing on the time complexity of maintaining solutions to problems with online inputs and online machine learning a problem exemplifying the concepts of online algorithms is the canadian traveller problem the goal of this problem is to minimize the cost of reaching a target in a weighted graph where some of the edges are unreliable and may have been removed from the graph however that an edge has been removed failed is only revealed to the traveller when she he reaches one of the edge s endpoints the worst case for this problem is simply that all of the unreliable edges fail and the problem reduces to the usual shortest path problem an alternative analysis of the problem can be made with the help of competitive analysis for this method of analysis the offline algorithm knows in advance which edges will fail and the goal is to minimize the ratio between the online and offline algorithms performance this problem is pspace complete contents 1 online algorithms 2 see also 3 references 4 external links edit online algorithms the names below are referenced with capital letters since they appear in papers with capital letters the following are the names of some online algorithms algorithms for the k server problem balance2 balance slack double coverage equipoise handicap harmonic random slack tight span algorithm tree algorithm work function algorithm wfa edit see also greedy algorithm adversary model job shop scheduling list update problem metrical task systems odds algorithm paging problem real time computing secretary problem ski rental problem linear search problem search games algorithms for calculating variance bandit problem ukkonen s algorithm edit references borodin a el yaniv r 1998 online computation and competitive analysis cambridge university press isbn 160 0 521 56392 5 http www cs technion ac il rani book html edit external links bibliography of papers on online algorithms this computer science article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e
