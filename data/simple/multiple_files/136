the 1980s in the form of executive information systems eiss due to problems primarily with data refreshing and handling it was soon realized that the approach wasn t practical as information was often incomplete unreliable and spread across too many disparate sources 4 thus eiss hibernated until the 1990s when the information age quickened pace and data warehousing and online analytical processing olap allowed dashboards to function adequately despite the availability of enabling technologies the rapid rise in dashboard use didn t become popular until later in that decade primarily due to the rise of key performance indicators kpis introduced by robert s kaplan and david p norton as the balanced scorecard 5 today the use of dashboards forms an important part of business performance

view of a measure s performance each of these sections ensures that a balanced scorecard is essentially connected to the businesses critical strategic needs the design of a dashboard is more loosely defined dashboards are usually a series of graphics charts gauges and other visual indicators that can be monitored and interpreted even when there is a strategic link on a dashboard it may not be noticed as such since objectives are not normally present on dashboards however dashboards can be customized to link their graphs and charts to strategic objectives 7 edit design this section contains
