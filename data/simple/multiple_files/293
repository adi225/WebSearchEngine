technology also referred to as it is the application of computers and telecommunications equipment to store retrieve transmit and manipulate data 1 often in the context of a business or other enterprise 2 the term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones 3 several industries are associated with information technology such as computer hardware software electronics semiconductors internet telecom equipment e commerce and computer services 3 in the business context the information technology association of america has defined information technology it as the study design development application implementation support or management of computer based information systems 4 the business value of information technology is to automate business processes provide information for decision making connect business with their customers and provide productivity tools to increase efficiency in an academic context the association for computing machinery defines it as undergraduate degree programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of business government healthcare schools and other kinds of organizations 160 it specialists assume responsibility for selecting hardware and software products appropriate for an organization integrating those products with organizational needs and infrastructure and installing customizing and maintaining those applications for the organization s computer users examples of these responsibilities include the installation of networks network administration and security the design of web pages the development of multimedia resources the installation of communication components the oversight of email systems and the planning and management of the technology lifecycle by which an organization s technology is maintained upgraded and replaced 5 humans have been storing retrieving manipulating and communicating information since the sumerians in mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 160 bc 6 but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the harvard business review authors leavitt and whisler commented that the new technology does not yet have a single established name we shall call it information technology it 7 based on the storage and processing technology employed it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of it development pre mechanical 3000 160 bc 160 1450 160 ad mechanical 1450 1840 electromechanical 1840 1940 and electronic 1940 present 6 this article focuses on the most recent period electronic which began around the year 1940 contents 1 history of

history of computers main article history of computing hardware devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years probably initially in the form of a tally stick 8 the antikythera mechanism dating from about the beginning of the first century bc is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer it is also the earliest known geared mechanism 9 comparable geared devices did not emerge in europe until the 16th century 10 and it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed 11 electronic computers using either relays or valves began to appear in the early 1940s the electromechanical zuse z3 completed in 1941 was the world s first programmable computer and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete computing machine colossus developed during the second world war to decrypt german messages was the first electronic digital computer although it was programmable it was not general purpose being designed to perform only a single task it also lacked the ability to store its program in memory instead programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring 12 the first recognisably modern electronic digital stored program computer was the manchester small scale experimental machine ssem which ran its first program on 21 june 1948 13 edit data storage main article data storage device early electronic computers such as colossus made use of punched tape a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes a technology now obsolete 14 electronic data storage which is used in modern computers dates from the second world war when a form of delay line memory was developed to remove the clutter from radar signals the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line 15 the first random access digital storage device was the williams tube based on a standard cathode ray tube 16 but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed and thus was lost once power was removed the earliest form of non volatile computer storage was the magnetic drum invented in 1932 17 and used in the ferranti mark 1 the world s first commercially available general purpose electronic computer 18 most digital data today is still stored magnetically on devices such as hard disk drives or optically on media such as cd roms 19 it has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than 3 exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007 20 doubling roughly every 3 160 years 21 edit databases main article database management system database management systems emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly one of the earliest such systems was ibm s information management system ims 22 which is still widely deployed more than 40 years later 23 ims stores data hierarchically 22 but in the 1970s ted codd proposed an alternative relational storage model based on set theory and predicate logic and the familiar concepts of tables rows and columns the first commercially available relational database management system rdbms was available from oracle in 1980 24 all database management systems consist of a number of components that together allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while maintaining its integrity a characteristic of all databases is that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself in a database schema 22 the extensible markup language xml has become a popular format for data representation in recent years although xml data can be stored in normal file systems it is commonly held in relational databases to take advantage of their robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort 25 as an evolution of the standard generalized markup language sgml xml s text based structure offers the advantage of being both machine and human readable 26 edit data retrieval the relational database model introduced a programming language independent of structured query language sql based on relational algebra 24 the terms data and information are not synonymous anything stored is data but it only becomes information when it is organised and presented meaningfully 27 most of the world s digital data is unstructured and stored in a variety of different physical formats 28 a even within a single organization data warehouses began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores they typically contain data extracted from various sources including external sources such as the internet organised in such a way as to facilitate decision support systems dss 29 edit data transmission data transmission has three aspects transmission propagation and reception 30 xml has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early 2000s 31 particularly for machine oriented interactions such as those involved in web oriented protocols such as soap 26 describing data in transit rather than 160 data at rest 31 one of the challenges of such usage is converting data from relational databases into xml document object model dom structures 32 edit data manipulation hilbert and lopez 20 identify the exponential pace of technological change a kind of moore s law machines application specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007 the per capita capacity of the world s general purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months the world s storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double every 3 years and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12 3 years 20 massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day but unless it can be analysed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been called data tombs data archives that are seldom visited 33 to address that issue the field of data mining 160 the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data 34 160 emerged in the late 1980s 35 edit commercial perspective worldwide it spending forecast 36 billions of u s dollars category 2012 spending 2013 spending devices 627 666 data center systems

mathematician norbert wiener in the 1940s 37 some of the ethical issues associated with the use of information technology include 38 breaches of copyright by those downloading files stored without the permission of the copyright holders employers monitoring their employees emails and other internet usage unsolicited emails hackers accessing online databases web sites installing cookies or spyware
