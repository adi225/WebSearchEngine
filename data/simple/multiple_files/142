not to be confused with sanitization classified information it has been suggested that cleansing and conforming data be merged into this article or section discuss proposed since may 2012 data cleansing data cleaning or data scrubbing is the process of detecting and correcting or removing corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set table or database used mainly in databases the term refers to identifying incomplete incorrect inaccurate irrelevant etc parts of the data and then replacing modifying or deleting this dirty data after cleansing a data set will be consistent with other similar data sets in the system the inconsistencies detected or removed may have been originally caused by user entry errors by corruption in transmission or storage or by different data dictionary definitions of similar entities in different stores data cleansing differs from data validation in that validation almost invariably means data is rejected from the system at entry and is performed at entry time rather than on batches of data the actual process of data cleansing may involve removing typographical errors or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities the validation may be strict such as rejecting any address that does not have a valid postal code or fuzzy such as correcting records that partially match existing known records some data cleansing solutions will clean data by cross checking with a validated data set also data enhancement where data is made more complete by adding related information is a common data cleansing practice for example appending addresses with phone numbers related to that address data cleansing may also involve activities like harmonization of data and standardization of data for example harmonization of short codes st rd etc to actual words street road standardization of data is a means changing of reference data set to a new standard ex use of standard codes contents 1 motivation 2 data quality 3

lead to false conclusions and misdirected investments on both public and private scales for instance the government may want to analyze population census figures to decide which regions require further spending and investment on infrastructure and services in this case it will be important to have access to reliable data to avoid erroneous fiscal decisions in the business world incorrect data can be costly many companies use customer information databases that record data like contact information addresses and preferences for instance if the addresses are inconsistent the company will suffer the cost of resending mail or even losing customers there are packages available so you can cleanse wash address data while you enter it into your system this is normally done via an api and will prompt staff as they type the address edit data quality high quality data needs to pass a set of quality criteria those include validity the degree to which the measures conform to defined business rules or constraints see also validity statistics when modern database technology is used to design data capture systems validity is fairly easy to ensure invalid data arises mainly in legacy contexts where constraints were not implemented in software or where inappropriate data capture technology was used e g spreadsheets where it is very hard to limit what a user chooses to enter into a cell data constraints fall into the following categories data type constraints e g values in a particular column must be of a particular datatype e g boolean numeric integer or real date etc range constraints typically numbers or dates should fall within a certain range that is they have minimum and or maximum permissible values mandatory constraints certain columns cannot be empty unique constraints a field or a combination of fields must be unique across a dataset for example no two persons can have the same social security number set membership constraints the values for a column come from a set of discrete values or codes for example a person s gender may be female male or unknown not recorded foreign key constraints this is the more general case of set membership the set of values in a column is defined in a column of another table that contains unique values for example in a us taxpayer database the state column is required to belong to one of the us s defined states or territories the set of permissible states territories is recorded in a separate states table the term foreign key is borrowed from relational database terminology follow the hyperlink for more details regular expression patterns occasionally text fields will have to be validated this way for example phone numbers may be required to have the pattern 999 999 9999 cross field validation certain conditions that utilize multiple fields must hold for example in laboratory medicine the sum of the components of the differential white blood cell count must be equal to 100 since they are all percentages in a hospital database a patient s date of discharge from hospital cannot be earlier than the date of admission accuracy the degree of conformity of a measure to a standard or a true value see also accuracy and precision accuracy is very hard to achieve through data cleansing in the general case because it requires accessing an external source of data that contains the true value such gold standard data is often unavailable accuracy has been achieved in some cleansing contexts notably customer contact data by using external databases that match up zip codes to geographical locations city and state and also help verify that street addresses within these zip codes actually exist completeness the degree to which all required measures are known see also completeness incompleteness is almost impossible to fix with data cleansing methodology one cannot infer facts that were not captured when the data in question was initially recorded in some contexts e g interview data it may be possible to fix incompleteness by going back to the original source of data i e re interviewing the subject but even this does not guarantee success because of problems of recall e g in an interview to gather data on food consumption no one is likely to remember exactly what one ate six months ago in the case of systems that insist certain columns should not be empty one may work around the problem by designating a value that indicates unknown or missing but supplying of default values does not imply that the data has been made complete consistency the degree to which a set of measures are equivalent in across systems see also consistency inconsistency occurs when two data items in the data set contradict each other e g a customer is recorded in two different systems as having two different current addresses and only one of them can be correct fixing inconsistency is not always possible it requires a variety of strategies e g deciding which data were recorded more recently which data source is likely to be most reliable the latter knowledge may be specific to a given organization or simply trying to find the truth by testing both data items e g calling up the customer uniformity the degree to which a set data measures are specified using the same units of measure in all systems see also unit of measure in datasets pooled from different locales weight may be recorded either in pounds or kilos and must be converted to a single measure using an arithmetic transformation the term integrity encompasses accuracy consistency and some aspects of validation see also data integrity but is rarely used by itself in data cleansing contexts because it is insufficiently specific for example referential integrity is a term used to refer to the enforcement of foreign key constraints above edit the process of data cleansing data auditing the data is audited with the use of statistical and database methods to detect anomalies and contradictions this eventually gives an indication of the characteristics of the anomalies and their locations several commercial software packages will let you specify constraints of various kinds using a grammar that conforms to that of a standard programming language e g javascript of visual basic and then generate code that checks the data for violation of these constraints this process is referred to below in the bullets workflow specification and workflow execution for users who lack access to high end cleansing software microcomputer database packages such as microsoft access or filemaker pro will also let you perform such checks on a constraint by constraint basis interactively with little or no programming required in many cases workflow specification the detection and removal of anomalies is performed by a sequence of operations on the data known as the workflow it is specified after the process of auditing the data and is crucial in achieving the end product of high quality data in order to achieve a proper workflow the causes of the anomalies and errors in the data have to be closely considered workflow execution in this stage the workflow is executed after its specification is complete and its correctness is verified the implementation of the workflow should be efficient even on large sets of data which inevitably poses a trade off because the execution of a data cleansing operation can be computationally expensive post processing and controlling after executing the cleansing workflow the results are inspected to verify correctness data that could not be corrected during execution of the workflow is manually corrected if possible the result is a new cycle in the data cleansing process where the data is audited again to allow the specification of an additional workflow to further cleanse the data by automatic processing edit popular methods used parsing parsing in data cleansing is performed for the detection of syntax errors a parser decides whether a string of data is acceptable within the allowed data specification this is similar to the way a parser works with grammars and languages data transformation data transformation allows the mapping of the data from its given format into the format expected by the appropriate application this includes value conversions or translation functions as well as normalizing numeric values to conform to minimum and maximum values duplicate elimination duplicate detection requires an algorithm for determining whether data contains duplicate representations of the same entity usually data is sorted by a key that would bring duplicate entries closer together for faster identification statistical methods by analyzing the data using the values of mean standard deviation range or clustering algorithms it is possible for an expert to find values that are unexpected and thus erroneous although the correction of such data is difficult since the true value is not known it can be resolved by setting the values to an average or other statistical value statistical methods can also be used to handle missing values which can be replaced by one or more plausible values which are usually obtained by extensive data augmentation algorithms edit challenges and problems error correction and loss of information the most challenging problem within data cleansing remains the correction of values to remove duplicates and invalid entries in many cases the available information on such anomalies is limited and insufficient to determine the necessary transformations or corrections leaving the deletion of such entries as the only plausible solution the deletion of data though leads to loss of information this loss can be particularly costly if there is a large amount of deleted data maintenance of cleansed data data cleansing is an expensive and time consuming process so after having performed data cleansing and achieving a data collection free of errors one would want to avoid the re cleansing of data in its entirety after some values in data collection change the process should only be repeated on values that have changed this means that a cleansing lineage would need to be kept which would require efficient data collection and management techniques data cleansing in virtually integrated environments in virtually integrated sources like ibm s discoverylink the cleansing of data has to be performed every time the data is accessed which considerably decreases the response time and efficiency data cleansing framework in many cases it will not be possible to derive a complete data cleansing graph to guide the process in advance this makes data cleansing an iterative process involving significant exploration and interaction which may require a framework in the form of a collection of methods for error detection and elimination in addition to data auditing this can be integrated with other data processing stages like integration and maintenance edit see
