2010 a ranking is a relationship between a set of items such that for any two items the first is either ranked higher than ranked lower than or ranked equal to the second in mathematics this is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects it is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking the rankings themselves are totally ordered for example materials are totally preordered by hardness while degrees of hardness are totally ordered by reducing detailed measures to a sequence of ordinal numbers rankings make it possible to evaluate complex information according to certain criteria thus for example an internet search engine may rank the pages it finds according to an estimation of their relevance making it possible for the user quickly to select the pages they are likely to want to see analysis of data obtained by ranking commonly requires non parametric statistics contents 1 strategies for assigning rankings 1 1 standard

by verifying the claims made and adding references statements consisting only of original research may be removed july 2008 it is not always possible to assign rankings uniquely for example in a race or competition two or more entrants might tie for a place in the ranking when computing an ordinal measurement two or more of the quantities being ranked might measure equal in these cases one of the strategies shown below for assigning the rankings may be adopted a common shorthand way to distinguish these ranking strategies is by the ranking numbers that would be produced for four items with the first item ranked ahead of the second and third which compare equal which are both ranked ahead of the fourth these names are also shown below edit standard competition ranking 1224 ranking in competition ranking items that compare equal receive the same ranking number and then a gap is left in the ranking numbers the number of ranking numbers that are left out in this gap is one less than the number of items that compared equal equivalently each item s ranking number is 1 plus the number of items ranked above it this ranking strategy is frequently adopted for competitions as it means that if two or more competitors tie for a position in the ranking the position of all those ranked below them is unaffected i e a competitor only comes second if exactly one person scores better than them third if exactly two people score better than them fourth if exactly three people score better than them etc thus if a ranks ahead of b and c which compare equal which are both ranked ahead of d then a gets ranking number 1 first b gets ranking number 2 joint second c also gets ranking number 2 joint second and d gets ranking number 4 fourth in this case nobody would get ranking number 3 third and that would be left as a gap edit modified competition ranking 1334 ranking sometimes competition ranking is done by leaving the gaps in the ranking numbers before the sets of equal ranking items rather than after them as in standard competition ranking the number of ranking numbers that are left out in this gap remains one less than the number of items that compared equal equivalently each item s ranking number is equal to the number of items ranked equal to it or above it this ranking ensures that a competitor only comes second if they score higher than all but one of their opponents third if they score higher than all but two of their opponents etc thus if a ranks ahead of b and c which compare equal which are both ranked ahead of d then a gets ranking number 1 first b gets ranking number 3 joint third c also gets ranking number 3 joint third and d gets ranking number 4 fourth in this case nobody would get ranking number 2 second and that would be left as a gap edit dense ranking 1223 ranking in dense ranking items that compare equal receive the same ranking number and the next item s receive the immediately following ranking number equivalently each item s ranking number is 1 plus the number of items ranked above it that are distinct with respect to the ranking order thus if a ranks ahead of b and c which compare equal which are both ranked ahead of d then a gets ranking number 1 first b gets ranking number 2 joint second c also gets ranking number 2 joint second and d gets ranking number 3 third edit ordinal ranking 1234 ranking in ordinal ranking all items receive distinct ordinal numbers including items that compare equal the assignment of distinct ordinal numbers to items that compare equal can be done at random or arbitrarily but it is generally preferable to use a system that is arbitrary but consistent as this gives stable results if the ranking is done multiple times an example of an arbitrary but consistent system would be to incorporate other attributes into the ranking order such as alphabetical ordering of the competitor s name to ensure that no two items exactly match with this strategy if a ranks ahead of b and c which compare equal which are both ranked ahead of d then a gets ranking number 1 first and d gets ranking number 4 fourth and either b gets ranking number 2 second and c gets ranking number 3 third or c gets ranking number 2 second and b gets ranking number 3 third in computer data processing ordinal ranking is also referred to as row numbering edit fractional ranking 1 2 5 2 5 4 ranking items that compare equal receive the same ranking number which is the mean of what they would have under ordinal rankings equivalently the ranking number of 1 plus the number of items ranked above it plus half the number of items equal to it this strategy has the property that the sum of the ranking numbers is the same as under ordinal ranking for this reason it is used in computing borda counts and in statistical tests see below thus if a ranks ahead of b and c which compare equal which are both ranked ahead of d then a gets ranking number 1 first b and c each get ranking number 2 5 average of joint second third and d gets ranking number 4 fourth edit ranking in statistics in statistics ranking refers to the data transformation in which numerical or ordinal values are replaced by their rank when the data are sorted for example the numerical data 3 4 5 1 2 6 7 3 are observed the ranks of these data items would be 2 3 1 and 4 respectively for example the ordinal data hot cold warm would be replaced by 3 1 2 in these examples the ranks are assigned to values in ascending order in some other cases descending ranks are used ranks are related to the indexed list of order statistics which consists of the original dataset rearranged into ascending order some kinds of statistical tests employ calculations based on ranks examples include friedman test kruskal wallis test rank products spearman s rank correlation coefficient wilcoxon rank sum test wilcoxon signed rank test some ranks can have non integer values for tied data values for example when there is an even number of copies of the same data value the above described fractional statistical rank of the tied data ends in edit rank function in excel the rank function in microsoft excel assigns competition ranks 1224 as described above for some statistical purposes that is not the desired result for instance it means that the sum of ranks for a list of a given length changes depending on the number of ties pottel has described a user defined ranking function which assigns fractional ranks to ties to keep the sum consistent 1 edit examples of ranking this section does not cite any references or sources please help

its seniority in the company s capital structure for instance capital notes are subordinated securities they would rank behind senior debt in a wind up in other words the holders of senior debt would be paid out before subordinated debt holders received any funds search engines rank web pages by their expected relevance to a user s query using a combination of query dependent and query independent methods query independent methods attempt to measure the estimated importance of a page independent of any consideration of how well it matches the specific query query independent ranking is usually based on link analysis examples include the hits algorithm pagerank and trustrank query dependent methods attempt to measure the degree to which a page matches a specific query independent of the importance of the page query dependent ranking is usually based on heuristics that consider the number and locations of matches of the various query words on the page itself in the url or in any

a piece of text in language the status of an item usually through what is known as downranking or rank shifting in relation to the uppermost rank in a clause for example in the sentence i want to eat the cake you made today eat is on the uppermost rank but made is downranked as part of the nominal group the cake you made today this nominal group behaves as though it were a single noun i e i want to eat it and thus the verb within it made is ranked differently from eat academic journals are sometimes ranked according to impact factor the number of later articles that cite articles in a given
