ai redirects here for other uses see ai for other uses see artificial intelligence disambiguation artificial intelligence ai is the intelligence of machines and robots and the branch of computer science that aims to create it ai textbooks define the field as the study and design of intelligent agents 1 where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success 2 john mccarthy who coined the term in 1955 3 defines it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines 4 ai research is highly technical and specialised deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other 5 some of the division is due to social and cultural factors subfields have grown up around particular institutions and the work of individual researchers ai research is also divided by several technical issues there are subfields which are focused on the solution of specific problems on one of several possible approaches on the use of widely differing tools and towards the accomplishment of particular applications the central problems of ai include such traits as reasoning knowledge planning learning communication perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects 6 general intelligence or strong ai is still among the field s long term goals 7 currently popular approaches include statistical methods computational intelligence and traditional symbolic ai there are an enormous number of tools used in ai including versions of search and mathematical optimization logic methods based on probability and economics and many others the field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans intelligence the sapience of homo sapiens can be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine 8 this raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings issues which have been addressed by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity 9 artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimism 10 but has also suffered setbacks 11 today it has become an essential part of the technology industry providing

intelligence and timeline of artificial intelligence thinking machines and artificial beings appear in greek myths such as talos of crete the bronze robot of hephaestus and pygmalion s galatea 13 human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every major civilization animated cult images were worshiped in egypt and greece 14 and humanoid automatons were built by yan shi hero of alexandria and al jazari 15 it was also widely believed that artificial beings had been created by j bir ibn hayy n judah loew and paracelsus 16 by the 19th and 20th centuries artificial beings had become a common feature in fiction as in mary shelley s frankenstein or karel apek s r u r rossum s universal robots 17 pamela mccorduck argues that all of these are examples of an ancient urge as she describes it to forge the gods 9 stories of these creatures and their fates discuss many of the same hopes fears and ethical concerns that are presented by artificial intelligence mechanical or formal reasoning has been developed by philosophers and mathematicians since antiquity the study of logic led directly to the invention of the programmable digital electronic computer based on the work of mathematician alan turing and others turing s theory of computation suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable imaginable act of mathematical deduction 18 19 this along with concurrent discoveries in neurology information theory and cybernetics inspired a small group of researchers to begin to seriously consider the possibility of building an electronic brain 20 the field of ai research was founded at a conference on the campus of dartmouth college in the summer of 1956 21 the attendees including john mccarthy marvin minsky allen newell and herbert simon became the leaders of ai research for many decades 22 they and their students wrote programs that were to most people simply astonishing 23 computers were solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english 24 by the middle of the 1960s research in the u s was heavily funded by the department of defense 25 and laboratories had been established around the world 26 ai s founders were profoundly optimistic about the future of the new field herbert simon predicted that machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do and marvin minsky agreed writing that within a generation 160 the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved 27 they had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced 28 in 1974 in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects both the u s and british governments cut off all undirected exploratory research in ai the next few years when funding for projects was hard to find would later be called the ai winter 29 in the early 1980s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems 30 a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts by 1985 the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japan s fifth generation computer project inspired the u s and british governments to restore funding for academic research in the field 31 however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987 ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longer lasting ai winter began 32 in the 1990s and early 21st century ai achieved its greatest successes albeit somewhat behind the scenes artificial intelligence is used for logistics data mining medical diagnosis and many other areas throughout the technology industry 12 the success was due to several factors the increasing computational power of computers see moore s law a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems the creation of new ties between ai and other fields working on similar problems and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards 33 on 11 may 1997 deep blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov 34 in 2005 a stanford robot won the darpa grand challenge by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail 35 two years later a team from cmu won the darpa urban challenge when their vehicle autonomously navigated 55 miles in an urban environment while adhering to traffic hazards and all traffic laws 36 in february 2011 in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibm s question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin 37 the kinect which provides a 3d body motion interface for the xbox 360 uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy ai research 38 edit problems the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into a number of specific sub problems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention 6 edit deduction reasoning problem solving early ai researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step by step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions 39 by the late 1980s and 90s ai research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics 40 for difficult problems most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources most experience a combinatorial explosion the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size the search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for ai research 41 human beings solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgements rather than the conscious step by step deduction that early ai research was able to model 42 ai has made some progress at imitating this kind of sub symbolic problem solving embodied agent approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning neural net research attempts to simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise to this skill statistical approaches to ai mimic the probabilistic nature of the human ability to guess edit knowledge representation an ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts main articles knowledge representation and commonsense knowledge knowledge representation 43 and knowledge engineering 44 are central to ai research many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world among the things that ai needs to represent are objects properties categories and relations between objects 45 situations events states and time 46 causes and effects 47 knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know 48 and many other less well researched domains a representation of what exists is an ontology borrowing a word from traditional philosophy of which the most general are called upper ontologies 49 among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are default reasoning and the qualification problem many of the things people know take the form of working assumptions for example if a bird comes up in conversation people typically picture an animal that is fist sized sings and flies none of these things are true about all birds john mccarthy identified this problem in 1969 50 as the qualification problem for any commonsense rule that ai researchers care to represent there tend to be a huge number of exceptions almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires ai research has explored a number of solutions to this problem 51 the breadth of commonsense knowledge the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge e g cyc require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time 52 a major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet and thus be able to add to its own ontology citation needed the subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally for example a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed 53 or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake 54 these are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain non consciously and sub symbolically 55 knowledge like this informs supports and provides a context for symbolic conscious knowledge as with the related problem of sub symbolic reasoning it is hoped that situated ai computational intelligence or statistical ai will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge 55 edit planning a hierarchical control system is a form of control system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy main article automated planning and scheduling intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them 56 they need a way to visualize the future they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it and be able to make choices that maximize the utility or value of the available choices 57 in classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be 58 however if the agent is not the only actor it must periodically ascertain whether the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty 59 multi agent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence 60 edit learning main article machine learning machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience 61 62 it has been central to ai research from the beginning 63 unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression classification is used to determine what category something belongs in after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change in reinforcement learning 64 the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones these can be analyzed in terms of decision theory using concepts like utility the mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory 65 edit natural language processing a parse tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some formal grammar main article natural language processing natural language processing 66 gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages that humans speak a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human written sources such as internet texts some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval or text mining and machine translation 67 a common method of processing and extracting meaning from natural language is through semantic indexing increases in processing speeds and the drop in the cost of data storage makes indexing large volumes of abstractions of the users input much more efficient edit motion and manipulation main article robotics the field of robotics 68 is closely related to ai intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation 69 and navigation with sub problems of localization knowing where you are or finding out where other things are mapping learning what is around you building a map of the environment and motion planning figuring out how to get there or path planning going from one point in space to another point which may involve compliant motion where the robot moves while maintaining physical contact with an object 70 71 edit perception main articles machine perception computer vision and speech recognition machine perception 72 is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones sonar and others more exotic to deduce aspects of the world computer vision 73 is the ability to analyze visual input a few selected subproblems are speech recognition 74 facial recognition and object recognition 75 edit social intelligence main article affective computing kismet a robot with rudimentary social skills 76 affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize interpret process and simulate human affects 77 78 it is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences psychology and cognitive science 79 while the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into emotion 80 the more modern branch of computer science originated with rosalind picard s 1995 paper 81 on affective computing 82 83 a motivation for the research is the ability to simulate empathy the machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behaviour to them giving an appropriate response for those emotions emotion and social skills 84 play two roles for an intelligent agent first it must be able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states this involves elements of game theory decision theory as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions also in an effort to facilitate human computer interaction an intelligent machine might want to be able to display emotions even if it does not actually experience them itself in order to appear sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction edit creativity main article computational creativity a sub field of ai addresses creativity both theoretically from a philosophical and psychological perspective and practically via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative or systems that identify and assess creativity related areas of computational research are artificial intuition and artificial imagination edit general intelligence main articles strong ai and ai complete most researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with general intelligence known as strong ai combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them 7 a few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain may be required for such a project 85 86 many of the problems above are considered ai complete to solve one problem you must solve them all for example even a straightforward specific task like machine translation requires that the machine follow the author s argument reason know what is being talked about knowledge and faithfully reproduce the author s intention social intelligence machine translation therefore is believed to be ai complete it may require strong ai to be done as well as humans can do it 87 edit approaches there is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides ai research researchers disagree about many issues 88 a few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurology or is human biology as irrelevant to ai research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering 89 can intelligent behavior be described using simple elegant principles such as logic or optimization or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems 90 can intelligence be reproduced using high level symbols similar to words and ideas or does it require sub symbolic processing 91 john haugeland who coined the term gofai good old fashioned artificial intelligence also proposed that ai should more properly be referred to as synthetic intelligence 92 a term which has since been adopted by some non gofai researchers 93 94 edit cybernetics and brain simulation main articles cybernetics and computational neuroscience in the 1940s and 1950s a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology information theory and cybernetics some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence such as w grey walter s turtles and the johns hopkins beast many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the teleological society at princeton university and the ratio club in england 20 by 1960 this approach was largely abandoned although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s edit symbolic main article gofai when access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s ai research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation the research was centered in three institutions carnegie mellon university stanford and mit and each one developed its own style of research john haugeland named these approaches to ai good old fashioned ai or gofai 95 during the 1960s symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high level thinking in small demonstration programs approaches based on cybernetics or neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background 96 researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field cognitive simulation economist herbert simon and allen newell studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence as well as cognitive science operations research and management science their research team used the results of psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems this tradition centered at carnegie mellon university would eventually culminate in the development of the soar architecture in the middle 80s 97 98 logic based unlike newell and simon john mccarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving regardless of whether people used the same algorithms 89 his laboratory at stanford sail focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems including knowledge representation planning and learning 99 logic was also the focus of the work at the university of edinburgh and elsewhere in europe which led to the development of the programming language prolog and the science of logic programming 100 anti logic or scruffy researchers at mit such as marvin minsky and seymour papert 101 found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required ad hoc solutions they argued that there was no simple and general principle like logic that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior roger schank described their anti logic approaches as scruffy as opposed to the neat paradigms at cmu and stanford 90 commonsense knowledge bases such as doug lenat s cyc are an example of scruffy ai since they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time 102 knowledge based when computers with large memories became available around 1970 researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into ai applications 103 this knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of expert systems introduced by edward feigenbaum the first truly successful form of ai software 30 the knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple ai applications edit sub symbolic by the 1980s progress in symbolic ai seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition a number of researchers began to look into sub symbolic approaches to specific ai problems 91 bottom up embodied situated behavior based or nouvelle ai researchers from the related field of robotics such as rodney brooks rejected symbolic ai and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive 104 their work revived the non symbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the 50s and reintroduced the use of control theory in ai this coincided with the development of the embodied mind thesis in the related field of cognitive science the idea that aspects of the body such as movement perception and visualization are required for higher intelligence computational intelligence interest in neural networks and connectionism was revived by david rumelhart and others in the middle 1980s 105 these and other sub symbolic approaches such as fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of computational intelligence 106 edit statistical in the 1990s ai researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems these tools are truly scientific in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable and they have been responsible for many of ai s recent successes the shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields like mathematics economics or operations research stuart russell and peter norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats 33 critics argue that these techniques are too focused on particular problems and have failed to address the long term goal of general intelligence 107 there is an ongoing debate about the relevance and validity of statistical approaches in ai exemplified in part by exchanges between peter norvig and noam chomsky as described in 108 109 edit integrating the approaches intelligent agent paradigm an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success the simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems more complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings such as firms the paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful without agreeing on one single approach an agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works some agents are symbolic and logical some are sub symbolic neural networks and others may use new approaches the paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields such as decision theory and economics that also use concepts of abstract agents the intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s 2 agent architectures and cognitive architectures researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents in a multi agent system 110 a system with both symbolic and sub symbolic components is a hybrid intelligent system and the study of such systems is artificial intelligence systems integration a hierarchical control system provides a bridge between sub symbolic ai at its lowest reactive levels and traditional symbolic ai at its highest levels where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling 111 rodney brooks subsumption architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system 112 edit tools in the course of 50 years of research ai has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science a few of the most general of these methods are discussed below edit search and optimization main articles search algorithm mathematical optimization and evolutionary computation many problems in ai can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions 113 reasoning can be reduced to performing a search for example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions where each step is the application of an inference rule 114 planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called means ends analysis 115 robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space 69 many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization simple exhaustive searches 116 are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes the solution for many problems is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal called pruning the search tree heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies 117 a very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s based on the mathematical theory of optimization for many problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing we begin the search at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we reach the top other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing beam search and random optimization 118 evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search for example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses forms of evolutionary computation include swarm intelligence algorithms such as ant colony or particle swarm optimization 119 and evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms gene expression programming and genetic programming 120 edit logic main articles logic programming and automated reasoning logic 121 is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well for example the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning 122 and inductive logic programming is a method for learning 123 several different forms of logic are used in ai research propositional or sentential logic 124 is the logic of statements which can be true or false first order logic 125 also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and their relations with each other fuzzy logic 126 is a version of first order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1 rather than simply true 1 or false 0 fuzzy systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems subjective logic 127 models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy logic a given binomial opinion satisfies belief disbelief uncertainty 1 within a beta distribution by this method ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence default logics non monotonic logics and circumscription 51 are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as description logics 45 situation calculus event calculus and fluent calculus for representing events and time 46 causal calculus 47 belief calculus and modal logics 48 edit probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning main articles bayesian network hidden markov model kalman filter decision theory and utility theory many problems in ai in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics 128 bayesian networks 129 are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm 130 learning using the expectation maximization algorithm 131 planning using decision networks 132 and perception using dynamic bayesian networks 133 probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time e g hidden markov models or kalman filters 133 a key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis 134 information value theory 57 these tools include models such as markov decision processes 135 dynamic decision networks 133 game theory and mechanism design 136 edit classifiers and statistical learning methods main articles classifier mathematics statistical classification and machine learning the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if shiny then pick up controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many ai systems classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match they can be tuned according to examples making them very attractive for use in ai these examples are known as observations or patterns in supervised learning each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class a class can be seen as a decision that has to be made all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience 137 a classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and machine learning approaches the most widely used classifiers are the neural network 138 kernel methods such as the support vector machine 139 k nearest neighbor algorithm 140 gaussian mixture model 141 naive bayes classifier 142 and decision tree 143 the performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified there is no single classifier that works best on all given problems this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science 144 edit neural networks main articles neural network and connectionism a neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain the study of artificial neural networks 138 began in the decade before the field ai research was founded in the work of walter pitts and warren mccullough other important early researchers were frank rosenblatt who invented the perceptron and paul werbos who developed the backpropagation algorithm 145 the main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks where the signal passes in only one direction and recurrent neural networks which allow feedback among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons multi layer perceptrons and radial basis networks 146 among recurrent networks the most famous is the hopfield net a form of attractor network which was first described by john hopfield in 1982 147 neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control for robotics or learning using such techniques as hebbian learning and competitive learning 148 hierarchical temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex 149 edit control theory main article intelligent control control theory the grandchild of cybernetics has many important applications especially in robotics 150 edit languages main article list of programming languages for artificial intelligence ai researchers have developed several specialized languages for ai research including lisp 151 and prolog 152 edit evaluating progress main article progress in artificial intelligence in 1950 alan turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the turing test this procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested however it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail 153 artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry hand writing recognition and game playing such tests have been termed subject matter expert turing tests smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever increasing number of positive results 154 one classification for outcomes of an ai test is 155 optimal it is not possible to perform better strong super human performs better than all humans super human performs better than most humans sub human performs worse than most humans for example performance at draughts is optimal 156 performance at chess is super human and nearing strong super human see computer chess 160 computers versus human and performance at many everyday tasks such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something is sub human a quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from kolmogorov complexity and data compression 157 two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers edit applications an automated online assistant providing customer service on a web page one of many very primitive applications of artificial intelligence this section requires expansion january 2011 main article applications of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list frequently when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence this phenomenon is described as the ai effect 158 edit competitions and prizes main article competitions and prizes in artificial intelligence there are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence the main areas promoted are general machine intelligence conversational behavior data mining driverless cars robot soccer and games edit platforms a platform or computing platform is defined as some sort of hardware architecture or software framework including application frameworks that allows software to run as rodney brooks 159 pointed out many years ago it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the ai features of the platform but rather the actual platform itself that affects the ai that results i e there needs to be work in ai problems on real world platforms rather than in isolation a wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of ai to develop ranging from expert systems albeit pc based but still an entire real world system to various robot platforms such as the widely available roomba with open interface 160 edit philosophy main article philosophy of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy are there limits to how intelligent machines can be is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence can a machine have a mind and consciousness a few of the most influential answers to these questions are given below 161 turing s polite convention we need not decide if a machine can think we need only decide if a machine can act as intelligently as a human being this approach to the philosophical problems associated with artificial intelligence forms the basis of the turing test 153 the dartmouth proposal every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it this conjecture was printed in the proposal for the dartmouth conference of 1956 and represents the position of most working ai researchers 162 newell and simon s physical symbol system hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action newell and simon argue that intelligences consist of formal operations on symbols 163 hubert dreyfus argued that on the contrary human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge see dreyfus critique of ai 164 165 g del s incompleteness theorem a formal system such as a computer program cannot prove all true statements 166 roger penrose is among those who claim that g del s theorem limits what machines can do see the emperor s new mind 167 searle s strong ai hypothesis the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds 168 john searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be 169 the artificial brain argument the brain can be simulated hans moravec ray kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original 86 edit predictions and ethics main articles artificial intelligence in fiction ethics of artificial intelligence transhumanism and technological singularity artificial intelligence is a common topic in both science fiction and projections about the future of technology and society the existence of an artificial intelligence that rivals human intelligence raises difficult ethical issues and the potential power of the technology inspires both hopes and fears in fiction artificial intelligence has appeared fulfilling many roles these include a servant r2d2 in star wars a law enforcer k i t t knight rider a comrade

s frankenstein considers a key issue in the ethics of artificial intelligence if a machine can be created that has intelligence could it also feel if it can feel does it have the same rights as a human the idea also appears in modern science fiction including the films i robot blade runner and a i artificial intelligence in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel human emotions this issue now known as robot rights is currently being considered by for example california s institute for the future although many critics believe that the discussion is premature 170 the subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film plug amp pray 171 martin ford author of the lights in the tunnel automation accelerating technology and the economy of the future 172 and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs ford predicts that many knowledge based occupations and in particular entry level jobs will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems machine learning 173 and other ai enhanced applications ai based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low wage offshore workers making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work 174 joseph weizenbaum wrote that ai applications can not by definition successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of ai technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy 175 was deeply misguided weizenbaum was also bothered that ai researchers and some philosophers were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program a position now known as computationalism to weizenbaum these points suggest that ai research devalues human life 176 many futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress ray kurzweil has used moore s law which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029 he also predicts that by 2045 artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is able to improve itself at a rate that far exceeds anything conceivable in the past a scenario that science fiction writer vernor vinge named the singularity 177 robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either 178 this idea called transhumanism which has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger has been illustrated in fiction as well for example in the manga ghost in the shell and the science fiction series dune in the 1980s artist hajime sorayama s sexy robots series were painted and published in japan depicting the actual organic human form with life like muscular metallic skins and later the gynoids book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including george lukas and other creatives sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form almost 20 years later the first ai robotic pet aibo came available as a companion to people aibo grew out of sony s computer science laboratory csl famed engineer dr toshitada doi is credited as aibo s original progenitor in 1994 he had started work on robots with artificial intelligence expert masahiro fujita within csl of sony doi s friend the artist hajime sorayama was enlisted to create the initial designs for the aibo s body those designs are now part of the permanent collections of museum of modern art and the smithsonian institution with later versions of aibo being used in studies in carnegie mellon university in 2006 aibo was added into carnegie mellon university s robot hall of fame political scientist charles t rubin believes that ai can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be friendly 179 he argues that any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality which has evolved along with our particular biology which ais would not share edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butler s darwin among the machines 1863 and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in 1998 180 edit see also ai portal mind
