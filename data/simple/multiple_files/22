in 1939 he then worked at the metallurgical laboratory at the university of chicago where fermi was developing the first nuclear reactor when world war ii started weinberg then went to work at the newly formed nuclear laboratory in oak ridge tennessee edit work at oak ridge dr weinberg served as director of physics division of the oak ridge national laboratory ornl from 1945 when he was 30 until 1948 when he became research director for the entire oak ridge national laboratory he was named director of the laboratory in 1955 aged 40 1 weinberg often sat in the front row at ornl division information meetings and he would ask the first often very penetrating question after each scientific talk for young scientists giving their first presentation the experience could be frightening but it was also exciting and stimulating when asked how he found the time to attend every meeting weinberg replied jokingly we didn t have a doe in those days edit reactor development eugene wigner left with weinberg at ornl weinberg had the materials testing reactor converted into a mock up of a real reactor called the low intensity test reactor litr or the poor man s pile the first reactors were called piles since they were constucted of piles of fissile material and of shielding experiments at the litr led to the design of both pressurized water pwr and boiling water nuclear reactors bwr which have since become the dominant reactor types in commercial nuclear power plants weinberg was attracted to the simplicity and self controlling features of nuclear reactors with fluid fuels such as drs harold urey and eugene wigner s proposed aqueous homogeneous reactor therefore to support of the nuclear aircraft project in the late 1940s weinberg asked ornl s reactor engineers to design a reactor using liquid fuel instead of solid fuel 2 this homogeneous reactor experiment hre was affectionately dubbed alvin s 3p reactor because it required a pot a pipe and a pump the hre went into operation in 1950 and at the criticality party weinberg brought the appropriate spirits when piles go critical in chicago we celebrate with wine when piles go critical in tennessee we celebrate with jack daniel s the hre operated for 105 days before it was closed down weinberg even hosted senator jack kennedy and senator albert gore sr on their visit to ornl 3 despite its leaks and corrosion valuable information was still gained from operation of the hre and it proved a simple and safe reactor to control edit molten salt reactors weinberg noting 6000 full power hours of msre operation in 1967 the aircraft nuclear propulsion anp project was ornl s biggest program which provided 25 of ornl s budget 4 the anp project s military goal was to produce a nuclear powered aircraft bomber to overcome the range limitations of jet fueled aircraft of the time ornl successfully built and operated a prototype of an aircraft reactor powerplant by creating the world s first molten salt fueled and cooled reactor called the are aircraft reactor experiment in 1954 which set a record high temperature of operation of 815 c 1 500 f red heat 5 because of the radiation hazard to the aircraft crews and because of the new developments of ballistic missiles of mid air refueling and of longer range jet propelled bombers president kennedy killed the military s aircraft nuclear propulsion anp program in june 1961 6 this allowed ornl to shift its focus to a civilian version of the meltdown proof molten salt reactor msr away from the military s daft idea of nuclear powered aircraft 7 that civilian pilot plant the molten salt reactor experiment msre set a record for continuous operation and was the first to use uranium 233 as fuel and also used plutonium 239 as well as the normal and naturally occurring uranium 235 the msr was known as the chemist s reactor because it was proposed by mainly chemists ornl s ray briant and ed bettis an engineer and nepa s vince calkins 8 and because it is a chemical solution of melted compounds salts containing the actinides uranium thorium and or plutonium in a carrier salt most often composed of beryllium bef 2 and lithium lif note the lithium is isotopically enriched in lithium 7 to prevent excessive neutron capture or tritium production flibe 9 the msr also affords the opportunity to change the chemistry of the molten salt while the reactor was operating to remove fission products the nuclear ashes and add new fuel or change the fuel all of which is called online processing edit biological and environmental studies under weinberg s tenure as director ornl s biology division grew to five times the size of the next largest division this division was charged with understanding how ionizing radiation interacts with living things and to try to find ways to help them survive radiation damage such as bone marrow transplants in the 1960s weinberg also pursued new missions for ornl such as using nuclear energy to desalinate seawater he recruited philip hammond from los alamos to further this mission and in 1970 started the first big ecology project in the united states the national science foundation research applied to national needs environmental program edit leadership in 1958 weinberg coauthored the first nuclear reactor textbook the physical theory of neutron chain reactors with nobel laureate eugene wigner he was elected president of the american nuclear society in 1959 and began service on president s science advisory committee the following year advising presidents eisenhower and kennedy 10 starting in 1945 with patent 2 736 696 weinberg and usually with his friend eugene wigner filed numerous patents on the light water reactor lwr technology that has become our primary nuclear reactors the main lwr types are pressurized water reactors pwrs and boiling water reactors bwrs that serve in naval propulsion and commercial nuclear power 11 in 1965 he was appointed vice president of the union carbide corporation s nuclear division 12 edit weinberg s firing impacts msr and thorium based nuclear fuel research weinberg was fired by the nixon administration from ornl in 1973 after 18 years as the lab s director because he continued to advocate increased nuclear safety and molten salt reactors instead of the administration s chosen liquid metal fast breeder reactor lmfbr that the aec s director of reactor division milton shaw was appointed to develop 13 weinberg s firing effectively halted development of the msr as it was virtually unknown by other nuclear labs and specialists 14 there was a brief revival of msr research at ornl as part of the carter administration s nonproliferation interests culminating in ornl tm 7207 1980 07 conceptual design characteristics of a denatured molten salt reactor with once through fueling by engel et al it is still considered by many to be the reference design for widespread commercial molten salt reactors msrs 15 16 ornl had also done the majority of research on thorium as a nuclear fuel in other reactors such as pwrs so weinberg s firing reduced thorium s nuclear fuel research the next and the only demonstration of thorium breeding uranium 233 was during the carter administration when admiral rickover along with his nuclear core designer dr alvin radkowsky successfully replaced the enriched uranium core with a seed and blanket based core using thorium and u 233 in the usa s first commercial power plant at shippingport pennsylvania to create the light water breeder reactor lwbr 17 18 19 20 despite this successful demonstration of net breeding of u 233 fissile from thorium in 1982 in a pressurized water reactor pwr no further research or development would be done until the 1990s 19 in 1992 dr alvin radkowsky formed the commercial firm thorium power inc to further develop the lwbr s seed and blanket unit sbu based re coring of existing pwrs with fuels consisting of mainly thorium instead of uranium 238 21 during the 1990s the clinton administration backed thorium power s lwbr technology adaptation to destroy excess russian military plutonium in proliferation resistant recorded pwrs vver in russia with the u s doe s initiatives for proliferation prevention program funding and oversight from brookhaven national laboratory bnl 22 23 the russian usa cooperative venture for peaceful uses of nuclear power and therefore the thorium power inc now lightbridge corporation 21 program to destroy excess russian military plutonium in the sbu cored vver was stopped by the bush administration in 2008 after the russian invasion of georgia us russian 123 agreement was withdrawn from congress consideration in 2008 24 25 edit after the oak ridge years edit washington and orau weinberg was named director of the u s office of energy research and development in washington d c in 1974 the following year he founded and became the first director of institute for energy analysis at oak ridge associated universities orau this institute focused on evaluating alternatives for meeting future energy requirements from 1976 to 1984 the institute for energy analysis was a center for study of diverse issues related to carbon dioxide and global climate 26 weinberg worked at orau until retiring to become an orau distinguished fellow in 1985 edit retirement weinberg remained active in retirement in 1992 he was named chairman of the international friendship bell committee which arranged for the installation of a japanese bell in oak ridge he also called for strengthening of the international atomic
