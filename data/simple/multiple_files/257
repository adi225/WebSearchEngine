the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser html is written in the form of html elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets like lt html gt within the web page content html tags most commonly come in pairs like lt h1 gt and lt h1 gt although some tags known as empty elements are unpaired for example lt img gt the first tag in a pair is the start tag the second tag is the end tag they are also called opening tags and closing tags in between these tags web designers can add text tags comments and other types of text based content the purpose of a web browser is to read html documents and compose them into visible or audible web pages the browser does not display the html tags but uses the tags to interpret the content of the page html elements form the building blocks of all websites html allows images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive forms it provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings paragraphs lists links quotes and other items it can embed scripts written in languages such as javascript which affect the behavior of html web pages web browsers can also refer to cascading style sheets css to define the appearance and layout of text and other material the w3c maintainer of both the html and the css standards encourages the use of css over explicit presentational html markup 1 contents 1 history 1 1 development 1 2 version history of the standard 1 2 1 html version timeline 1 2 2 html draft

the w3c edit development tim berners lee in 1980 physicist tim berners lee who was a contractor at cern proposed and prototyped enquire a system for cern researchers to use and share documents in 1989 berners lee wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system 2 berners lee specified html and wrote the browser and server software in the last part of 1990 in that year berners lee and cern data systems engineer robert cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding but the project was not formally adopted by cern in his personal notes 3 from 1990 he listed 4 some of the many areas in which hypertext is used and put an encyclopedia first the first publicly available description of html was a document called html tags first mentioned on the internet by berners lee in late 1991 5 6 it describes 18 elements comprising the initial relatively simple design of html except for the hyperlink tag these were strongly influenced by sgmlguid an in house sgml based documentation format at cern eleven of these elements still exist in html 4 7 hypertext markup language is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text images and other material into visual or audible web pages default characteristics for every item of html markup are defined in the browser and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer s additional use of css many of the text elements are found in the 1988 iso technical report tr 9537 techniques for using sgml which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the runoff command developed in the early 1960s for the ctss compatible time sharing system operating system these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents however the sgml concept of generalized markup is based on elements nested annotated ranges with attributes rather than merely print effects with also the separation of structure and processing html has been progressively moved in this direction with css berners lee considered html to be an application of sgml it was formally defined as such by the internet engineering task force ietf with the mid 1993 publication of the first proposal for an html specification hypertext markup language html internet draft by berners lee and dan connolly which included an sgml document type definition to define the grammar 8 the draft expired after six months but was notable for its acknowledgment of the ncsa mosaic browser s custom tag for embedding in line images reflecting the ietf s philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes 9 similarly dave raggett s competing internet draft html hypertext markup format from late 1993 suggested standardizing already implemented features like tables and fill out forms 10 after the html and html drafts expired in early 1994 the ietf created an html working group which in 1995 completed html 2 0 the first html specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based 11 further development under the auspices of the ietf was stalled by competing interests since 1996 the html specifications have been maintained with input from commercial software vendors by the world wide web consortium w3c 12 however in 2000 html also became an international standard iso iec 15445 2000 html 4 01 was published in late 1999 with further errata published through 2001 in 2004 development began on html5 in the web hypertext application technology working group whatwg which became a joint

dropped math formulas entirely reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of netscape s visual markup tags netscape s blink element and microsoft s marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies 12 a markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in html was not standardized until 14 months later in mathml december 1997 html 4 0 16 was published as a w3c recommendation it offers three variations strict in which deprecated elements are forbidden transitional in which deprecated elements are allowed frameset in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed initially code named cougar 15 html 4 0 adopted many browser specific element types and attributes but at the same time sought to phase out netscape s visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets html 4 is an sgml application conforming to iso 8879 sgml 17 april 1998 html 4 0 18 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number december 1999 html 4 01 19 was published as a w3c recommendation it offers the same three variations as html 4 0 and its last errata were published may 12 2001 may 2000 iso iec

published by the ietf iiir working group as an internet draft a rough proposal for a standard it was replaced by a second version 27 one month later followed by six further drafts published by ietf itself 28 that finally led to html 2 0 in rfc1866 november 1993 html was published by the ietf as an internet draft and was a competing proposal to the hypertext markup language draft it expired in may 1994 april 1995 authored march 1995 html 3 0 29 was proposed as a standard to the ietf but the proposal expired five months later without further action it included many of the capabilities that were in raggett s html proposal such as support for tables text flow around figures and the display of complex mathematical formulas 30 w3c began development of its own arena browser as a test bed for html 3 and cascading style sheets 31 32 33 but html 3 0 did not succeed for several reasons the draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development as well as the number of interested parties had outstripped the resources of the ietf 12 browser vendors including microsoft and netscape at the time chose to implement different subsets of html 3 s draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it 12 see browser wars these included extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents contrary to the belief of the academic engineering community that such things as text color background texture font size and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be organized 12 dave raggett who has been a w3c fellow for many years has commented for example to a certain extent microsoft built its business on the web by extending html features 12 january 2008 html5 was published as a working draft link by the w3c 34 although its syntax closely resembles that of sgml html5 has abandoned any attempt to be an sgml application and has explicitly defined its own html serialization in addition to an alternative xml based xhtml5 serialization 35 may 2011 on 14 february 2011 the w3c extended the charter of its html working group with clear milestones for html5 in may 2011 the working group advanced html5 to last call an invitation to communities inside and outside w3c to confirm the technical soundness of the specification the w3c is developing a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014 which is now the target date for recommendation 36 edit xhtml versions main article xhtml xhtml is a separate language that began as a reformulation of html 4 01 using xml 1 0 it continues to be developed xhtml 1 0 37 published january 26 2000 as a w3c recommendation later revised and republished august 1 2002 it offers the same three variations as html 4 0 and 4 01 reformulated in xml with minor restrictions xhtml 1 1 38 published may 31 2001 as a w3c recommendation it is based on xhtml 1 0 strict but includes minor changes can be customized is reformulated using modules from modularization of xhtml which was published april 10 2001 as a w3c recommendation xhtml 2 0 was a working draft but work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on html5 and xhtml5 39 40 41 xhtml 2 0 was incompatible with xhtml 1 x and therefore would be more accurately characterized as an xhtml inspired new language than an update to xhtml 1 x xhtml5 which is an update to xhtml 1 x is being defined alongside html5 in the html5 draft 42 edit markup html markup consists of several key components including elements and their attributes character based data types character references and entity references another important component is the document type declaration which triggers standards mode rendering the following is an example of the classic hello world program a common test employed for comparing programming languages scripting languages and markup languages this example is made using 9 lines of code lt doctype html gt lt html gt lt head gt lt title gt hello html lt title gt lt head gt lt body gt lt p gt hello world lt p gt lt body gt lt html gt the text between lt html gt and lt html gt describes the web page and the text between lt body gt and lt body gt is the visible page content the markup text lt title gt hello html lt title gt defines the browser page title this document type declaration is for html5 if the lt doctype html gt declaration is not included various browsers will revert to quirks mode for rendering 43 edit elements main article html element html documents are composed entirely of html elements that in their most general form have three components a pair of tags a start tag and end tag some attributes within the start tag and finally any textual and graphical content between the start and end tags perhaps including other nested elements the html element is everything between and including the start and end tags each tag is enclosed in angle brackets the general form of an html element is therefore lt tag attribute1 value1 attribute2 value2 gt content lt tag gt some html elements are defined as empty elements and take the form lt tag attribute1 value1 attribute2 value2 gt empty elements may enclose no content for instance the br tag or the inline img tag the name of an html element is the name used in the tags note that the end tag s name is preceded by a slash character and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed if attributes are not mentioned default values are used in each case edit element examples header of the html document lt head gt lt head gt usually the title should be included in the head for example lt head gt lt title gt the title lt title gt lt head gt headings html headings are defined with the lt h1 gt to lt h6 gt tags lt h1 gt heading1 lt h1 gt lt h2 gt heading2 lt h2 gt lt h3 gt heading3 lt h3 gt lt h4 gt heading4 lt h4 gt lt h5 gt heading5 lt h5 gt lt h6 gt heading6 lt h6 gt paragraphs lt p gt paragraph 1 lt p gt lt p gt paragraph 2 lt p gt line breaks lt br gt the difference between lt br gt and lt p gt is that br breaks a line without altering the semantic structure of the page whereas p sections the page into paragraphs note also that br is an empty element in that while it may have attributes it can take no content and it may not have an end tag lt p gt this lt br gt is a paragraph lt br gt with lt br gt line breaks lt p gt comments lt this is a comment gt comments can help in the understanding of the markup and do not display in the webpage there are several types of markup elements used in html structural markup describes the purpose of text for example lt h2 gt golf lt h2 gt establishes golf as a second level heading structural markup does not denote any specific rendering but most web browsers have default styles for element formatting content may be further styled using cascading style sheets css presentational markup describes the appearance of the text regardless of its purpose for example lt b gt boldface lt b gt indicates that visual output devices should render boldface in bold text but gives little indication what devices that are unable to do this such as aural devices that read the text aloud should do in the case of both lt b gt bold lt b gt and lt i gt italic lt i gt there are other elements that may have equivalent visual renderings but which are more semantic in nature such as lt strong gt strong text lt strong gt and lt em gt emphasised text lt em gt respectively it is easier to see how an aural user agent should interpret the latter two elements however they are not equivalent to their presentational counterparts it would be undesirable for a screen reader to emphasize the name of a book for instance but on a screen such a name would be italicized most presentational markup elements have become deprecated under the html 4 0 specification in favor of using css for styling hypertext markup makes parts of a document into links to other documents an anchor element creates a hyperlink in the document and its href attribute sets the link s target url for example the html markup lt a 160 href http www google com gt wikipedia lt a gt will render the word wikipedia as a hyperlink to render an image as a hyperlink an img element is inserted as content into the a element like br img is an empty element with attributes but no content or closing tag lt a href http example org gt lt img src image gif alt descriptive text width 50 height 50 border 0 gt lt a gt edit attributes most of the attributes of an element are name value pairs separated by and written within the start tag of an element after the element s name the value may be enclosed in single or double quotes although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in html but not xhtml 44 45 leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe 46 in contrast with name value pair attributes there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element 5 like the ismap attribute for the img element 47 there are several common attributes that may appear in many elements the id attribute provides a document wide unique identifier for an element this is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties and scripts may alter animate or delete its contents or presentation appended to the url of the page it provides a globally unique identifier for the element typically a sub section of the page for example the id attributes in http en wikipedia org wiki html attributes the class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements this can be used for semantic or presentation purposes for example an html document might semantically use the designation class notation to indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the main text of the document in presentation such elements might be gathered together and presented as footnotes on a page instead of appearing in the place where they occur in the html source class attributes are used semantically in microformats multiple class values may be specified for example class notation important puts the element into both the notation and the important classes an author may use the style attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element it is considered better practice to use an element s id or class attributes to select the element from within a stylesheet though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple specific or ad hoc styling the title attribute is used to attach subtextual explanation to an element in most browsers this attribute is displayed as a tooltip the lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element s contents which may be different from that of the rest of the document for example in an english language document lt p gt oh well lt span lang fr gt c est la vie lt span gt as they say in france lt p gt the abbreviation element abbr can be used to demonstrate some of these attributes lt abbr id anid class jargon style color purple title hypertext markup language gt html lt abbr gt this example displays as html in most browsers pointing the cursor at the abbreviation should display the title text hypertext markup language most elements also take the language related attribute dir to specify text direction such as with rtl for right to left text in for examples arabic persian or hebrew 48 edit character and entity references see also list of xml and html character entity references 160 and unicode and html as of version 4 0 html defines a set of 252 character entity references and a set of 1 114 050 numeric character references both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup rather than literally a literal character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically the ability to escape characters in this way allows for the characters lt and amp when written as amp lt and amp amp respectively to be interpreted as character data rather than markup for example a literal lt normally indicates the start of a tag and amp normally indicates the start of a character entity reference or numeric character reference writing it as amp amp or amp x26 or amp 38 allows amp to be included in the content of an element or in the value of an attribute the double quote character when not used to quote an attribute value must also be escaped as amp quot or amp x22 or amp 34 when it appears within the attribute value itself equivalently the single quote character when not used to quote an attribute value must also be escaped as amp x27 or amp 39 not as amp apos except in xhtml documents 49 when it appears within the attribute value itself if document authors overlook the need to escape such characters some browsers can be very forgiving and try to use context to guess their intent the result is still invalid markup which makes the document less accessible to other browsers and to other user agents that may try to parse the document for search and indexing purposes for example escaping also allows for characters that are not easily typed or that are not available in the document s character encoding to be represented within element and attribute content for example the acute accented e a character typically found only on western european keyboards can be written in any html document as the entity reference amp eacute or as the numeric references amp xe9 or amp 233 using characters that are available on all keyboards and are supported in all character encodings unicode character encodings such as utf 8 are compatible with all modern browsers and allow direct access to almost all the characters of the world s writing systems 50 edit data types html defines several data types for element content such as script data and stylesheet data and a plethora of types for attribute values including ids names uris numbers units of length languages media descriptors colors character encodings dates and times and so on all of these data types are specializations of character data edit document type declaration html documents are required to start with a document type declaration informally a doctype in browsers the doctype helps to define the rendering mode particularly whether to use quirks mode the original purpose of the doctype was to enable parsing and validation of html documents by sgml tools based on the document type definition dtd the dtd to which the doctype refers contains a machine readable grammar specifying the permitted and prohibited content for a document conforming to such a dtd browsers on the other hand do not implement html as an application of sgml and by consequence do not read the dtd html5 does not define a dtd therefore in html5 the doctype declaration is simpler and shorter lt doctype html gt an example of an html 4 doctype is lt doctype html public w3c dtd html 4 01 en http www w3 org tr html4 strict dtd gt this declaration references the dtd for the strict version of html 4 01 sgml based validators read the dtd in order to properly parse the document and to perform validation in modern browsers a valid doctype activates standards mode as opposed to quirks mode in addition html 4 01 provides transitional and frameset dtds as explained below edit semantic html main article semantic html semantic html is a way of writing html that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation look html has included semantic markup from its inception 51 but has also included presentational markup such as lt font gt lt i gt and lt center gt tags there are also the semantically neutral span and div tags since the late 1990s when cascading style sheets were beginning to work in most browsers web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational html markup with a view to the separation of presentation and content 52 in a 2001 discussion of the semantic web tim berners lee and others gave examples of ways in which intelligent software agents may one day automatically trawl the web and find filter and correlate previously unrelated published facts for the benefit of human users 53 such agents are not commonplace even now but some of the ideas of web 2 0 mashups and price comparison websites may be coming close the main difference between these web application hybrids and berners lee s semantic agents lies in the fact that the current aggregation and hybridization of information is usually designed in by web developers who already know the web locations and the api semantics of the specific data they wish to mash compare and combine an important type of web agent that does trawl and read web pages automatically without prior knowledge of what it might find is the web crawler or search engine spider these software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity of web pages they find as they use various techniques and algorithms to read and index millions of web pages a day and provide web users with search facilities without which the world wide web would be only a fraction of its current usefulness in order for search engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of text they find in html documents and also for those creating mashups and other hybrids as well as for more automated agents as they are developed the semantic structures that exist in html need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of published text 54 presentational markup tags are deprecated in current html and xhtml recommendations and are illegal in html5 good semantic html also improves the accessibility of web documents see also web content accessibility guidelines for example when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the structure of a document it will not waste the visually impaired user s time by reading out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly edit delivery html documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file however they are most often delivered either by http from a web server or by email edit http main article hypertext transfer protocol the world wide web is composed primarily of html documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the hypertext transfer protocol http however http is used to serve images sound and other content in addition to html to allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives other information is transmitted along with the document this meta data usually includes the mime type e g text html or application xhtml xml and the character encoding see character encoding in html in modern browsers the mime type that is sent with the html document may affect how the document is initially interpreted a document sent with the xhtml mime type is expected to be well formed xml syntax errors may cause the browser to fail to render it the same document sent with the html mime type might be displayed successfully since some browsers are more lenient with html the w3c recommendations state that xhtml 1 0 documents that follow guidelines set forth in the recommendation s appendix c may be labeled with either mime type 55 xhtml 1 1 also states that xhtml 1 1 documents should 56 be labeled with either mime type 57 edit html e mail main article html email most graphical email clients allow the use of a subset of html often ill defined to provide formatting and semantic markup not available with plain text this may include typographic information like coloured headings emphasized and quoted text inline images and diagrams many such clients include both a gui editor for composing html e mail messages and a rendering engine for displaying them use of html in e mail is controversial because of compatibility issues because it can help disguise phishing attacks because of accessibility issues for blind or visually impaired people because it can confuse spam filters and because the message size is larger than plain text edit naming conventions the most common filename extension for files containing html is html a common abbreviation of this is htm which originated because some early operating systems and file systems such as dos and fat limited file extensions to three letters edit html application main article html application an html application hta file extension hta is a microsoft windows application that uses html and dynamic html in a browser to provide the application s graphical interface a regular html file is confined to the security model of the web browser s security communicating only to web servers and manipulating only webpage objects and site cookies an hta runs as a fully trusted application and therefore has more privileges like creation editing removal of files and windows registry entries because they operate outside the browser s security model htas cannot be executed via http but must be downloaded just like an exe file and executed from local file system edit current variations html is precisely what we were trying to prevent ever breaking links links going outward only quotes you can t follow to their origins no version management no rights management ted nelson 58 since its inception html and its associated protocols gained acceptance relatively quickly however no clear standards existed in the early years of the language though its creators originally conceived of html as a semantic language devoid of presentation details 59 practical uses pushed many presentational elements and attributes into the language driven largely by the various browser vendors the latest standards surrounding html reflect efforts to overcome the sometimes chaotic development of the language 60 and to create a rational foundation for building both meaningful and well presented documents to return html to its role as a semantic language the w3c has developed style languages such as css and xsl to shoulder the burden of presentation in conjunction the html specification has slowly reined in the presentational elements there are two axes differentiating various variations of html as currently specified sgml based html versus xml based html referred to as xhtml on one axis and strict versus transitional loose versus frameset on the other axis edit sgml based versus xml based html one difference in the latest html specifications lies in the distinction between the sgml based specification and the xml based specification the xml based specification is usually called xhtml to distinguish it clearly from the more traditional definition however the root element name continues to be html even in the xhtml specified html the w3c intended xhtml 1 0 to be identical to html 4 01 except where limitations of xml over the more complex sgml require workarounds because xhtml and html are closely related they are sometimes documented in parallel in such circumstances some authors conflate the two names as x html or x html like html 4 01 xhtml 1 0 has three sub specifications strict transitional and frameset aside from the different opening declarations for a document the differences between an html 4 01 and xhtml 1 0 document in each of the corresponding dtds are largely syntactic the underlying syntax of html allows many shortcuts that xhtml does not such as elements with optional opening or closing tags and even empty elements which must not have an end tag by contrast xhtml requires all elements to have an opening tag and a closing tag xhtml however also introduces a new shortcut an xhtml tag may be opened and closed within the same tag by including a slash before the end of the tag like this lt br gt the introduction of this shorthand which is not used in the sgml declaration for html 4 01 may confuse earlier software unfamiliar with this new convention a fix for this is to include a space before closing the tag as such lt br gt 61 to understand the subtle differences between html and xhtml consider the transformation of a valid and well formed xhtml 1 0 document that adheres to appendix c see below into a valid html 4 01 document to make this translation requires the following steps the language for an element should be specified with a lang attribute rather than the xhtml xml lang attribute xhtml uses xml s built in language defining functionality attribute remove the xml namespace xmlns uri html has no facilities for namespaces change the document type declaration from xhtml 1 0 to html 4 01 see dtd section for further explanation if present remove the xml declaration typically this is lt xml version 1 0 encoding utf 8 gt ensure that the document s mime type is set to text html for both html and xhtml this comes from the http content type header sent by the server change the xml empty element syntax to an html style empty element lt br gt to lt br gt those are the main changes necessary to translate a document from xhtml 1 0 to html 4 01 to translate from html to xhtml would also require the addition of any omitted opening or closing tags whether coding in html or xhtml it may just be best to always include the optional tags within an html document rather than remembering which tags can be omitted a well formed xhtml document adheres to all the syntax requirements of xml a valid document adheres to the content specification for xhtml which describes the document structure the w3c recommends several conventions to ensure an easy migration between html and xhtml see html compatibility guidelines the following steps can be applied to xhtml 1 0 documents only include both xml lang and lang attributes on any elements assigning language use the empty element syntax only for elements specified as empty in html include an extra space in empty element tags for example lt br gt instead of lt br gt include explicit close tags for elements that permit content but are left empty for example lt div gt lt div gt not lt div gt omit the xml declaration by carefully following the w3c s compatibility guidelines a user agent should be able to interpret the document equally as html or xhtml for documents that are xhtml 1 0 and have been made compatible in this way the w3c permits them to be served either as html with a text html mime type or as xhtml with an application xhtml xml or application xml mime type when delivered as xhtml browsers should use an xml parser which adheres strictly to the xml specifications for parsing the document s contents edit transitional versus strict html 4 defined three different versions of the language strict transitional once called loose and frameset the strict version is intended for new documents and is considered best practice while the transitional and frameset versions were developed to make it easier to transition documents that conformed to older html specification or didn t conform to any specification to a version of html 4 the transitional and frameset versions allow for presentational markup which is omitted in the strict version instead cascading style sheets are encouraged to improve the presentation of html documents because xhtml 1 only defines an xml syntax for the language defined by html 4 the same differences apply to xhtml 1 as well the transitional version allows the following parts of the vocabulary which are not included in the strict version a looser content model inline elements and plain text are allowed directly in body blockquote form noscript and noframes presentation related elements underline u deprecated can confuse a visitor with a hyperlink strike through s center deprecated use css instead font deprecated use css instead basefont deprecated use css instead presentation related attributes background deprecated use css instead and bgcolor deprecated use css instead

frameset version includes everything in the transitional version as well as the frameset element used instead of body and the frame element edit frameset versus transitional in addition to the above transitional differences the frameset specifications whether xhtml 1 0 or html 4 01 specifies a different content model with frameset replacing body that contains either frame elements or optionally noframes with a body edit summary of specification versions as this list demonstrates the loose versions of the specification are maintained for legacy support however contrary to popular misconceptions the move to xhtml does not imply a removal of this legacy support rather the x in xml stands for extensible and the w3c is modularizing the entire specification and opening it up to independent extensions the primary achievement in the move from xhtml 1 0 to xhtml 1 1 is the modularization of the entire specification the strict version of html is deployed in xhtml 1 1 through a set of modular extensions to the base xhtml 1 1 specification likewise someone looking for the loose transitional or frameset specifications will find similar extended xhtml 1 1 support much of it is contained in the legacy or frame modules the modularization also allows for separate features to develop on their own timetable so for example xhtml 1 1 will allow quicker migration to emerging xml standards such as mathml a presentational and semantic math language based on xml and xforms a new highly advanced web form technology to replace the existing html forms in summary the html 4 01 specification primarily reined in all the various html implementations into a single clearly written specification based on sgml xhtml 1 0 ported this specification as is to the new xml defined specification next xhtml 1 1 takes advantage of the extensible nature of xml and modularizes the whole specification xhtml 2 0 was intended to be the first step in adding new features to the specification in a standards body based approach edit whatwg html versus html5 main article html5 the whatwg considers their work as living standard html for what constitutes the state of the art in major browser implementations by apple safari google chrome microsoft ie mozilla firefox opera opera and others html5 is specified by the html working group of the w3c following the w3c process as of 2013 update both specifications are similar and mostly derived from each other i e the work on html5 started with an older whatwg draft and later the whatwg living standard was based on html5 drafts in 2011 62 63 edit hypertext features not in html html lacks some of the features found in earlier hypertext systems such as typed links source tracking fat links and others 64 even some hypertext features that were in early versions of html have been ignored by most popular web browsers until recently such as the link element and in browser web page editing sometimes web services or browser manufacturers remedy these shortcomings for instance wikis and content management systems allow surfers to edit the web pages they visit edit wysiwyg editors there are some wysiwyg editors what you see is what you get in which the user lays out everything as it is to appear in the html document using a graphical user interface gui where the editor renders this as an html document no longer requiring the author to have extensive knowledge of html the wysiwyg editing model has been criticized 65 66 primarily because of the low quality of the generated code there are voices advocating a change to the wysiwym model what you see is what you mean wysiwyg editors remains a controversial topic because of their perceived flaws such as relying mainly on layout as opposed to meaning often using markup that does not convey the intended meaning but simply copies the layout 67 often producing extremely verbose and redundant code that fails to make use of the cascading nature of html and css often producing ungrammatical markup often called tag soup as a great deal of the information in html documents is not in the layout the model has been criticized for its what you see is all you get nature 68 edit see also breadcrumb navigation comparison of html parsers css dynamic web page html decimal character rendering html5 http list of document markup languages list of xml and html
