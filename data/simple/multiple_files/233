collaboration project announced on 27 september 1983 by richard stallman at mit its aim is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on the following freedom rights users are free to run the software share it copy distribute study it and modify it gnu software guarantees these freedom rights legally via its license and is therefore free software the use of the word free always being taken to refer to freedom in order to ensure that the entire software of a computer grants its users all freedom rights use share study modify even the most fundamental and important part the operating system including all its numerous utility programs needed to be written the founding goal of the project was in the words of its initial announcement to develop a sufficient body of free software to get along without any software that is not free 2 stallman decided to call this operating system gnu a humorous recursive acronym meaning gnu s not unix basing its design on that of unix however in contrast to unix which was proprietary software gnu was to be freedom respecting software free software that users can use share study and modify development was initiated in january 1984 the goal of making a completely free software operating system was achieved in 1992 when the the third party linux kernel was released as free software under version 2 of the gnu general public license to be used with the gnu software stack the project s current work includes

started they had an emacs text editor with lisp for writing editor commands a source level debugger a yacc compatible parser generator and a linker 3 the gnu system required its own c compiler and tools to be free software so that these also had to be developed by june 1987 the project had accumulated and developed free software for an assember an almost finished portable optimizing c compiler gcc an editor gnu emacs and various unix utilities such as ls grep awk make and ld 4 they had an initial kernel that needed more updates once the kernel and the compiler were finished gnu was able to be used for program development the main goal was to create many other applications to be like the unix system gnu was able to run unix programs but was not identical to it gnu incorporated longer file names file version numbers and a crashproof file system the gnu manifesto was written to gain support and participation from others for the project programmers were encouraged to take part in any aspect of the project that interested them people could donate funds computer parts or even their own time to write code and programs for the project 2 edit gnu manifesto main article gnu manifesto the gnu manifesto was written by richard stallman to gain support and participation in the gnu project in the gnu manifesto stallman listed four freedoms essential to software development freedom to run a program for any purpose freedom to study the mechanics of the program and modify it freedom to redistribute copies and freedom to improve and change modified versions for public use 5 to implement these freedoms users needed full access to code to ensure code remained free and provide it to the public stallman created the gnu general public license gpl which allowed software and the future generations of code derived from it to remain free for public use some complications arose however when certain software was grandfathered in the law of gpl because of code from which it derived 5 edit philosophy and activism main article free software movement although most of the gnu project s output is technical in nature it was launched as a social ethical and political initiative as well as producing software and licenses the gnu project has published a number of writings the majority of which were authored by richard stallman edit participation within the gnu website a list of projects are laid out and each project has specifics for what type of developer is able to perform the task needed for a certain piece of the gnu project the skill level ranges from project to project but anyone with background knowledge in programming is encouraged to support the project edit free software the gnu project uses software that is free for users to copy edit and distribute it is free in the sense that users can change the software to fit individual needs the way programmers obtain the free software depends on where they get it the software could be provided to the programmer from friends or over the internet or the company a programmer works for may purchase the software edit funding proceeds from purchases support the gnu project edit copyleft main article copyleft copyleft is what helps maintain free use of this software among other programmers copyleft gives the legal right to everyone to use edit and redistribute programs or program s code as long as the distribution terms do not change as a result any user who obtains the software legally has the same freedoms as the rest of its users do the gnu project and the fsf sometimes differentiate between strong and weak copyleft weak copyleft programs typically allow distributors to link them together with non free programs while strong copyleft strictly forbids this practice most of the gnu project s output is released under a strong copyleft although some is released under a weak copyleft or a permissive free software license edit operating system development gnu hurd live cd main article gnu the first goal of the gnu project was to create a whole free software operating system by 1992 the gnu project had completed all of the major operating system components except for their kernel gnu hurd with the release of the linux kernel started independently by linus torvalds in 1991 and released under the gpl with version 0 12 in 1992 for the first time it was possible to run an operating system composed completely of free software though the linux kernel is not part of the gnu project it was developed using gcc and other gnu programming tools 6 edit gnu linux today a stable version or variant of gnu can be run by combining the gnu packages with the unix like kernel linux the gnu project calls this gnu linux and the defining features are the combination of gnu packages 7 8 except for gnu hurd the gnu packages consists of numerous operating system tools and utilities shell coreutils compilers libraries etc 7 8 including a library implementation of all of the functions specified in posix system application program interface posix 1 9 10 the gcc compiler can generate machine code for a large variety of computer architectures 11 linux kernel this implements program scheduling multitasking device drivers memory management etc and allows the system to run on a large variety of computer architectures 12 linus torvalds released the linux kernel under the gnu general public license in 1992 13 it is however not part of the gnu project 14 15 16 17 non gnu programs this consists of programs that the gnu project has selected as being meant for use with the gnu system and are listed on the gnu org website 18 these programs were already available as free software and thus did not have to be written by the gnu project these programs have terms of use and distribution that are compatible with gnu s freedom goals examples include the x window system 19 a complete listing of non gnu programs under free licenses including programs not mentioned at gnu org is maintained by the fsf 20 examples include boost 21 the packaging of gnu tools together with the linux kernel and other programs is termed a gnu linux distro distribution and many different distros exist most distros call the combination simply linux while the gnu project uses the name gnu linux and recommends this name 22 since numerous users of the system don t even know that they are using gnu packages and are unaware of the freedoms that are the motivation for why the widely used gnu packages exist 23 the gnu project also states that calling the entire system only linux promotes only the views of linux organizations linus torvalds and various distros views that emphasize system s popularity stability robustness and usability 24 25 while demoting and sidelining the philosophy and ideas behind the actual creation of gnu packages itself namely the freedom rights of users viewed as an important social political and ethical ideology concern hence the gnu project s request of mentioning the name gnu gnu linux 26 today most distros combine gnu packages with a linux kernel which contains proprietary binary blobs and a number of proprietary programs e g gratis but without availability of source code thus non free they are free to do so but it goes directly against the freedom goals of the gnu project these freedom goals being the reason why the gnu project was started in the first place the gnu project itself only endorses distros 27 that are a combination of gnu packages with a linux libre kernel a modified linux kernel that removes proprietary binary blobs and consist only of free software eschewing proprietary software entirely 28 these distros are usually based on modifications of the debian distro 29 making it completely free of proprietary software availability it is possible to obtain an entirely free freedom respecting system using other distros such as debian itself however since these distros include e g an online package database that also includes nonfree software i e zero price but without source the gnu project does not endorse them since it maintains that this may guide users towards nonfree software 30 31 edit strategic projects see also free software foundation high priority projects from the mid 1990s onward with many companies investing in free software development the free software foundation redirected its funds toward the legal and political support of free software development software development from that point on focused on maintaining existing projects and starting new projects only when there was an acute threat to the free software community one of the most notable projects of the gnu project is the gnu compiler collection whose components have been adopted as the standard compiler system on many unix like systems edit gnome the gnome desktop effort was launched by the gnu project because another desktop system kde was becoming popular but required users to install certain proprietary software to prevent people from being tempted to install that proprietary software the gnu project simultaneously launched two projects one was the harmony toolkit this was an attempt to make a free software replacement for the proprietary software that kde depended on had this project been successful the problem with kde would have been solved the second project was gnome which tackled the same issue from a different angle it aimed to make a replacement for kde that had no dependencies on proprietary software the harmony project didn t make much progress but gnome developed very well eventually the proprietary component that kde depended on qt was released as free software 32 edit gnash gnash is a software application designed to play content distributed in the adobe flash format this has been marked as a priority project by gnu because it was seen that many people were installing a free software operating system and using a free software web browser but were then also installing the proprietary software plug in from adobe edit recognition in 2001 the gnu project received the usenix lifetime achievement award for the ubiquity breadth and quality of its freely available redistributable and modifiable software which has enabled a generation of research and commercial development 33 edit see also free software portal gnu free documentation license list of gnu software 9965 gnu edit references what
