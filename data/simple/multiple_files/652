xml for analysis abbreviated as xmla is an industry standard for data access in analytical systems such as olap and data mining xmla is based on other industry standards such as xml soap and http xmla is maintained by xmla council with microsoft hyperion and sas being the official xmla council founder members 1 contents 1 history 2 api 2 1 execute 2 2 discover 3 query language 4 example 5 session management 6 products 6 1 xmla providers 6 2 xmla libraries 7 references 8 external links edit history the xmla specification was first proposed by microsoft as a successor for ole db for olap in april 2000 by january 2001 it was joined by hyperion endorsing xmla the 1 0 version of the standard was released in april 2001 and in september 2001 the xmla council was formed in april 2002 sas joined microsoft and hyperion as founding member of xmla council 2 with time more than 25 companies joined with their support for the standard edit api xmla consists of only two soap methods 3 it was designed in such a way to preserve simplicity execute discover edit execute execute method has two parameters command command to be executed it can be mdx dmx or sql properties xml list of command properties such as timeout catalog name etc the result of execute command could be multidimensional dataset or tabular rowset edit discover discover method was designed to model all the discovery methods possible in oledb including various schema rowset properties keywords etc discover method allows users to specify both what needs to be discovered and the possible restrictions or properties the result of discover method is a rowset edit query language xmla specifies mdxml as the query language in the xmla 1 1 version the only construct in mdxml is an mdx statement enclosed in the lt statement gt tag 4 edit example below is an example of xmla execute request with mdx query in command lt soap envelope gt lt soap body gt lt execute xmlns urn schemas microsoft com xml analysis gt lt command gt lt statement gt select measures members on columns from sales lt statement gt lt command gt lt properties gt lt propertylist gt lt datasourceinfo gt lt catalog gt foodmart lt catalog gt lt format gt multidimensional lt format gt lt axisformat gt tupleformat lt axisformat gt lt propertylist gt lt properties gt lt execute gt lt soap body gt lt soap envelope gt edit session management xmla has a notion of session state it is maintained through predefined soap headers beginsession to begin a new session endsession to end existing session usesession to use existing session sessionid attribute previously returned for beginsession should be used edit products products which support xmla fall into three categories xmla providers these products provide xmla service typically these are server or middle tier products xmla consumers these products can connect to xmla providers and consume xmla typically these are client ui products xmla libraries libraries implementing xmla protocol client side allowing to develop xmla consumers without taking care of xmla protocol details edit xmla providers activepivot hyperion essbase ibm infosphere warehouse cubing services 5 iccube
