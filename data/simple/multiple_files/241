gis redirects here for other uses see gis disambiguation geographic information system gis is a system designed to capture store manipulate analyze manage and present all types of geographical data the acronym gis is sometimes used for geographical information science or geospatial information studies to refer to the academic discipline or career of working with geographic information systems 1 in the simplest terms gis is the merging of cartography statistical analysis and database technology a gis can be thought of as a system it digitally creates and manipulates spatial areas that may be jurisdictional purpose or application oriented generally a gis is custom designed for an organization hence a gis developed for an application jurisdiction enterprise or purpose may not be necessarily interoperable or compatible with a gis that has been developed for some other application jurisdiction enterprise or purpose what goes beyond a gis is a spatial data infrastructure a concept that has no such restrictive boundaries in a general sense the term describes any information system that integrates stores edits analyzes shares and displays geographic information for informing decision making gis applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries user created searches analyze spatial information edit data in maps and present the results of all these operations 2

attached to many operations in engineering planning management transport logistics and analysis edit history of development one of the first applications of spatial analysis in epidemiology is the 1832 rapport sur la marche et les effets du chol ra dans paris et le d partement de la seine 4 the french geographer charles picquet represented the 48 160 districts of the city of paris by halftone color gradient according to the percentage of deaths by cholera per 160 1 000 160 inhabitants in 160 1854 john snow depicted a cholera outbreak in london using points to represent the locations of some individual cases possibly the earliest use of a geographic methodology in epidemiology 5 his study of the distribution of cholera led to the source of the disease a contaminated water pump the broad street pump whose handle he disconnected thus terminating the outbreak e w gilbert s version 1958 of john snow s 1855 160 map of the soho cholera outbreak showing the clusters of cholera cases in the london epidemic of 1854 while the basic elements of topography and theme existed previously in cartography the john snow map was unique using cartographic methods not only to depict but also to analyze clusters of geographically dependent phenomena the early 160 20th 160 century saw the development of photozincography which allowed maps to be split into layers for example one layer for vegetation and another for water this was particularly used for printing contours 160 drawing these was a labour intensive task but having them on a separate layer meant they could be worked on without the other layers to confuse the draughtsman this work was originally drawn on glass plates but later plastic film was introduced with the advantages of being lighter using less storage space and being less brittle among others when all the layers were finished they were combined into one image using a large process camera once colour printing came in the layers idea was also used for creating separate printing plates for each colour while the use of layers much later became one of the main typical features of a contemporary gis the photographic process just described is not considered to be a gis in itself 160 as the maps were just images with no database to link them to computer hardware development spurred by nuclear weapon research led to general purpose computer mapping applications by the early 1960s 6 the year 1960 saw the development of the world s first true operational gis in ottawa ontario canada by the federal department of forestry and rural development developed by dr roger tomlinson it was called the canada geographic information system 160 cgis and was used to store analyze and manipulate data collected for the canada land inventory 160 an effort to determine the land capability for rural canada by mapping information about soils agriculture recreation wildlife waterfowl forestry and land use at a scale of 1 50 000 a rating classification factor was also added to permit analysis cgis was an improvement over computer mapping applications as it provided capabilities for overlay measurement and digitizing scanning it supported a national coordinate system that spanned the continent coded lines as arcs having a true embedded topology and it stored the attribute and locational information in separate files as a result of this tomlinson has become known as the father of gis particularly for his use of overlays in promoting the spatial analysis of convergent geographic data 7 cgis lasted into the 1990s and built a large digital land resource database in canada it was developed as a mainframe based system in support of federal and provincial resource planning and management its strength was continent wide analysis of complex datasets the cgis was never available commercially in 160 1964 howard t fisher formed the laboratory for computer graphics and spatial analysis at the harvard graduate school of design lcgsa 1965 1991 where a number of important theoretical concepts in spatial data handling were developed and which by the 1970s had distributed seminal software code and systems such as symap grid and odyssey 160 that served as sources for subsequent commercial development to universities research centers and corporations worldwide 8 by the early 1980s m amp s computing later intergraph along with bentley systems incorporated for the cad 160 platform environmental systems research institute esri caris 160 computer aided resource information system mapinfo mapinfo and erdas 160 earth resource data analysis system emerged as commercial vendors of gis 160 software successfully incorporating many of the cgis 160 features combining the first generation approach to separation of spatial and attribute information with a second generation approach to organizing attribute data into database structures in parallel the development of two public domain systems moss and grass gis began in the late 160 1970s and early 160 1980s 9 in 1986 mapping display and analysis system midas the first desktop gis product emerged for the dos operating system this was renamed in 1990 to mapinfo for windows when it was ported to the microsoft windows platform this began the process of moving gis from the research department into the business environment by the end of the 20th 160 century the rapid growth in various systems had been consolidated and standardized on relatively few platforms and users were beginning to explore viewing gis 160 data over the internet requiring data format and transfer standards more recently a growing number of free open source gis packages run on a range of operating systems and can be customized to perform specific tasks increasingly geospatial data and mapping applications are being made available via the world wide web 10 several authoritative articles on the history of gis have been published 11 12 edit gis techniques and technology modern gis technologies use digital information for which various digitized data creation methods are used the most common method of data creation is digitization where a hard copy map or survey plan is transferred into a digital medium through the use of a cad program and geo referencing capabilities with the wide availability of ortho rectified imagery both from satellite and aerial sources heads up digitizing is becoming the main avenue through which geographic data is extracted heads up digitizing involves the tracing of geographic data directly on top of the aerial imagery instead of by the traditional method of tracing the geographic form on a separate digitizing tablet heads down digitizing edit relating information from different sources gis uses spatio temporal space time location as the key index variable for all other information just as a relational database containing text or numbers can relate many different tables using common key index variables gis can relate unrelated information by using location as the key index variable the key is the location and or extent in space time any variable that can be located spatially and increasingly also temporally can be referenced using a gis locations or extents in earth space time may be recorded as dates times of occurrence and x y and z coordinates representing longitude latitude and elevation respectively these gis coordinates may represent other quantified systems of temporo spatial reference for example film frame number stream gage station highway mile marker surveyor benchmark building address street intersection entrance gate water depth sounding pos or cad drawing origin units units applied to recorded temporal spatial data can vary widely even when using exactly the same data see map projections but all earth based spatial temporal location and extent references should ideally be relatable to one another and ultimately to a real physical location or extent in space time related by accurate spatial information an incredible variety of real world and projected past or future data can be analyzed interpreted and represented to facilitate education and decision making 13 this key characteristic of gis has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry into behaviors and patterns of previously considered unrelated real world information edit gis uncertainties gis accuracy depends upon source data and how it is encoded to be data referenced land surveyors have been able to provide a high level of positional accuracy utilizing the gps derived positions 14 high resolution digital terrain and aerial imagery 15 powerful computers and web technology are changing the quality utility and expectations of gis to serve society on a grand scale but nevertheless there are other source data that have an impact on overall gis accuracy like paper maps though these may be of limited use in achieving the desired accuracy since the aging of maps affects their dimensional stability in developing a digital topographic data base for a gis topographical maps are the main source of aerial photography and satellite images are extra sources for collecting data and identifying attributes which can be mapped in layers over a location facsimile of scale the scale of a map and geographical rendering area representation type are very important aspects since the information content depends mainly on the scale set and resulting locatability of the map s representations in order to digitize a map the map has to be checked within theoretical dimensions then scanned into a raster format and resulting raster data has to be given a theoretical dimension by a rubber sheeting warping technology process a quantitative analysis of maps brings accuracy issues into focus the electronic and other equipment used to make measurements for gis is far more precise than the machines of conventional map analysis 16 all geographical data are inherently inaccurate and these inaccuracies will propagate through gis 160 operations in ways that are difficult to predict edit data representation main article gis file formats gis data represents real objects such as roads land use elevation trees waterways etc with digital data determining the mix real objects can be divided into two abstractions discrete objects e g a house and continuous fields such as rainfall amount or elevations traditionally there are two broad methods used to store data in a gis for both kinds of abstractions mapping references raster images and vector points lines and polygons are the stuff of mapped location attribute references a new hybrid method of storing data is that of identifying point clouds which combine three dimensional points with rgb information at each point returning a 3d color image gis thematic maps then are becoming more and more realistically visually descriptive of what they set out to show or determine edit data capture example of hardware for mapping gps and laser rangefinder and data collection rugged computer the current trend for geographical information system gis is that accurate mapping and data analysis are completed while in the field depicted hardware field map technology is used mainly for forest inventories monitoring and mapping data capture entering information into the system consumes much of the time of gis 160 practitioners there are a variety of methods used to enter data into a gis where it is stored in a digital format existing data printed on paper or pet film maps can be digitized or scanned to produce digital data a digitizer produces vector data as an operator traces points lines and polygon boundaries from a map scanning a map results in raster data that could be further processed to produce vector data survey data can be directly entered into a gis from digital data collection systems on survey instruments using a technique called coordinate geometry cogo positions from a global navigation satellite system gnss like global positioning system can also be collected and then imported into a gis a current trend in data collection gives users the ability to utilize field computers with the ability to edit live data using wireless connections or disconnected editing sessions this has been enhanced by the availability of low cost mapping grade gps units with decimeter accuracy in real time this eliminates the need to post process import and update the data in the office after fieldwork has been collected this includes the ability to incorporate positions collected using a laser rangefinder new technologies also allow users to create maps as well as analysis directly in the field making projects more efficient and mapping more accurate remotely sensed data also plays an important role in data collection and consist of sensors attached to a platform sensors include cameras digital scanners and lidar while platforms usually consist of aircraft and satellites recently with the development of miniature uavs aerial data collection is becoming possible at much lower costs and on a more frequent basis for example the aeryon scout was used to map a 50 acre 160 area with a ground sample distance of 1 inch 2 54 160 cm in only 12 160 minutes 17 the majority of digital data currently comes from photo interpretation of aerial photographs soft copy workstations are used to digitize features directly from stereo pairs of digital photographs these systems allow data to be captured in two and three dimensions with elevations measured directly from a stereo pair using principles of photogrammetry analog aerial photos must be scanned before being entered into a soft copy system for high quality digital cameras step is skipped satellite remote sensing provides another important source of spatial data here satellites use different sensor packages to passively measure the reflectance from parts of the electromagnetic spectrum or radio waves that were sent out from an active sensor such as radar remote sensing collects raster data that can be further processed using different bands to identify objects and classes of interest such as land cover when data is captured the user should consider if the data should be captured with either a relative accuracy or absolute accuracy since this could not only influence how information will be interpreted but also the cost of data capture after entering data into a gis the data usually requires editing to remove errors or further processing for vector data it must be made topologically correct before it can be used for some advanced analysis for example in a road network lines must connect with nodes at an intersection errors such as undershoots and overshoots must also be removed for scanned maps blemishes on the source map may need to be removed from the resulting raster for example a fleck of dirt might connect two lines that should not be connected edit raster to vector translation data restructuring can be performed by a gis to convert data into different formats for example a gis may be used to convert a satellite image map to a vector structure by generating lines around all cells with the same classification while determining the cell spatial relationships such as adjacency or inclusion more advanced data processing can occur with image processing a technique developed in the late 160 1960s by nasa and the private sector to provide contrast enhancement false colour rendering and a variety of other techniques including use of two dimensional fourier transforms since digital data is collected and stored in various ways the two data sources may not be entirely compatible so a gis must be able to convert geographic data from one structure to another edit projections coordinate systems and registration main article map projection the earth can be represented by various models each of which may provide a different set of coordinates e g latitude longitude elevation for any given point on the earth s surface the simplest model is to assume the earth is a perfect sphere as more measurements of the earth have accumulated the models of the earth have become more sophisticated and more accurate in fact there are models called datums that apply to different areas of the earth to provide increased accuracy like nad27 for u s measurements and the world geodetic system for worldwide measurements edit spatial analysis with gis gis spatial analysis is a rapidly changing field and gis packages are increasingly including analytical tools as standard built in facilities as optional toolsets as add ins or analysts in many instances these are provided by the original software suppliers commercial vendors or collaborative non commercial development teams whilst in other cases facilities have been developed and are provided by third parties furthermore many products offer software development kits sdks programming languages and language support scripting facilities and or special interfaces for developing one s own analytical tools or variants the website geospatial analysis and associated book ebook attempt to provide a reasonably comprehensive guide to the subject 18 the increased availability has created a new dimension to business intelligence termed spatial intelligence which when openly delivered via intranet democratizes access to geographic and social network data gis spatial analysis has also become a key element for security intelligence geoint edit slope and aspect slope can be defined as the steepness or gradient of a unit of terrain usually measured as an angle in degrees or as a percentage aspect can be defined as the direction in which a unit of terrain faces aspect is usually expressed in degrees from north slope aspect and surface curvature in terrain analysis are all derived from neighborhood operations using elevation values of a cell s adjacent neighbours 19 slope is a function of resolution and the spatial resolution used to calculate slope and aspect should always be specified 20 authors such as skidmore 21 jones 22 and zhou and liu 23 have compared techniques for calculating slope and aspect the following method can be used to derive slope and aspect the elevation at a point or unit of terrain will have perpendicular tangents slope passing through the point in an east west and north south direction these two tangents give two components z x and z y which then be used to determine the overall direction of slope and the aspect of the slope the gradient is defined as a vector quantity with components equal to the partial derivatives of the surface in the x and y directions 24 the calculation of the overall 3x3 grid slope s and aspect a for methods that determine east west and north south component use the following formulas respectively zhou and liu 23 describe another algorithm for calculating aspect as follows edit data analysis it is difficult to relate wetlands maps to rainfall amounts recorded at different points such as airports television stations and high schools a gis however can be used to depict two and three dimensional characteristics of the earth s surface subsurface and atmosphere from information points for example a gis can quickly generate a map with isopleth or contour lines that indicate differing amounts of rainfall such a map can be thought of as a rainfall contour map many sophisticated methods can estimate the characteristics of surfaces from a limited number of point measurements a two dimensional contour map created from the surface modeling of rainfall point measurements may be overlaid and analyzed with any other map in a gis covering the same area this gis derived map can then provide additional information such as the viability of water power potential as a renewable energy source similarly gis can be used compare other renewable energy resources to find the best geographic potential for a region 25 additionally from a series of three dimensional points or digital elevation model isopleth lines representing elevation contours can be generated along with slope analysis shaded relief and other elevation products watersheds can be easily defined for any given reach by computing all of the areas contiguous and uphill from any given point of interest similarly an expected thalweg of where surface water would want to travel in intermittent and permanent streams can be computed from elevation data in the gis edit topological modeling a gis can recognize and analyze the spatial relationships that exist within digitally stored spatial data these topological relationships allow complex spatial modelling and analysis to be performed topological relationships between geometric entities traditionally include adjacency what adjoins what containment what encloses what and proximity how close something is to something else edit geometric networks geometric networks are linear networks of objects that can be used to represent interconnected features and to perform special spatial analysis on them a geometric network is composed of edges which are connected at junction points similar to graphs in mathematics and computer science just like graphs networks can have weight and flow assigned to its edges which can be used to represent various interconnected features more accurately geometric networks are often used to model road networks and public utility networks such as electric gas and water networks network modeling is also commonly employed in transportation planning hydrology modeling and infrastructure modeling edit hydrological modeling gis hydrological models can provide a spatial element that other hydrological models lack with the analysis of variables such as slope aspect and watershed or catchment area 26 terrain analysis is fundamental to hydrology since water always flows down a slope 26 as basic terrain analysis of a digital elevation model dem involves calculation of slope and aspect dems are very useful for hydrological analysis slope and aspect can then be used to determine direction of surface runoff and hence flow accumulation for the formation of streams rivers and lakes areas of divergent flow can also give a clear indication of the boundaries of a catchment once a flow direction and accumulation matrix has been created queries can be performed that show contributing or dispersal areas at a certain point 26 more detail can be added to the model such as terrain roughness vegetation types and soil types which can influence infiltration and evapotranspiration rates and hence influencing surface flow one of the main uses of hydrological modeling is in environmental contamination research edit cartographic modeling an example of use of layers in a gis application in this example the forest cover layer light green is at the bottom with the topographic layer over it next up is the stream layer then the boundary layer then the road layer the order is very important in order to properly display the final result note that the pond layer was located just below the stream layer so that a stream line can be seen overlying one of the ponds the term cartographic modeling was probably coined by dana tomlin in his phd dissertation and later in his book which has the term in the title cartographic modeling refers to a process where several thematic layers of the same area are produced processed and analyzed tomlin used raster layers but the overlay method see below can be used more generally operations on map layers can be combined into algorithms and eventually into simulation or optimization models edit map overlay the combination of several spatial datasets points lines or polygons creates a new output vector dataset visually similar to stacking several maps of the same region these overlays are similar to mathematical venn diagram overlays a union overlay combines the geographic features and attribute tables of both inputs into a single new output an intersect overlay defines the area where both inputs overlap and retains a set of attribute fields for each a symmetric difference overlay defines an output area that includes the total area of both inputs except for the overlapping area data extraction is a gis process similar to vector overlay though it can be used in either vector or raster data analysis rather than combining the properties and features of both datasets data extraction involves using a clip or mask to extract the features of one data set that fall within the spatial extent of another dataset in raster data analysis the overlay of datasets is accomplished through a process known as local operation on multiple rasters or map algebra through a function that combines the values of each raster s matrix this function may weigh some inputs more than others through use of an index model that reflects the influence of various factors upon a geographic phenomenon edit geostatistics main article geostatistics geostatistics is a branch of statistics that deals with field data spatial data with a continuous index it provides methods to model spatial correlation and predict values at arbitrary locations interpolation when phenomena are measured the observation methods dictate the accuracy of any subsequent analysis due to the nature of the data e g traffic patterns in an urban environment weather patterns over the pacific ocean a constant or dynamic degree of precision is always lost in the measurement this loss of precision is determined from the scale and distribution of the data collection to determine the statistical relevance of the analysis an average is determined so that points gradients outside of any immediate measurement can be included to determine their predicted behavior this is due to the limitations of the applied statistic and data collection methods and interpolation is required to predict the behavior of particles points and locations that are not directly measurable hillshade model derived from a digital elevation model of the valestra area in the northern apennines italy interpolation is the process by which a surface is created usually a raster dataset through the input of data collected at a number of sample points there are several forms of interpolation each which treats the data differently depending on the properties of the data set in comparing interpolation methods the first consideration should be whether or not the source data will change exact or approximate next is whether the method is subjective a human interpretation or objective then there is the nature of transitions between points are they abrupt or gradual finally there is whether a method is global it uses the entire data set to form the model or local where an algorithm is repeated for a small section of terrain interpolation is a justified measurement because of a spatial autocorrelation principle that recognizes that data collected at any position will have a great similarity to or influence of those locations within its immediate vicinity digital elevation models triangulated irregular networks edge finding algorithms thiessen polygons fourier analysis weighted moving averages inverse distance weighting kriging spline and trend surface analysis are all mathematical methods to produce interpolative data edit address geocoding main article geocoding geocoding is interpolating spatial locations x y coordinates from street addresses or any other spatially referenced data such as zip 160 codes parcel lots and address locations a reference theme is required to geocode individual addresses such as a road centerline file with address ranges the individual address locations have historically been interpolated or estimated by examining address ranges along a road segment these are usually provided in the form of a table or database the software will then place a dot approximately where that address belongs along the segment of centerline for example an address point of 500 will be at the midpoint of a line segment that starts with address 160 1 and ends with address 160 1 000 geocoding can also be applied against actual parcel data typically from municipal tax maps in this case the result of the geocoding will be an actually positioned space as opposed to an interpolated point this approach is being increasingly used to provide more precise location information edit reverse geocoding reverse geocoding is the process of returning an estimated street address number as it relates to a given coordinate for example a user can click on a road centerline theme thus providing a coordinate and have information returned that reflects the estimated house number this house number is interpolated from a range assigned to that road segment if the user clicks at the midpoint of a segment that starts with address 160 1 and ends with 160 100 the returned value will be somewhere near 50 note that reverse geocoding does not return actual addresses only estimates of what should be there based on the predetermined range edit multiple criteria decision analysis coupled with gis multi criteria decision analysis methods support decision makers in analysing a set of alternative spatial solutions such as the most likely ecological habitat for restoration against multiple criteria such as vegetation cover or roads mcda uses decision rules to aggregate the criteria which allows the alternative solutions to be ranked or prioritised 27 gis mcda may reduce costs and time involved in identifying potential restoration sites edit data output and cartography cartography is the design and production of maps or visual representations of spatial data the vast majority of modern cartography is done with the help of computers usually using gis but production quality cartography is also achieved by importing layers into a design program to refine it most gis 160 software gives the user substantial control over the appearance of the data cartographic work serves two major functions first it produces graphics on the screen or on paper that convey the results of analysis to the people who make decisions about resources wall maps and other graphics can be generated allowing the viewer to visualize and thereby understand the results of analyses or simulations of potential events web map servers facilitate distribution of generated maps through web browsers using various implementations of web based application programming interfaces ajax java flash etc second other database information can be generated for further analysis or use an example would be a list of all addresses within one 160 mile 1 6 160 km of a toxic spill edit graphic display techniques traditional maps are abstractions of the real world a sampling of important elements portrayed on a sheet of paper with symbols to represent physical objects people who use maps must interpret these symbols topographic maps show the shape of land surface with contour lines or with shaded relief today graphic display techniques such as shading based on altitude in a gis can make relationships among map elements visible heightening one s ability to extract and analyze information for example two types of data were combined in a gis to produce a perspective view of a portion of san 160 mateo county california the digital elevation model consisting of surface elevations recorded on a 30 meter horizontal grid shows high elevations as white and low elevation as black the accompanying landsat thematic mapper image shows a false color infrared image looking down at the same area in 30 meter 160 pixels or picture elements for the same coordinate points pixel 160 by 160 pixel as the elevation information a gis was used to register and combine the two images to render the three dimensional perspective view looking down the san andreas fault using the thematic mapper image pixels but shaded using the elevation of the landforms the gis 160 display depends on the viewing point of the observer and time of day of the display to properly render the shadows created by the sun s rays at that latitude longitude and time of day an archeochrome is a new way of displaying spatial data it is a thematic on a 3d 160 map that is applied to a specific building or a part of a building it is suited to the visual display of heat loss data edit spatial etl spatial etl tools provide the data processing functionality of traditional extract transform load 160 etl software but with a primary focus on the ability to manage spatial data they provide gis 160 users with the ability to translate data between different standards and proprietary formats whilst geometrically transforming the data en route these tools can come in the form of add ins to existing wider purpose software such as microsoft excel edit gis data mining gis or spatial data mining is the application of data mining methods to spatial data data mining which is the partially automated search for hidden patterns in large databases offers great potential benefits for applied gis based 160 decision 160 making typical applications including environmental monitoring a characteristic of such applications is that spatial correlation between data measurements require the use of specialized algorithms for more efficient data analysis 28 edit gis developments geabios tiny wms wfs client flash dhtml many disciplines can benefit from gis 160 technology an active gis 160 market has resulted in lower costs and continual improvements in the hardware and software components of gis these developments will in turn result in a much wider use of the technology original research throughout science government business and industry with applications including real estate public health crime mapping national defense sustainable development natural resources landscape architecture archaeology regional and community planning transportation and logistics gis is also diverging into location based services which allows gps enabled mobile devices to display their location in relation to fixed assets nearest restaurant gas station fire hydrant mobile assets friends children police 160 car or to relay their position back to a central server for display or other processing these services continue to develop with the increased integration of gps functionality with increasingly powerful mobile electronics cell 160 phones pdas laptops 29 edit ogc standards main article open geospatial consortium the open geospatial consortium is an international industry consortium of 384 160 companies government agencies universities and individuals participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available geoprocessing specifications open interfaces and protocols defined by opengis 160 specifications support interoperable solutions that geo enable the web wireless and location based services and mainstream 160 it and empower technology developers to make complex spatial information and services accessible and useful with all kinds of applications open geospatial consortium protocols include web map service and web feature service 30 gis 160 products are broken down by the 160 ogc into two categories based on how completely and accurately the software follows the ogc 160 specifications ogc standards help gis tools communicate compliant products are software products that comply to ogc s 160 opengis 160 specifications when a product has been tested and certified as compliant through the ogc 160 testing program the product is automatically registered as compliant on this site implementing products are software products that implement opengis 160 specifications but have not yet passed a compliance test compliance tests are not available for all specifications developers can register their products as implementing draft or approved specifications though ogc 160 reserves the right to review and verify each entry edit web mapping main article web mapping in recent years there has been an explosion of mapping applications on the web such as google 160 maps and bing 160 maps these websites give the public access to huge amounts of geographic data some of them like google maps and openlayers expose an api that enable users to create custom applications these toolkits commonly offer street maps aerial satellite imagery geocoding searches and routing functionality web mapping has also uncovered the potential of crowdsourcing geodata in projects like openstreetmap which is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world edit global climate change climate history program and prediction of its impact maps have traditionally been used to explore the earth and to exploit its resources gis 160 technology as an expansion of cartographic science has enhanced the efficiency and analytic power of traditional mapping now as the scientific community recognizes the environmental consequences of anthropogenic activities influencing climate change gis 160 technology is becoming an essential tool to understand the impacts of this change over time 31 gis enables the combination of various sources of data with existing maps and up to date information from earth observation satellites along with the outputs of climate change models this can help in understanding the effects of climate change on complex natural systems one of the classic examples of this is the study of arctic ice melting edit adding the dimension of time the condition of the earth s surface atmosphere and subsurface can be examined by feeding satellite data into a gis gis 160 technology gives researchers the ability to examine the variations in earth processes over days months and years as an example the changes in vegetation vigor through a growing season can be animated to determine when drought was most extensive in a particular region the resulting graphic known as a normalized vegetation index represents a rough measure of plant health working with two variables over time would then allow researchers to detect regional differences in the lag between a decline in rainfall and its effect on vegetation gis 160 technology and the availability of digital data on regional and global scales enable such analyses the satellite sensor output used to generate a vegetation graphic is produced for example by the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr this sensor system detects the amounts of energy reflected from the earth s surface across various bands of the spectrum for surface areas of about 1 square kilometer the satellite sensor produces images of a particular location on the earth twice a day avhrr and more recently the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis are only two of many sensor systems used for earth surface analysis more sensors will follow generating ever greater amounts of data in addition to the integration of time in environmental studies gis is also being explored for its ability to track and model the progress of humans throughout their daily routines a concrete example of progress in this area is the recent release of time specific population data by the u s 160 census in this data set the populations of cities are shown for daytime and evening hours highlighting the pattern of concentration and dispersion generated by north american commuting patterns the manipulation and generation of data required to produce this data would not have been possible without 160 gis using models to project the data held by a gis 160 forward in time have enabled planners to test policy decisions using spatial decision support systems edit semantics tools and technologies emerging from the w3c s semantic web activity are proving useful for data integration problems in information systems correspondingly such technologies have been proposed as a means to facilitate interoperability and data reuse among gis 160 applications 32 33 and also to enable new analysis mechanisms 34 ontologies are a key component of this semantic approach as they allow a formal machine readable specification of the concepts and relationships in a given domain this in turn allows a gis to focus on the intended meaning of data rather than its syntax or structure for example reasoning that a land cover type classified as deciduous needleleaf trees in one dataset is a specialization or subset of land cover type forest in another more roughly classified dataset can help a gis automatically merge the two datasets under the more general land cover classification tentative ontologies have been developed in areas related to gis 160 applications for example the hydrology ontology developed by the ordnance survey in the united kingdom and the sweet ontologies developed by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory geosparql is a simple ontology for ogc standards literals and topological relationships developed by the ordnance survey usgs and others also simpler ontologies and semantic metadata standards are being proposed by the w3c geo incubator group to represent geospatial data on
