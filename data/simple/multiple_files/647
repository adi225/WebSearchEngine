an answer engine developed by wolfram research it is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine might 4 wolfram alpha is based on the computational platform mathematica written by british scientist stephen wolfram in 1988 5 wolfram alpha was announced in march 2009 and subsequently released on may 15 2009 1 contents 1 overview 2 technology 3 licensing partners 4 history 5 wolfram alpha pro 6 criticism 7 references 8 further reading 9 external links edit overview users submit queries and computation requests via a text field wolfram alpha then computes answers and relevant visualizations from a knowledge base of curated structured data alpha thus differs from semantic search engines which index a large number of answers and then try to match the question to one wolfram alpha is built on wolfram s earlier flagship product mathematica which encompasses computer algebra symbolic and numerical computation visualization and statistics capabilities the answer usually presents a human readable solution wolfram has said of the engine all one needs to be able to do is to take questions people ask in natural language and represent them in a precise form that fits into the computations one can do 5 wolfram alpha is capable of responding to particularly phrased natural language fact based questions such as where was mary robinson born or more complex questions such as how old was queen elizabeth ii in 1974 it displays its input interpretation of such a question using standardized phrases such as age of queen elizabeth ii royalty in 1974 the answer of which is age at start of 1974 47 years and a biography link wolfram alpha does not answer queries which require a narrative response such as what is the difference between the julian and the gregorian calendars but will answer factual or computational questions such as june 1 in julian calendar mathematical symbolism can be parsed by the engine which typically responds with more than the numerical results for example lim x gt 0 sin x x yields the expected result 1 as well as a possible derivation using l h pital s rule a plot and the series expansion it is also able to perform calculations on data using more than one source for example what is the fifty second smallest country by gdp per capita yields nicaragua 1160 per year edit technology wolfram alpha is written in 15 million lines of mathematica code 6 and runs on more than 10 000 cpus 7 8 the database currently includes hundreds of datasets such as all current and historical weather the datasets have been accumulated over several years 9 as well as its own built in database wolfram alpha also answers queries based on live data from external sources such as facebook 10 crunchbase 11 best buy golson jordan december 16 2011 wolfram delivers siri enabled shopping results from best

were broadcast live on justin tv the plan was to publicly launch the service a few hours later with expected issues due to extreme load the service was officially launched on may 18 2009 16 wolfram alpha has received mixed reviews 17 18 wolfram alpha advocates point to its potential some even stating that how it determines results is more important than current usefulness 17 on december 3 2009 an iphone app was introduced some users 19 considered the initial 50 price of the ios app unnecessarily high since the same features could be freely accessed by using a web browser instead they also complained about the simultaneous removal of the mobile formatting option for the site 20 wolfram responded by lowering the price to 2 offering a refund to existing customers 21 and re instating the mobile site on october 6 2010 an android version of the app was released 22 and it is now available for kindle fire and nook a further 71 apps are available which use the wolfram alpha engine for specialized tasks 23 edit wolfram alpha pro on february 8 2012 wolfram alpha pro was released 24 offering users additional features for a monthly subscription fee a key feature is the ability to upload many common file types and data including raw tabular data images audio xml and dozens of specialized scientific medical and mathematical formats for automatic analysis other features include an extended keyboard interactivity with cdf data downloads the ability to customize and save graphical and tabular results 25 and extra computation time 24 edit criticism infoworld published an article 26 warning readers of the potential implications of giving an automated website proprietary rights to the data it generates free software advocate richard stallman also opposes the idea of recognizing the site as a copyright holder and suspects that wolfram would not be able to make this case under existing copyright law 27 edit references a b the wolfram alpha launch team may 8 2009 so
