the extended boolean model was described in a communications of the acm article appearing in 1983 by gerard salton edward a fox and harry wu the goal of the extended boolean model is to overcome the drawbacks of the boolean model that has been used in information retrieval the boolean model doesn t consider term weights in queries and the result set of a boolean query is often either too small or too big the idea of the extended model is to make use of partial matching and term weights as in the vector space model it combines the characteristics of the vector space model with the properties of boolean algebra and ranks the similarity between queries and documents this way a document may be somewhat relevant if it matches some of the queried terms and will be returned as a result whereas in the standard boolean model it wasn t 1 thus the extended boolean model can be considered as a generalization of both the boolean and vector space models those two are special cases if suitable settings and definitions are employed further research has shown effectiveness improves relative to that for boolean query processing other research has shown that relevance feedback and query expansion can be integrated with extended boolean query processing contents 1 definitions 2 the 2 dimensions example 3 generalizing the idea and p norms 4 examples 5 improvements over the standard boolean model 6 further reading 7 see also 8 references edit definitions in the extended boolean model a document is represented as a vector similarly to in the vector model each i dimension corresponds to a separate term associated with the document the weight of term k x associated with document d j is measured by its normalized term frequency and can be defined as where idf x is inverse document frequency the weight vector associated with document d j can be represented as edit the 2 dimensions example figure 1 the similarities of q k x k y with documents d j and d j 1 figure 2 the similarities of q k x k y with documents d j and d j 1 considering the space composed of two terms k x and k y only the corresponding term weights are w 1 and w 2 2 thus for query q or k x k y we can calculate the similarity with the following formula for query q and k x k y we can use edit generalizing the idea and p norms we can generalize the previous 2d extended boolean model example to higher t dimensional space using euclidean distances this can be done using p norms which extends the notion of distance to include p distances where 1 p is a new parameter 3 a generalized conjunctive query is given by the similarity of and can be defined as a generalized disjunctive query is given by the similarity of and can be defined as edit examples consider the query q k 1 k 2 k 3 the similarity between query q and document d can be computed using the formula edit improvements over the standard boolean model lee and fox 4 compared the standard and extended boolean models with three test collections cisi cacm and inspec using p norms they obtained an average precision improvement of 79 106 and 210 over the standard model for the cisi cacm and inspec collections respectively the p norm model is computationally expensive because of the number of exponentiation operations that it requires but it achieves much better results than the standard model and even fuzzy retrieval techniques the standard boolean model is still the most efficient edit further reading adaptive feedback methods in an extended boolean model by dr jongpill choi interpolation of the extended boolean retrieval model fox e s betrabet m koushik w lee 1992 information retrieval algorithms and data structures extended boolean model prentice hall inc http www scribd com doc 13742235 information retrieval data structures algorithms william b frakes skorkovsk lucie pavel ircing 2009 experiments with automatic query formulation in the extended boolean model springer berlin heidelberg http www springerlink com content tk1t141253257613 edit see also information retrieval edit references salton gerard edward a fox harry wu 1983 extended boolean information retrieval communications of the acm volume 26 issue 11 http portal acm org citation cfm id 358466 lusheng wang garcia dr e the extended boolean model weighted queries term weights p norm queries and multiconcept types boolean or extended and that is the query http www miislita com term vector term vector 6 boolean model html lee w c e a fox 1988 experimental comparison of schemes for interpreting boolean queries
