a typical interface for querying a tablebase an endgame tablebase is a computerized database that contains precalculated exhaustive analysis of a chess endgame position it is typically used by a computer chess engine during play or by a human or computer that is retrospectively analysing a game that has already been played the tablebase contains the game theoretical value win loss or draw of each possible move in each possible position and how many moves it would take to achieve that result with perfect play thus the tablebase acts as an oracle always providing the optimal moves typically the database records each possible position with certain pieces remaining on the board and the best moves with white to move and with black to move tablebases are generated by retrograde analysis working backwards from a checkmated position tablebases have solved chess for every position with six or fewer pieces including the two kings the solutions have profoundly advanced the chess community s understanding of endgame theory some positions which humans had analyzed as draws were proved to be winnable the tablebase analysis could find a mate in more than a hundred moves far beyond the horizon of humans and beyond the capability of a computer during play tablebases have enhanced competitive play and facilitated the composition of endgame studies they provide a powerful analytical

computer hardware aside in principle it is possible to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance strong solutions i e algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position 4 are known for some simple games such as tic tac toe draw with perfect play and connect four first player wins weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games such as checkers with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw but it is not known for every position created by less than perfect play what the perfect next move would be other games such as chess from the starting position and go have not been solved because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions to reduce the game complexity researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board or the number of pieces or both computer chess is one of the oldest domains of artificial intelligence having begun in the early 1930s claude shannon proposed formal criteria for evaluating chess moves in 1949 in 1951 alan turing designed a primitive chess playing program which assigned values for material and mobility the program played chess based on turing s manual calculations 5 however even as competent chess programs began to develop they exhibited a glaring weakness in playing the endgame programmers added specific heuristics for the endgame for example the king should move to the center of the board 6 however a more comprehensive solution was needed in 1965 richard bellman proposed the creation of a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis 7 8 instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated thus a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand it would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move in 1970 thomas str hlein published a doctoral thesis 9 10 with analysis of the following classes of endgame kqk krk kpk kqkr krkb and krkn 11 in 1977 the kqkr database was used in a match versus grandmaster walter browne ken thompson and others helped extend tablebases to cover all four and five piece endgames including in particular kbbkn kqpkq and krpkr 12 13 lewis stiller published a thesis with research on some six piece tablebase endgames in 1995 14 15 more recent contributors have included the following people eugene nalimov after whom the popular nalimov tablebases are named eiko bleicher who has adapted the tablebase concept to a program called freezer see below guy haworth an academic at the university of reading who has published extensively in the icga journal and elsewhere marc bourzutschky and yakov konoval who have collaborated to analyze endgames with seven pieces on the board peter karrer who constructed a specialized seven piece tablebase kqppkqp for the endgame of the kasparov versus the world online match vladimir makhnychev and victor zakharov from moscow state university who completed 4 3 dtm tablebases 525 endings including kpppkpp in july 2012 the tablebases are named lomonosov tablebases the next set of 5 2 dtm tablebases 350 endings including kppppkp was completed during august 2012 the high speed of generating the tablebases was because of using a supercomputer named lomonosov top500 the size of seven man tablebases is about 100 tb the tablebases of all endgames with up to six pieces are available for free download and may also be queried using web interfaces see the external links below nalimov tablebase requires more than one terabyte of storage space 16 17 edit

must choose a metric of optimality in other words he must define at what point a player has won the game every position can be defined by its distance i e the number of moves from the desired endpoint two metrics are generally used depth to mate dtm a checkmate is the only way to win a game depth to conversion dtc the stronger side can also win by capturing material thus converting to a simpler endgame for example in kqkr conversion occurs when white captures the black rook haworth has discussed two other metrics namely depth to zeroing move dtz and depth by the rule dtr these metrics support the fifty move rule but dtr tablebases have not yet been computed and dtz tablebases have not yet been generally released to the public 18 the difference between dtc and dtm can be understood by analyzing the diagram at right how white should proceed depends on which metric is used metric play dtc dtm dtc 1 qxd1 kc8 2 qd2 kb8 3 qd8 mate 1 3 dtm 1 qc7 ka8 2 qa7 mate 2 2 according to the dtc metric white should capture the rook because that leads immediately to a position which will certainly win dtc 1 but it will take two more moves actually to checkmate dtm 3 in contrast according to the dtm metric white mates in two moves so dtm dtc 2 this difference is typical of many endgames usually dtc is smaller than dtm but the dtm metric leads to the quickest checkmate exceptions occur where the weaker side has only a king and in the unusual endgame of two knights versus one pawn then dtc dtm because either there is no defending material to capture or capturing the material does no good indeed capturing the defending pawn in the latter endgame results in a draw edit step 1 generating all possible positions david levy how computers play chess a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h the ten unique squares with symmetry a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h the twenty four unique pawn squares with symmetry once a metric is chosen the first step is to generate all the positions with a given material for example to generate a dtm tablebase for the endgame of king and queen versus king kqk the computer must describe approximately 40 000 unique legal positions levy and newborn explain that the number 40 000 derives from a symmetry argument the black king can be placed on any of ten squares a1 b1 c1 d1 b2 c2 d2 c3 d3 and d4 see diagram on any other square its position can be considered equivalent by symmetry of rotation or reflection thus there is no difference whether a black king in a corner resides on a1 a8 h8 or h1 multiply this number of 10 by at most 60 legal remaining squares for placing the white king and then by at most 62 squares for the white queen the product 10 60 62 37 200 several hundred of these positions are illegal impossible or symmetrical reflections of each other so the actual number is somewhat smaller 19 20 for each position the tablebase evaluates the situation separately for white to move and black to move assuming that white has the queen almost all the positions are white wins with checkmate forced in not more than ten moves some positions are draws because of stalemate or the unavoidable loss of the queen each additional piece added to a pawnless endgame multiplies the number of unique positions by about a factor of sixty which is the approximate number of squares not already occupied by other pieces endgames with one or more pawns increase the complexity because the symmetry argument is reduced since pawns can move forward but not sideways rotation and vertical reflection of the board produces a fundamental change in the nature of the position 21 the best calculation of symmetry is achieved by limiting one pawn to 24 squares in the rectangle a2 a7 d7 d2 all other pieces and pawns may be located in any of the 64 squares with respect to the pawn thus an endgame with pawns has a complexity of 24 10 2 4 times a pawnless endgame with the same number of pieces edit step 2 evaluating positions using retrograde analysis tim krabb explains the process of generating a tablebase as follows the idea is that a database is made with all possible positions with a given material note as in the preceding section then a subdatabase is made of all positions where black is mated then one where white can give mate then one where black cannot stop white giving mate next move then one where white can always reach a position where black cannot stop him from giving mate next move and so on always a ply further away from mate until all positions that are thus connected to mate have been found then all of these positions are linked back to mate by the shortest path through the database that means that apart from equi optimal moves all the moves in such a path are perfect white s move always leads to the quickest mate black s move always leads to the slowest mate 22 the retrograde analysis is only necessary from the checkmated positions other positions need not be worked from because every position that is not reached from a checkmated position is a draw 23 figure 1 illustrates the idea of retrograde analysis white mates in two moves with 1 kc6 leading to the position in figure 2 then if 1 kb8 2 qb7 mate and if 1 kd8 2 qd7 mate figure 3 figure 3 before white s second move is defined as mate in one ply figure 2 after white s first move is mate in two ply regardless of how black plays finally the initial position in figure 1 is mate in three ply i e two moves because it leads directly to figure 2 which is already defined as mate in two ply this process which links a current position to another position that could have existed one ply earlier can continue indefinitely each position is evaluated as a win or loss in a certain number of moves at the end of the retrograde analysis positions which are not designated as wins or losses are necessarily draws figure 1 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h white to move mate in three ply kc6 figure 2 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h black to move mate in two ply kd8 or kb8 figure 3 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h white to move mate in one ply qd7 edit step 3 verification after the tablebase has been generated and every position has been evaluated the result must be verified independently the purpose is to check the self consistency of the tablebase results 24 for example in figure 1 above the verification program sees the evaluation mate in three ply kc6 it then looks at the position in figure 2 after kc6 and sees the evaluation mate in two ply these two evaluations are consistent with each other if the evaluation of figure 2 were anything else it would be inconsistent with figure 1 so the tablebase would need to be corrected clarification needed edit captures pawn promotion and special moves a four piece tablebase must rely on three piece tablebases that could result if one piece is captured similarly a tablebase containing a pawn must be able to rely on other tablebases that deal with the new set of material after pawn promotion to a queen or other piece the retrograde analysis program must account for the possibility of a capture or pawn promotion on the previous move 25 tablebases assume that castling is not possible for two reasons first in practical endgames this assumption is almost always correct however castling is allowed by convention in composed problems and studies second if the king and rook are on their original squares castling may or may not be allowed because of this ambiguity it would be necessary to make separate evaluations for states in which castling is or is not possible the same ambiguity exists for the en passant capture since the possibility of en passant depends on the opponent s previous move however practical applications of en passant occur frequently in pawn endgames so tablebases account for the possibility of en passant for positions where both sides have at least one pawn edit using a priori information a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h an example of the krp a2 kbp a3 endgame white mates in 72 moves starting with 1 kh7 other white moves draw according to the method described above the tablebase must allow the possibility that a given piece might occupy any of the 64 squares in some positions it is possible to restrict the search space without affecting the result this saves computational resources and enables searches which would otherwise be impossible an early analysis of this type was published in 1987 in the endgame krp a2 kbp a3 where the black bishop moves on the dark squares see example position at right 26 in this position we can make the following a priori assumptions 1 if a piece is captured we can look up the resulting position in the corresponding tablebase with five pieces for example if the black pawn is captured look up the newly created position in krpkb 2 the white pawn stays on a2 capture moves are handled by the 1st rule 3 the black pawn stays on a3 capture moves are handled by the 1st rule 27 the result of this simplification is that instead of searching for 48 47 2 256 permutations for the pawns locations there is only one permutation reducing the search space by a factor of 2 256 facilitates a much quicker calculation bleicher has designed a commercial program called freezer which allows users to build new tablebases from existing nalimov tablebases with a priori information the program can produce a tablebase for positions with seven or more pieces with blocked pawns even though tablebases for seven or more pieces are generally not available 28 edit applications edit correspondence chess kasparov vs the world 1999 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h the position after 55 qxb4 tablebases tell us white wins in 82 moves in correspondence chess a player may consult a chess computer for assistance provided that the etiquette of the competition allows this a six piece tablebase kqqkqq was used to analyze the endgame that occurred in the correspondence game kasparov versus the world 29 players have also used tablebases to analyze endgames from over the board play after the game is over competitive players need to know that tablebases ignore the fifty move rule according to that rule if fifty moves have passed without a capture or a pawn move either player may claim a draw fide changed the rules several times starting in 1974 to allow one hundred moves for endgames where fifty moves were insufficient to win in 1988 fide allowed seventy five moves for kbbkn knnkp kqkbb kqknn krbkr and kqpkq with the pawn on the seventh rank because tablebases had uncovered positions in these endgames requiring more than fifty moves to win in 1992 fide canceled these exceptions and restored the fifty move rule to its original standing 18 thus a tablebase may identify a position as won or lost when it is in fact drawn by the fifty move rule haworth has designed a tablebase that produces results consistent with the fifty move rule however most tablebases search for the theoretical limits of forced mate even if it requires several hundred moves edit computer chess the knowledge contained in tablebases affords the computer a tremendous advantage in the endgame not only can computers play perfectly within an endgame but they can simplify to a winning tablebase position from a more complicated endgame 30 for the latter purpose some programs use bitbases which give the game theoretical value of positions without the number of moves until conversion or mate that is they only reveal whether the position is won lost or draw sometimes even this data is compressed and the bitbase reveals only whether a position is won or not making no difference between a lost and a drawn game 23 however some computer chess experts have observed practical drawbacks 31 in addition to ignoring the fifty move rule a computer in a difficult position might avoid the losing side of a tablebase ending even if the opponent cannot practically win without himself knowing the tablebase the adverse effect could be a premature resignation or an inferior line of play that loses with less resistance than a play without tablebase might offer another drawback is that tablebases require a lot of memory to store the many thousands of positions the nalimov tablebases which use advanced compression techniques require 7 05 160 gb of hard disk space for all five piece endings the six piece endings require approximately 1 2 160 tb 32 33 it is estimated that seven piece tablebases will require between 50 and 200 tb of storage space 34 shredderbases for example used by the shredder program compress all three four and five piece bases into 157 160 mb this is a mere fraction of the 7 05 160 gb that the nalimov tablebases require 35 some computers play better overall if their memory is devoted instead to the ordinary search and evaluation function modern computers analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases i e without suffering from the horizon effect it is only for more sophisticated positions that the tablebase will improve significantly over the ordinary computer edit endgame theory lewis stiller 1991 a b c d e

tablebases have answered longstanding questions about whether certain combinations of material are wins or draws the following interesting results have emerged kbbkn bernhard horwitz and josef kling 1851 proposed that black can draw by entering a defensive fortress but tablebases demonstrated a general win with maximum dtc 66 or 67 and maximum dtm 78 36 also see pawnless chess endgame knnkp alexey troitsky established this as a win for the knights if the pawn was blocked behind the troitzky line analysis of the tablebases has clarified that even if the pawn has crossed the troitzky line white can sometimes win by forcing zugzwang 37 maximum dtc dtm 115 moves knnnnkq the knights win in 62 5 percent of positions with maximum dtm 85 moves 38 39 kqrkqr despite the equality of material the player to move wins in 67 74 of positions 40 the maximum dtc is 92 and the maximum dtm is 117 in both this endgame and kqqkqq the first player to check usually wins 41 krnknn and krbknn friedrich amelung had analyzed these two endgames in the 1900s 42 krnknn and krbknn are won for the strongest side in 78 and 95 of the cases respectively 22 43 stiller s dtc tablebase revealed several lengthy wins in these endgames the longest win in krbknn has a dtc of 223 and a dtm of 238 moves not shown even more amazing is the position at right where white wins starting with 1 ke6 stiller reported the dtc as 243 moves and the dtm was later found to be 262 moves 44 for some years this position held the record for the longest computer generated forced mate otto blathy had composed a mate in 292 moves problem already in 1889 45 however in may 2006 bourzutschky and konoval discovered a kqnkrbn position with an astonishing dtc of 517 moves this was more than twice as long as stiller s maximum and almost 200 moves beyond the previous record of a 330 dtc for a position of kqbnkqb 1001 bourzutschky wrote this was a big surprise for us and is a great tribute to the complexity of chess 46 47 as was shown later this position is evaluated even as dtm 545 i e black can resist eighteen moves more 48 in august 2006 bourzutschky released preliminary results from his analysis of the following seven

tablebases some studies have been cooked i e proved unsound by the tablebases that can be either because the composer s solution does not work or else because there is an equally effective alternative that the composer did not consider another way tablebases cook studies is a change in the evaluation of an endgame for instance the endgame with a queen and bishop versus two rooks was thought to be a draw but tablebases proved it to be a win for the queen and bishop so almost all studies based on this endgame are unsound 50 for example erik pogosyants composed the study at right with white to play and win his intended main line was 1 ne3 rxh2 2 o o o mate a tablebase discovered that 1 h4 also wins for white in 33 moves even though black can capture the pawn which is not the best move in case of capturing the pawn black loses in 21 moves while kh1 g2 loses in 32 moves coincidentally the tablebase does not recognize the composer s solution because it includes castling 51 while tablebases have cooked some studies they have assisted in the creation of other studies composers can search tablebases for interesting positions such as zugzwang using a method called data mining for all three to five piece endgames and pawnless six piece endgames a complete list of mutual zugzwangs has been tabulated and published 52 53 54 there has been some controversy whether to allow endgame studies composed with tablebase assistance into composing tourneys in 2003 the endgame composer and expert john roycroft summarized the debate n ot only do opinions diverge widely but they are frequently adhered to strongly even vehemently at one extreme is the view that since we can never be certain that a computer has been used it is pointless to attempt a distinction so we should simply evaluate a study on its content without reference to its origins at the other extreme is the view that using a mouse to lift an interesting position from a ready made computer generated list is in no sense composing so we should outlaw every such position 55 roycroft himself agrees with the latter approach he continues one thing alone is clear to us the distinction between classical composing and computer composing should be preserved for as long as possible if there is a name associated with a study diagram that name is a claim of authorship 55 mark dvoretsky an international master chess trainer and author took a more permissive stance he was commenting in 2006 on a study by harold van der heijden published in 2001 which reached the position at right after three introductory moves the drawing move for white is 4 kb4 and not 4 kb5 based on a mutual zugzwang that may occur three moves later dvoretsky comments here we should touch on one delicate question i am sure that this unique endgame position was discovered with the help of thompson s famous computer database is this a flaw diminishing the composer s achievement yes the computer database is an instrument available to anyone nowadays out of it no doubt we could probably extract yet more unique positions there are some chess composers who do so regularly the standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved thus miracles based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes 56 edit play chess with god on the bell labs website ken thompson maintains a link to some of his tablebase data the headline reads play chess with god 57 regarding stiller s long wins tim krabb struck a similar note a grandmaster wouldn t be better at these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday it s a sort of chess that has nothing to do with chess a chess that we could never have imagined without computers the stiller moves are
