congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances background main article anti federalism opposition to the ratification of the constitution was partly based on the constitution s lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties to provide such guarantees the first amendment along with the rest of the bill of rights was submitted to the states for ratification on september 25 1789 and adopted on december 15 1791 establishment of religion main article establishment clause originally the first amendment applied only to the federal government a number of the states effectively had established churches when the first amendment was ratified with some remaining into the early nineteenth century subsequently everson v board of education 1947 incorporated the establishment clause i e made it apply against the states however it was not until the middle to late twentieth century that the supreme court began to interpret the establishment and free exercise clauses in such a manner as to restrict the promotion of religion by the states in the board of education of kiryas joel village school district v grumet 1 justice david souter writing for the majority concluded that government should not prefer one religion to another or religion to irreligion 2 separationists everson used the metaphor of a wall of separation between church and state derived from the correspondence of president thomas jefferson it had been long established in the decisions of the supreme court beginning with reynolds v united states from 1879 when the court reviewed the history of the early republic in deciding the extent of the liberties of mormons chief justice morrison waite who consulted the historian george bancroft also discussed at some length the memorial and remonstrance against religious assessments by james madison who drafted the first amendment madison used the metaphor of a great barrier 3 justice hugo black adopted jefferson s words in the voice of the court and concluded that government must be neutral among religions and nonreligion it cannot promote endorse or fund religion or religious institutions 4 the court has affirmed it often with majority but not unanimous support warren nord in does god make a difference characterized the general tendency of the dissents as a weaker reading of the first amendment the dissents tend to be less concerned about the dangers of establishment and less concerned to protect free exercise rights particularly of religious minorities 5 beginning with the everson decision itself which permitted new jersey school boards to pay for transportation to parochial schools the court has used various tests to determine when the wall of separation has been breached the everson decision laid down the test that establishment existed when aid was given to religion but that the transportation was justifiable because the benefit to the children was more important in the school prayer cases of the early 1960s engel v vitale and abington school district v schempp aid seemed irrelevant the court ruled on the basis that a legitimate action both served a secular purpose and did not primarily assist religion in walz v tax commission the court ruled that a legitimate action could not entangle government with religion in lemon v kurtzman these points were combined declaring that an action was not establishment if the statute or practice has a secular purpose its principal or primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion and it does not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion this lemon test has been criticized by justices and legal scholars but it remains the predominant means by which the court enforces the establishment clause 6 in agostini v felton the entanglement prong of the lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice 7 in zelman v simmons harris the opinion of the court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test 6 accommodationists accommodationists on the other hand read the establishment clause as prohibiting the congress or any state from declaring an official religion or preferring one to another but hold that laws do not have to be shorn of morality and history to be declared constitutional 8 as a result they apply the lemon test only selectively holding justice douglas statement in zorach v clauson w e are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a supreme being 8 9 as such for many conservatives the establishment clause solely prevents the establishing of a state church not from publicly acknowledging god and developing policies that encourage general religious beliefs that do not favor a particular sect and are consistent with the secular government s goals 10 11 free exercise of religion main article free exercise clause in sherbert v verner 12 the supreme court required states to meet the strict scrutiny standard when refusing to accommodate religiously motivated conduct this meant that a government needed to have a compelling interest regarding such a refusal the case involved adele sherbert who was denied unemployment benefits by south carolina because she refused to work on saturdays something forbidden by her seventh day adventist faith in wisconsin v yoder 13 the court ruled that a law that unduly burdens the practice of religion without a compelling interest even though it might be neutral on its face would be unconstitutional the need for a compelling interest was narrowed in employment division v smith 14 which held no such interest was required under the free exercise clause regarding a law that does not target a particular religious practice in church of lukumi babalu aye v city of hialeah 15 the supreme court ruled hialeah had passed an ordinance banning ritual slaughter a practice central to the santer a religion while providing exceptions for some practices such as the kosher slaughter since the ordinance was not generally applicable the court ruled that it needed to have a compelling interest which it failed to have and so was declared unconstitutional in 1993 the congress passed the religious freedom restoration act rfra which sought to restore the compelling interest requirement applied in sherbert and yoder in city of boerne v flores 16 the court struck down the provisions of the act that forced state and local governments to provide protections exceeding those required by the first amendment on the grounds that while the congress could enforce the supreme court s interpretation of a constitutional right the congress could not impose its own interpretation on states and localities according to the court s ruling in gonzales v udv 17 rfra remains applicable to federal laws and so those laws must still have a compelling interest freedom of speech inscription of the first amendment december 15 1791 in front of independence hall in philadelphia main articles freedom of speech in the united states and united states free speech exceptions speech critical of the government the supreme court never ruled on the constitutionality of any federal law regarding the free speech clause until the 20th century the supreme court never ruled on the alien and sedition acts of 1798 whose speech provisions expired in 1801 18 the leading critics of the law thomas jefferson and james madison argued for the acts unconstitutionality based on the first amendment among other constitutional provisions e g tenth amendment 19 in retrospect dicta from new york times co v sullivan 20 acknowledges that a lthough the sedition act was never tested in this court the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history 21 the espionage act of 1917 imposed a maximum sentence of twenty years for anyone who caused or attempted to cause insubordination disloyalty mutiny or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces of the united states over two thousand were convicted under the act one filmmaker was sentenced to ten years imprisonment because his portrayal of british soldiers in a movie about the american revolution impugned the good faith of an american ally the united kingdom 22 the sedition act of 1918 went even further criminalizing disloyal scurrilous or abusive language against the government in the midst of world war i charles schenck then the general secretary of the socialist party was found guilty of violating the espionage act after a search of the socialist headquarters revealed a book of executive committee minutes the book contained a resolution dated august 13 1917 to print 15 000 leaflets to be mailed to men who had passed exemption boards 23 the contents of these leaflets intimated a fervent opposition to the draft comparing conscripts to convicts and urging potential draftees to not submit to intimidation 24 schenck s appeal of his conviction reached the supreme court as schenck v united states 25 according to schenck the espionage act violated the free speech clause of the first amendment the supreme court unanimously rejected schenck s appeal and affirmed his conviction justice oliver wendell holmes jr writing for the court explained that the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that congress has a right to prevent 26 the clear and present danger test of schenck was elaborated in debs v united states 27 on june 16 1918 eugene v debs a political activist delivered a speech in canton ohio the main theme of which was socialism its growth and a prophecy of its ultimate success 28 debs spoke with pride of the devotion with which his most loyal comrades were paying the penalty to the working class these being wagenknecht baker and ruthenberg who had been convicted of aiding and abetting another in failing to register for the draft 29 moreover hours earlier debs had spoken with approval of an anti war proclamation and program adopted at st louis in april 1917 which advocated a continuous active and public opposition to the war through demonstrations mass petitions and all other means within their power 30 following his speech debs was charged and convicted under the espionage act in upholding his conviction the court reasoned that although he had not spoken any words that posed a clear and present danger taken in context the speech had a natural tendency and a probable effect to obstruct the recruiting services 30 benjamin gitlow was convicted of criminal anarchy after he was found advocating the necessity and propriety of overthrowing and overturning organized government by force violence and unlawful means in the left wing manifesto as well as publishing and circulating a radical newspaper called the revolutionary age advocating similar ideas 31 in arguing before the supreme court gitlow contended that the statute as construed and applied by the trial court penalize d the mere utterance as such of doctrine having no quality of incitement without regard to the circumstances of its utterance or to the likelihood of the unlawful sequences 32 while acknowledging liberty of expression is not absolute he maintained it may be restrained only in instances where its exercise bears a causal relation with some substantive evil consummated attempted or likely 32 as the statute took no account of the circumstances under which the offending literature was written it violated the first amendment the court rejected gitlow s reasoning writing for the majority justice edward terry sanford declared that utterances inciting to the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means present a sufficient danger of substantive evil to bring their punishment within the range of legislative discretion such utterances by their very nature involve danger to the public peace and to the security of the state 33 gitlow v new york 34 greatly expanded schenck and debs but established the general opinion of the court that the first amendment is incorporated by the fourteenth amendment to apply to the states 35 in 1940 congress enacted the smith act making it illegal to advocate the propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the united states by force and violence 36 the law provided law enforcement a tool to combat communist leaders after eugene dennis was convicted in the foley square trial for attempting to organize a communist party in the united states pursuant to the smith act 2 he petitioned for certiorari which the supreme court granted 37 in dennis v united states 38 the court upheld the law 6 2 justice tom c clark did not participate because he had ordered the prosecutions when he was attorney general chief justice fred m vinson explicitly relied on oliver wendell holmes jr s clear and present danger test as adapted by learned hand in each case courts must ask whether the gravity of the evil discounted by its improbability justifies such invasion of free speech as necessary to avoid the danger 39 clearly vinson suggested clear and present danger did not intimate that before the government may act it must wait until the putsch is about to be executed the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited 40 dennis has never been explicitly overruled by the court but its relevance within first amendment jurisprudence has been considerably diminished by subsequent rulings six years after dennis the court changed its interpretation of the smith act in yates v united states 41 the court ruled that the act was aimed at the advocacy of action not ideas 42 advocacy of abstract doctrine remains protected while speech explicitly inciting the forcible overthrow of the government is punishable under the smith act during the vietnam era the courts position on public criticism of the government changed drastically though the court upheld a law prohibiting the forgery mutilation or destruction of draft cards in united states v o brien 43 fearing that burning draft cards would interfere with the smooth and efficient functioning of the draft system 44 45 the next year the court handed down its decision in brandenburg v ohio 46 expressly overruling whitney v california 47 a case in which a woman was imprisoned for aiding the communist party 48 now the supreme court referred to the right to speak openly of violent action and revolution in broad terms our decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not allow a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or cause such action 49 brandenburg discarded the clear and present danger test introduced in schenck and further eroded dennis 50 in cohen v california 51 wearing a jacket reading fuck the draft in the corridors of the los angeles county courthouse was ruled not to be punishable political speech anonymous speech in talley v california 52 the court struck down a los angeles city ordinance that made it a crime to distribute anonymous pamphlets in mcintyre v ohio elections commission 53 the court struck down an ohio statute that made it a crime to distribute anonymous campaign literature however in meese v keene 54 the court upheld the foreign agents registration act of 1938 under which several canadian films were defined as political propaganda requiring their sponsors to be identified campaign finance main article campaign finance reform in buckley v valeo 55 the supreme court affirmed the constitutionality of some parts while declaring other parts unconstitutional of the federal election campaign act of 1971 and related laws these laws restricted the monetary contributions that may be made to political campaigns and expenditure by candidates the court concluded that limits on campaign contributions serve d the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion 56 however the court overturned the spending limits which it found imposed substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech 57 further rules on campaign finance were scrutinized by the court when it determined mcconnell v federal election commission 58 the case centered on the bipartisan campaign reform act of 2002 bcra a federal law that imposed new restrictions on campaign financing the supreme court upheld provisions which barred the raising of soft money by national parties and the use of soft money by private organizations to fund certain advertisements related to elections however the court struck down the choice of expenditure rule which required that parties could either make coordinated expenditures for all its candidates or permit candidates to spend independently but not both which they agreed placed an unconstitutional burden on the parties right to make unlimited independent expenditures 59 the supreme court also ruled that the provision preventing minors from making political contributions was unconstitutional relying on tinker v des moines independent community school district in federal election commission v wisconsin right to life inc 60 the supreme court sustained an as applied challenge to provisions of the 2002 law dealing with advertising shortly before a primary caucus or an election in davis v federal election commission 61 the supreme court declared the millionaire s amendment provisions of the bcra to be unconstitutional the court held that easing bcra restrictions for an opponent of a self financing candidate spending at least 350 000 of his own money violated the freedom of speech of the self financing candidate in citizens united v federal election commission 62 the court ruled that the bcra s federal restrictions on electoral advocacy by corporations or unions were unconstitutional for violating the free speech clause of the first amendment the court overruled austin v michigan chamber of commerce 63 which had upheld a state law that prohibited corporations from using treasury funds to support or oppose candidates in elections did not violate the first or fourteenth amendments the court also overruled the portion of mcconnell that upheld such restrictions under the bcra 64 in other words the ruling was considered to hold that political spending is a form of protected speech under the first amendment 65 one group advocating for a constitutional amendment to reverse citizens united urges we move to amend our constitution to firmly establish that money is not speech and that human beings not corporations are persons entitled to constitutional rights 66 flag desecration the divisive issue of flag desecration as a form of protest first came before the supreme court in street v new york 67 in response to hearing an erroneous report of the murder of james meredith sidney street burned a 48 star u s flag when questioned by the police he responded yes that is my flag i burned it if they let that happen to meredith we don t need an american flag 68 street was arrested and charged with a new york state law making it a crime publicly to mutilate deface defile or defy trample upon or cast contempt upon either by words or act any flag of the united states 69 street appealed his conviction to the supreme court arguing the law was overbroad both on its face and as applied that the language was vague and imprecise and did not clearly define the conduct which it forbids and that it unconstitutionally punished the destruction of an american flag an act which street contended constitute d expression protected by the fourteenth amendment 70 in a 5 4 decision the court relying on stromberg v california 71 found that because the provision of the new york law criminalizing words against the flag was unconstitutional and the trial did not sufficiently demonstrate that he was convicted solely under the provisions not yet deemed unconstitutional the conviction was unconstitutional the court however resist ed the pulls to decide the constitutional issues involved in this case on a broader basis and left the constitutionality of flag burning unaddressed 72 the ambiguity with regard to flag burning statutes was eliminated in texas v johnson 73 in that case gregory lee johnson participated in a demonstration during the 1984 republican national convention in dallas texas at one point during the demonstration johnson poured kerosene over an american flag and set it aflame shouting anti american phrases johnson was promptly arrested and charged with violating a texas law prohibiting the vandalizing of venerated objects he was convicted sentenced to one year in prison and fined 2 000 in 1989 his appeal reached the supreme court johnson argued that the texas statute imposed an unconstitutional content based restriction on symbolic speech the supreme court agreed and in a 5 4 vote reversed johnson s conviction justice william j brennan jr asserted that if there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment it is that government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable 74 many members of congress criticized the decision of the court and the house of representatives unanimously passed a resolution denouncing the court 75 congress passed a federal law barring flag burning but the supreme court struck it down as well in united states v eichman 76 many attempts have been made to amend the constitution to allow congress to prohibit the desecration of the flag since 1995 the flag desecration amendment has consistently mustered sufficient votes to pass in the house of representatives but not in the senate in 2000 the senate voted 63 37 in favor of the amendment which fell four votes short of the requisite two thirds majority in 2006 another attempt fell one vote short free speech zones main article free speech zone the free speech zone at the 2004 democratic national convention free speech zones are areas set aside in public places for political activists to exercise their right of freedom of speech as an exercise of what is commonly called tpm or time place manner regulation of speech free speech zones are set up by the secret service who scout locations near which the president is to pass or speak officials may target those displaying signs and escort them to the free speech zones before and during the event protesters who refuse to go to free speech zones could be arrested and charged with trespassing disorderly conduct and resisting arrest in 2003 a seldom used federal law was brought up that says that willfully and knowingly to enter or remain in any posted cordoned off or otherwise restricted area of a building or grounds where the president or other person protected by the secret service is or will be temporarily visiting is a crime 77 78 commercial speech commercial speech is speech done on behalf of a company or individual for the purpose of making a profit unlike political speech the supreme court does not afford commercial speech full protection under the first amendment to effectively distinguish commercial speech from other types of speech for purposes of litigation the supreme court uses a list of four indicia 79 the contents do no more than propose a commercial transaction the contents may be characterized as advertisements the contents reference a specific product the disseminator is economically motivated to distribute the speech alone each indicium does not compel the conclusion that an instance of speech is commercial however t he combination of all these characteristics provides strong support for the conclusion that the speech is properly characterized as commercial speech 80 in valentine v chrestensen 81 the court upheld a new york city ordinance forbidding the distribution in the streets of commercial and business advertising matter 82 writing for a unanimous court justice roberts explained this court has unequivocally held that streets are proper places for the exercise of the freedom of communicating information and disseminating opinion and that though the states and municipalities may appropriately regulate the privilege in the public interest they may not unduly burden or proscribe its employment in their public thoroughfares we are equally clear that the constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising 83 in virginia state pharmacy board v virginia citizens consumer council 84 the court overruled valentine and ruled that commercial speech was entitled to first amendment protection what is at issue is whether a state may completely suppress the dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity fearful of that information s effect upon its disseminators and its recipients w e conclude that the answer to this one is in the negative 85 in ohralik v ohio state bar association 86 the court ruled that commercial speech was not protected by the first amendment as much as other types of speech we have not discarded the common sense distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation and other varieties of speech to require a parity of constitutional protection for commercial and noncommercial speech alike could invite a dilution simply by a leveling process of the force of the first amendment s guarantee with respect to the latter kind of speech 87 in central hudson gas amp electric corp v public service commission 88 the court clarified what analysis was required before the government could justify regulating commercial speech is the expression protected by the first amendment lawful misleading fraud is the asserted government interest substantial does the regulation directly advance the governmental interest asserted is the regulation more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest six years later the supreme court applying the central hudson standards in posadas de puerto rico associates v tourism company of puerto rico 89 affirmed the supreme court of puerto rico s conclusion that puerto rico s games of chance act of 1948 including the regulations thereunder was not facially unconstitutional the lax interpretation of central hudson adopted by posadas was soon restricted under 44 liquormart inc v rhode island 90 when the court invalidated a rhode island law prohibiting the publication of liquor prices school speech in tinker v des moines independent community school district 91 the supreme court extended free speech rights to students in school the case involved several students who were punished for wearing black armbands to protest the vietnam war the supreme court ruled that the school could not restrict symbolic speech that did not cause undue interruptions of school activities justice abe fortas wrote s chools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism school officials do not possess absolute authority over their students students are possessed of fundamental rights which the state must respect just as they themselves must respect their obligations to the state however since 1969 the supreme court has placed a number of limitations on tinker interpretations in bethel school district v fraser 92 the court ruled that a student could be punished for his sexual innuendo laced speech before a school assembly and in hazelwood v kuhlmeier 93 the court found that school newspapers enjoyed fewer first amendment protections and are subject to school censorship more recently in morse v frederick 94 the court ruled that schools could consistent with the first amendment restrict student speech at school sponsored events even events away from school grounds if students promote illegal drug use obscenity main article united states obscenity law see also stanley v georgia right to pornography the federal government and the states have long been permitted to limit obscenity or pornography while the supreme court has generally refused to give obscenity any protection under the first amendment pornography is subject to little regulation however the exact definition of obscenity and pornography has changed over time in rosen v united states 1896 the supreme court adopted the same obscenity standard as had been articulated in a famous british case regina v hicklin 95 the hicklin test defined material as obscene if it tended to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall 96 the court ruled in roth v united states 97 that the hicklin test was inappropriate instead the roth test for obscenity was whether to the average person applying contemporary community standards the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest 98 justice potter stewart in jacobellis v ohio 99 famously stated that although he could not precisely define pornography i know it when i see it 100 the roth test was expanded when the court decided miller v california 101 under the miller test a work is obscene if a the average person applying contemporary community standards would find the work as a whole appeals to the prurient interest b the work depicts or describes in a patently offensive way sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law and c the work taken as a whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value 102 note that community standards not national standards are applied whether the material appeals to the prurient interest thus material may be deemed obscene in one locality but not in another national standards however are applied whether the material is of value child pornography is not subject to the miller test as the supreme court decided in new york v ferber 103 the court thought that the government s interest in protecting children from abuse was paramount 104 personal possession of obscene material in the home may not be prohibited by law in stanley v georgia 105 the court ruled that i f the first amendment means anything it means that a state has no business telling a man sitting in his own house what books he may read or what films he may watch 106 however it is constitutionally permissible for the government to prevent the mailing or sale of obscene items though they may be viewed only in private ashcroft v free speech coalition 107 further upheld these rights by invalidating the child pornography prevention act of 1996 holding that because the act p rohibit ed child pornography that does not depict an actual child it was overly broad and unconstitutional under the first amendment 108 and that first amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government seeks to control thought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end the right to think is the beginning of freedom and speech must be protected from the government because speech is the beginning of thought 109 in united states v williams 110 the court upheld the protect act of 2003 ruling that prohibiting offers to provide and requests to obtain child pornography did not violate the first amendment even if a person charged under the act did not possess child pornography 111 memoirs of convicted criminals in some states there are son of sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from publishing memoirs for profit these laws were a response to offers to david berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed the supreme court struck down a law of this type in new york as a violation of the first amendment in the case simon amp schuster v crime victims board 112 that statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal instead it provided that all profits from the book were to be put in escrow for a time the interest from the escrow account was used to fund the new york state crime victims board an organization that pays the medical and related bills of victims of crime similar laws in other states remain unchallenged defamation main article united states defamation law american tort liability for defamatory speech or publications traces its origins to english common law for the first two hundred years of american jurisprudence the basic substance of defamation law continued to resemble that existing in england at the time of the revolution an 1898 american legal textbook on defamation provides definitions of libel and slander nearly identical to those given by blackstone and coke an action of slander required 113 actionable words such as those imputing the injured party is guilty of some offense suffers from a contagious disease or psychological disorder is unfit for public office because of moral failings or an inability to discharge his or her duties or lacks integrity in profession trade or business that the charge must be false that the charge must be articulated to a third person verbally or in writing that the words are not subject to legal protection such as those uttered in congress and that the charge must be motivated by malice an action of libel required the same five general points as slander except that it specifically involved the publication of defamatory statements 114 for certain criminal charges of libel such as seditious libel the truth or falsity of the statements was immaterial as such laws were intended to maintain public support of the government and the truth of the statements merely eroded public support more thoroughly 115 instead libel placed specific emphasis on the result of the publication libelous publications tended to degrade and injure another person or bring him into contempt hatred or ridicule 114 concerns that defamation under common law might be incompatible with the new republican form of government caused early american courts to struggle between william blackstone s argument that the punishment of dangerous or offensive writings was necessary for the preservation of peace and good order of government and religion the only solid foundations of civil liberty and the argument that the need for a free press guaranteed by the constitution outweighed the fear of what might be written 115 consequently very few changes were made in the first two centuries after the ratification of the first amendment the supreme court s ruling in new york times co v sullivan 116 fundamentally changed american defamation law the case redefined the type of malice needed to sustain a libel case common law malice consisted ill will or wickedness now a public officials seeking to sustain a civil action against a tortfeasor needed to prove by clear and convincing evidence actual malice the case involved an advertisement published in the new york times indicating that officials in montgomery alabama had acted violently in suppressing the protests of african americans during the civil rights movement the montgomery police commissioner l b sullivan sued the times for libel claiming the advertisement damaged his reputation the supreme court unanimously overruled the 500 000 judgment against the times justice brennan suggested that public officials may sue for libel only if the publisher published the statements in question with actual malice knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not 117 while actual malice standard applies to public officials and public figures 118 in philadelphia newspapers v hepps 119 the court found that with regard to private individuals the first amendment does not necessarily force any change in at least some features of the common law landscape 120 in dun amp bradstreet inc v greenmoss builders inc 121 the court held that i n light of the reduced constitutional value of speech involving no matters of public concern the state interest adequately supports awards of presumed and punitive damages even absent a showing of actual malice 122 despite varying from state to state private individuals generally need prove only the negligence of the defendant in greenbelt cooperative publishing association inc v bresler 123 the supreme court ruled that a greenbelt news review article which quoted a visitor to a city council meeting who characterized bresler s aggressive stance in negotiating with the city as blackmail was not libelous since nobody could believe anyone was claiming that bresler had committed the crime of blackmail and that the statement was essentially hyperbole i e clearly an opinion the supreme court ruled in gertz v robert welch inc 124 opinions could not be considered defamatory it is therefore permissible to suggest for instance that someone is a bad lawyer but not permissible to declare falsely that the lawyer is ignorant of the law the former constitutes a statement of values but the latter is a statement alleging a fact more recently in milkovich v lorain journal co 125 the supreme court backed off from the protection from opinion announced in gertz the court in milkovich specifically held that there is no wholesale exception to defamation law for statements labeled opinion but instead that a statement must be provably false falsifiable before it can be the subject of a libel suit hustler magazine v falwell 126 extended the actual malice standard to intentional infliction of emotional distress in a ruling which protected a parody private action the noerr pennington doctrine is a rule of law that often prohibits the application of antitrust law to statements made by competitors before public bodies a monopolist may freely go before the city council and encourage the denial of its competitor s building permit without being subject to sherman act liability increasingly this doctrine has been applied to litigation outside the antitrust context including state tort suits for intentional interference with business relations and slapp suits state constitutions provide free speech protections similar to those of the u s constitution in a few states such as california a state constitution has been interpreted as providing more comprehensive protections than the first amendment the supreme court has permitted states to extend such enhanced protections most notably in pruneyard shopping center v robins 127 in that case the court unanimously ruled that while the first amendment may allow private property owners to prohibit trespass by political speakers and petition gatherers california was permitted to restrict property owners whose property is equivalent to a traditional public forum often shopping malls and grocery stores from enforcing their private property rights to exclude such individuals writing for the majority justice rehnquist rejected the appellants argument for the common law s protection of property against trespass writing that such an interpretation would represent a return to the era of lochner v new york 198 u s 45 1905 when common law rights were also found immune from revision it would freeze the common law as it has been constructed by courts perhaps at its 19th century state of development 128 however the court did maintain that shopping centers could impose reasonable restrictions on expressive activity 129 subsequently new jersey colorado massachusetts and puerto rico courts have adopted the doctrine 130 131 california s courts have repeatedly reaffirmed it 132 the supreme court has never interpreted the first amendment as having the power to alter purely private property rights or provide any other protection against purely private action when considering private authority figures such as parents or an employer the first amendment provides no protection a private authority figure may reserve the right to censor their subordinate s speech or discriminate on the basis of speech without any legal consequences all may dismiss their employees at will for good cause for no cause or even for a cause morally wrong without thereby being guilty of a legal wrong 133 with specific regard to employee free speech a few court cases illuminate the limits of the first amendment vis a vis private employment in korb v raytheon 134 raytheon terminated lawrence korb after receiving complaints of his public involvement in an anti nuclear proliferation nonprofit known as the committee for national security cns and his advocacy of reduced defense spending on february 26 1986 the washington post ran an article describing korb s speech at a press conference held the day prior as critical of increased defense spending following the publication of the article several military officials expressed their disapproval of korb s comments 135 despite writing a letter of retraction which ran in the washington post raytheon terminated korb s position after it continued to receive navy air force and armed services committee objections 136 in adjudicating korb s claim of wrongful discharge the massachusetts supreme judicial court found no public policy prohibiting an employer from discharging an ineffective at will employee his claim under the state civil rights act was dismissed as well in affirming the lower courts decision to dismiss justice abrams wrote although korb has a secured right to speak out on matters of public concern and he has a right to express views with which raytheon disagrees he has no right to do so at raytheon s expense 137 in the similar case drake v cheyenne newspapers inc 138 kerry drake and kelly flores editorial employees at cheyenne newspapers inc were fired for refusing to wear a button urging a no vote on the unionization of the editorial division 139 drake and flores filed an action claiming the management engaged in a retaliatory discharge in violation of public policy breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breach of the employment contract 139 drake and flores argued that the right to speech found in the wyoming constitution at art 1 20 represents an important public policy which the newspaper violated when it terminated their employment because they exercised free speech 140 in examining the court precedent the wyoming supreme court concluded that t erminating an at will employee for exercising his right to free speech by refusing to follow a legal directive of an employer on the employer s premises during working hours does not violate public policy 140 as for drake and flores claim for breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing the court found no explicit promise by the newspaper that they would terminate only for cause 141 korb and drake do not however demonstrate an absence of free speech protections at private employers but merely the limits of such protections in both korb and drake public policy was mentioned as a possible cause of action since petermann v international brotherhood of teamsters 142 courts have recognized public policy exceptions to at will terminations in that case the california court of appeals held it would be obnoxious to the interests of the state and contrary to public policy and sound morality to allow an employer to discharge an employee whether the employment be for a designated or unspecified duration on the ground that the employee declined to commit perjury an act specifically enjoined by statute 143 in some jurisdictions courts have moved to expand some speech protections to political activity under the public policy doctrine in novosel v nationwide 144 the court found some public policy protection of private sector employee free speech writing t he protection of an employee s freedom of political expression would appear to involve no less compelling a societal interest than the fulfillment of jury service or the filing of a workers compensation claim 145 the court found pennsylvania law permits a cause of action for wrongful discharge where the employment termination abridges a significant and recognized public policy 146 subsequently however the pennsylvania courts rejected the third circuit s reasoning that you can t claim wrongful discharge under a provision of the constitution unless you can show state action which is impossible where the employer is a private enterprise 147 freedom of the press main article freedom of the press in the united states in lovell v city of griffin 148 chief justice hughes defined the press as every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion 149 freedom of the press like freedom of speech is subject to restrictions on bases such as defamation law in branzburg v hayes 150 the court ruled that the first amendment did not give a journalist the right to refuse a subpoena from a grand jury the issue decided in the case was whether a journalist could refuse to appear and testify before state and federal grand juries basing the refusal on the belief that such appearance and testimony abridges the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the first amendment 151 the 5 4 decision was that such a protection was not provided by the first amendment taxation of the press state governments retain the right to tax newspapers just as they may tax other commercial products generally however taxes that focus exclusively on newspapers have been found unconstitutional in grosjean v american press co 152 the court invalidated a state tax on newspaper advertising revenues similarly some taxes that give preferential treatment to the press have been struck down in arkansas writers project v ragland 153 for instance the court invalidated an arkansas law exempting religious professional trade and sports journals from taxation since the law amounted to the regulation of newspaper content in leathers v medlock 154 the supreme court found that states may treat different types of the media differently such as by taxing cable television but not newspapers the court found that differential taxation of speakers even members of the press does not implicate the first amendment unless the tax is directed at or presents the danger of suppressing particular ideas 155 content regulation the courts have rarely treated content based regulation of journalism with any sympathy in miami herald publishing co v tornillo 156 the court unanimously struck down a state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses the state claimed that the law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility the supreme court found that freedom but not responsibility is mandated by the first amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish content based regulation of television and radio however have been sustained by the supreme court in various cases since there is a limited number of frequencies for non cable television and radio stations the government licenses them to various companies however the supreme court has ruled that the problem of scarcity does not allow the raising of a first amendment issue the government may restrain broadcasters but only on a content neutral basis in federal communications commission v pacifica foundation 157 the supreme court upheld the federal communications commission s authority to restrict the use of indecent material in broadcasting petition and assembly main articles right to petition in the united states and freedom of assembly the petition clause states that congress shall make no law abridging the right of the people to petition the government for a redress of grievances 158 the right of petition took its rise from the modest provision made for it in chapter 61 of magna carta 159 which stated that the barons shall choose any twenty five barons of the kingdom they wish who must with all their might observe hold and cause to be observed the peace and liberties which we have granted and confirmed to thern by this present charter of ours so that if we or our justiciar or our bailiffs or any one of our servants offend in any way against anyone or transgress any of the articles of the peace or the security and the offence be notified to four of the aforesaid twenty five barons those four barons shall come to us or to our justiciar if we are out ef the kingdom and laying the transgression before us shall petition us to have that transgression corrected without delay the right to petition was an echo of the english bill of rights 1689 which stated i t is the right of the subjects to petition the king and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal 160 the petition clause prohibits congress from restricting the people s right to appeal to government in favor of or against policies that affect them or about which they feel strongly including the right to gather signatures in support of a cause and to lobby legislative bodies for or against legislation 161 a more simple definition of the right to petition is the right to present requests to the government without punishment or reprisal this right is guaranteed in the first amendment to the u s constitution 161 looking at the specific definition of the word petition as it relates to the freedom of petition and the first amendment the word can be used to describe any nonviolent legal means of encouraging or disapproving government action whether directed to the judicial executive or legislative branch lobbying letter writing e mail campaigns testifying before tribunals filing lawsuits supporting referenda collecting signatures for ballot initiatives peaceful protests and picketing all public articulation of issues complaints and interests designed to spur government action qualifies under the petition clause 161 the right to petition grants people not only the freedom to stand up and speak out against injustices they feel are occurring but also grants the power to help change those injustices 161 it is important to note that in response to a petition from a citizen or citizens the government is not required to actually respond or address the issue under the petition clause the government is only required to provide a way for citizens to petition and a method in which they will receive the petition 161 the right to petition the government extends to petitions of all three branches of government the congress the executive and the judiciary 162 according to the supreme court redress of grievances is to be construed broadly it includes not solely appeals by the public to the government for the redressing of a grievance in the traditional sense but also petitions on behalf of private interests seeking personal gain 163 more specifically the right to petition is no longer confined to demands for a redress of grievances in any accurate meaning of these words but comprehends demands for an exercise by the government of its powers in furtherance of the interest and prosperity of the petitioners and of their views on politically contentious matters 159 164 the right extends to the approach of citizens or groups of them to administrative agencies which are both creatures of the legislature and arms of the executive and to courts the third branch of government certainly the right to petition extends to all departments of the government the right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition 165 nonetheless in the past congress has directly limited the right to petition during the 1790s congress passed the alien and sedition acts punishing opponents of the federalist party the supreme court never ruled on the matter in 1835 the house of representatives adopted the gag rule barring abolitionist petitions calling for the end of slavery the supreme court did not hear a case related to the rule which was abolished in 1844 during world war i individuals petitioning for the repeal of sedition and espionage laws were punished again the supreme court did not rule on the matter in borough of duryea v guarnieri 166 the supreme court stated regarding the free speech clause and the petition clause it is not necessary to say that the two clauses are identical in their mandate or their purpose and effect to acknowledge that the rights of speech and petition share substantial common ground this court has said that the right to speak and the right to petition are cognate rights thomas v collins 323 u s 516 530 1945 see also wayte v united states 470 u s 598 610 n 11 1985 it was not by accident or coincidence that the rights to freedom in speech and press were coupled in a single guaranty with the rights of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for redress of grievances thomas 323 u s at 530 both speech and petition are integral to the democratic process although not necessarily in the same way the right to petition allows citizens to express their ideas hopes and concerns to their government and their elected representatives whereas the right to speak fosters the public exchange of ideas that is integral to deliberative democracy as well as to the whole realm of ideas and human affairs beyond the political sphere both speech and petition advance personal expression although the right to petition is generally concerned with expression directed to the government seeking redress of a grievance courts should not presume there is always an essential equivalence in the two clauses or that speech clause precedents necessarily and in every case resolve petition clause claims see ibid rights of speech and petition are not identical interpretation of the petition clause must be guided by the objectives and aspirations that underlie the right a petition conveys the special concerns of its author to the government and in its usual form requests action by the government to address those concerns see sure tan inc supra at 896 897 this court s opinion in mcdonald v smith 472 u s 479 1985 has sometimes been interpreted to mean that the right to petition can extend no further than the right to speak but mcdonald held only that speech contained within a petition is subject to the same standards for defamation and libel as speech outside a petition in those circumstances the court found no sound basis for granting greater constitutional protection to statements made in a petition than other first amendment expressions id at 485 there may arise cases where the special concerns of the petition clause would provide a sound basis for a distinct analysis and if that is so the rules and principles that define the two rights might differ in emphasis and formulation 158 the right of assembly was originally distinguished from the right to petition in united states v cruikshank 167 the supreme court held that the right of the people peaceably to assemble for the purpose of petitioning congress for a redress of grievances or for anything else connected with the powers or duties of the national government is an attribute of national citizenship and as such under protection of and guaranteed by the united states the very idea of a government republican in form implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances 168 justice waite s opinion for the court carefully distinguished the right to peaceably assemble as a secondary right while the right to petition was labeled to be a primary right later cases however paid less attention to these distinctions 159 freedom of association further information freedom of association although it is not explicitly protected in the first amendment the supreme court ruled in naacp v alabama 169 freedom of association to be a fundamental right protected by it in roberts v united states jaycees 170 the supreme court held that associations may not exclude people for reasons unrelated to the group s expression however in hurley v irish american gay lesbian and bisexual group of boston 515 u s 557 1995 the court ruled that a group may exclude people from membership if their presence would affect the group s ability to advocate a particular point of view likewise in boy scouts of america v dale 171 the supreme court ruled that a new jersey law which forced the boy scouts of america to admit an openly gay member to be an unconstitutional abridgment of the boy scouts right to free association international significance part of the united states bill of rights is rooted in the english bill of rights and other aspects of english law the english bill of rights however does not include many of the protections found in the first amendment for example while the first amendment guarantees freedom of speech to the general populace the english bill of rights protected only freedome of speech and debates or proceedings in parlyament 172 the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen a french revolutionary document passed just weeks before congress proposed the bill of rights contains certain guarantees that are similar to those in the first amendment for instance it suggests that every citizen may accordingly speak write and print with freedom 173 article iii sections 4 and 5 of the constitution of the philippines written in 1987 contain identical wording to the first amendment regarding speech and religion respectively 174 these phrases can also be found in the 1973 175 and 1935 176 philippine constitutions all three constitutions contain in the section on principles the sentence the separation of church and state shall be inviolable echoing jefferson s famous phrase while the first amendment does not explicitly set restrictions on freedom of speech other declarations of rights sometimes do so the european convention on human rights for example permits restrictions in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or the rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary 177 similarly the constitution of india allows reasonable restrictions upon free speech to serve public order security of state decency or morality 178 the first amendment was one of the first guarantees of religious freedom neither the english bill of rights nor the french declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen contains a similar guarantee see also bill of rights 1689 censorship in the united states freedom
