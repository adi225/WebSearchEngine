a theorem with two distinct interpretations in the bayesian interpretation it expresses how a subjective degree of belief should rationally change to account for evidence in the frequentist interpretation it relates inverse representations of the probabilities concerning two events in the bayesian interpretation bayes theorem is fundamental to bayesian statistics and has applications in fields including science engineering economics particularly microeconomics game theory medicine and law the application of bayes theorem to update beliefs is called bayesian inference bayes theorem is named after thomas bayes b e z 1701 1761 who first suggested using the theorem to update beliefs his work was significantly edited and updated by richard price before it was posthumously read at the royal society the ideas gained limited exposure until they were independently rediscovered and further developed by laplace who first published the modern formulation in his 1812 th orie analytique des probabilit s until the second half of the 20th century the bayesian interpretation was largely rejected by the mathematics community as unscientific citation needed however it is now widely accepted this may have been due to the development of computing which enabled the successful application of bayesianism to many complex problems 1 contents 1 introductory example 2 statement and

someone told you they had a nice conversation with someone on the train not knowing anything else about this conversation the probability that they were speaking to a woman is 50 now suppose they also told you that this person had long hair it is now more likely they were speaking to a woman since most long haired people are women bayes theorem can be used to calculate the probability that the person is a woman to see how this is done let represent the event that the conversation was held with a woman and denote the event that the conversation was held with a long haired person it can be assumed that women constitute half the population for this example so not knowing anything else the probability that occurs is suppose it is also known that 75 of women have long hair which we denote as read the probability of event given event is 0 75 likewise suppose it is known that 30 of men have long hair or where is the complementary event of i e the event that the conversation was held with a man assuming that every human is either a man or a woman our goal is to calculate the probability that the conversation was held with a woman given the fact that the person had long hair or in our notation using the formula for bayes theorem we have where we have used the law of total probability the numeric answer can be obtained by substituting the above values into this formula this yields i e the probability that the conversation was held with a woman given that the person had long hair is about 71 edit statement and interpretation mathematically bayes theorem gives the relationship between the probabilities of and and and the conditional probabilities of given and given and in its most common form it is the meaning of this statement depends on the interpretation of probability ascribed to the terms edit bayesian interpretation main article bayesian probability in the bayesian or epistemological interpretation probability measures a degree of belief bayes theorem then links the degree of belief in a proposition before and after accounting for evidence for example suppose somebody proposes that a biased coin is twice as likely to land heads than tails degree of belief in this might initially be 50 the coin is then flipped a number of times to collect evidence belief may rise to 70 if the evidence supports the proposition for proposition and evidence the prior is the initial degree of belief in the posterior is the degree of belief having accounted for represents the support provides for for more on the application of bayes theorem under the bayesian interpretation of probability see bayesian inference edit frequentist interpretation illustration of frequentist interpretation with tree diagrams bayes theorem connects conditional probabilities to their inverses in the frequentist interpretation probability measures a proportion of outcomes for example suppose an experiment is performed many times is the proportion of outcomes with property and that with property is the proportion of outcomes with property out of outcomes with property and the proportion of those with out of those with the role of bayes theorem is best visualized with tree diagrams as shown to the right the two diagrams partition the same outcomes by and in opposite orders to obtain the inverse probabilities bayes theorem serves as the link between these different partitionings edit forms edit events edit simple form for events and provided that in a bayesian inference step the probability of evidence is constant for all models the posterior may then be expressed as proportional to the numerator edit extended form often for some partition of the event space the event space is given or conceptualized in terms of and it is then useful to eliminate using the law of total probability in the special case of a binary partition edit random variables diagram illustrating the meaning of bayes theorem as applied to an event space generated by continuous random variables and note that there exists an instance of bayes theorem for each point in the domain in practise these instances might be parametrised by writing the specified probability densities as a function of and consider a sample space generated by two random variables and in principle bayes theorem applies to the events and however terms become 0 at points where either variable has finite probability density to remain useful bayes theorem may be formulated in terms of the relevant densities see derivation edit simple form if is continuous and is discrete if is discrete and is continuous if both and are continuous edit extended form diagram illustrating how an event space generated by continuous random variables x and y is often conceptualized a continuous event space is often conceptualized in terms of the numerator terms it is then useful to eliminate the denominator using the law of total probability for this becomes an integral edit bayes rule main article bayes rule under the bayesian interpretation of probability bayes rule may be thought of as bayes theorem in odds form where so the rule says that the posterior odds are the prior odds times the bayes factor edit derivation edit for events bayes theorem may be derived from the definition of conditional probability edit for random variables for two continuous random variables and bayes theorem may be analogously derived from the definition of conditional density edit examples edit frequentist example tree diagram illustrating frequentist example r c p and p bar are the events representing rare common pattern and no pattern percentages in parentheses are calculated note that three independent values are given so it is possible to calculate the inverse tree see figure above an entomologist spots what might be a rare subspecies of beetle due to the pattern on its back in the rare subspecies 98 have the pattern in the common subspecies 5 have the pattern the rare subspecies accounts for only 0 1 of the population how likely is the beetle to be rare from the extended form of bayes theorem edit drug testing tree diagram illustrating drug testing example u u bar and are the events representing user non user positive result and negative result percentages in parentheses are calculated suppose a drug test is 99 sensitive and 99 specific that is the test will produce 99 true positive results for drug users and 99 true negative results for non drug users suppose that 0 5 of people are users of the drug if a randomly selected individual tests positive what is the probability he or she is a user despite the apparent accuracy of the test if an individual tests positive it is more likely that they do not use the drug than that they do this surprising result arises because the number of non users is very large compared to the number of users such that the number of false positives 0 995 outweighs the number of true positives 0 495 to use concrete numbers if 1000 individuals are tested there are expected to be 995 non users and 5 users from the 995 non users false positives are expected from the 5 users true positives are expected out of 15 positive results only 5 about 33 are genuine edit history bayes theorem was named after the reverend thomas bayes 1701 61 who studied how to compute a distribution for the probability parameter of a binomial distribution in modern terminology his friend richard price edited and presented this work in 1763 after bayes death as an essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances 2 the french mathematician pierre simon laplace reproduced and extended bayes results in 1774 apparently quite unaware of bayes work 3 stephen stigler suggested in 1983 that bayes theorem was discovered by nicholas saunderson some time before bayes 4 however this interpretation has been disputed 5 stephen fienberg describes the evolution from inverse probability at the time of bayes and laplace a term still used by harold jeffreys in 1939 to bayesian in the 1950s 6 and notes that ronald a fisher was the first to use the term bayesian albeit in a derogatory sense edit notes mcgrayne sharon bertsch
