tape to random access processing since it was now technically possible to store a single fact in a single place and access that using random access disk those suggesting that data management was more important than process management used arguments such as a customer s home address is stored in 75 or some other large number places in our computer systems during this period random access processing was not competitively fast so those suggesting process management was more important than data management used batch processing time as their primary argument as applications moved more and more into real time interactive applications it became obvious to most practitioners that both management processes were important if the data was not well defined the data would be mis used in applications if the process wasn t well defined it was impossible to meet user needs edit corporate data quality management corporate data quality management cdqm is according to the european foundation for quality

board this publication is available from april 5 2009 edit usage in modern management usage one can easily discern a trend away from the term data in composite expressions to the term information or even knowledge when talking in non technical context thus there exists not only data management but also information management and knowledge management this is a misleading trend as it obscures that traditional data is managed or somehow processed on second looks the distinction between data and derived values can be seen in the information ladder while data can exist as such information and knowledge are always in the eye or rather the brain of the beholder and can only be measured in relative units edit see also information architecture enterprise architecture information design
