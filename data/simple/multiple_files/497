brusilov offensive of the russian army almost completely destroyed the military of austria hungary however the already existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war high casualties and rumors of corruption and treason all this formed the climate for the russian revolution of 1917 carried out in two major acts the february revolution forced nicholas ii to abdicate he and his family were imprisoned and later executed during the russian civil war the monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the provisional government an alternative socialist establishment existed alongside the petrograd soviet wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants called soviets the rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country instead of resolving it eventually the october revolution led by bolshevik leader vladimir lenin overthrew the provisional government and gave

its entire 69 year history following lenin s death in 1924 a troika had been designated to govern the soviet union however joseph stalin an elected general secretary of the communist party managed to put down all opposition groups within the party and consolidate much power in his hands leon trotsky the main proponent of the world revolution was exiled from the soviet union in 1929 and stalin s idea of socialism in one country became the primary line the continued internal struggle in the bolshevik party culminated in the great purge a period of mass repressions in 1937 38 in which hundreds of thousands of people were executed including original party members and military leaders convicted in coup d tat plots 67 defenders of leningrad under stalin s leadership the government launched a planned economy industrialisation of the largely rural country and collectivization of its agriculture during this period of rapid economical and social changes millions of people were sent to penal labor camps 68 including many political convicts who opposed stalin s rule and millions were deported and exiled to remote areas of the soviet union 68 the transitional disorganisation of the country s agriculture combined with the harsh state policies and a drought led to the soviet famine of 1932 1933 69 however though with a heavy price the soviet union was transformed from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse in a short span of time the appeasement policy of great britain and france towards adolf hitler s annexation of austria and czechoslovakia enlarged the might

opposition persistent anti soviet guerilla warfare enhanced by the u s and a lack of support from soviet citizens from 1985 onwards the last soviet leader mikhail gorbachev who sought to enact liberal reforms in the soviet system introduced the policies of glasnost openness and perestroika restructuring in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation in the country and democratise the

renewed federation in august 1991 a coup d tat attempt by members of gorbachev s government directed against gorbachev and aimed at preserving the soviet union instead led to the end of the communist
