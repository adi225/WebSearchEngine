commercial book identifier based upon the 9 digit standard book numbering sbn code created by gordon foster emeritus professor of statistics at trinity college dublin 3 for the booksellers and stationers w h smith and others in 1965 4 the 10 digit isbn format was developed by the international organization for standardization iso and was published in 1970 as international standard iso 2108 4 however the 9 digit sbn code was used in the united kingdom until 1974 an sbn may be converted to an isbn by prepending the digit 0 iso has appointed the international isbn agency as the registration authority for isbn worldwide and the isbn standard is developed under the control of iso technical committee 46 subcommittee 9 tc 46 sc 9 the iso on line facility only refers back to 1978 5 since 1 january 2007 isbns have contained 13 digits a format that is compatible with bookland ean 13s 6 occasionally a book may appear without a printed isbn if it is printed privately or the author

international standard book numbers issuance is country specific in that isbns are issued by the isbn registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory the ranges of isbns assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned e g the number of books and the number type and size of publishers that are active some isbn registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services in other cases the isbn registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers who are not government funded in canada the stated purpose of issuing international standard book numbers for no cost was to encourage canadian culture in the united kingdom united states and some other countries where the service is provided by non government funded organisations the issuing of international standard book numbers is a chargeable service australia in australia isbns are issued by the commercial library services agency thorpe bowker and prices range from 40 for a single isbn plus a 55 registration fee for new publishers through to 2 750 for a block of 1 000 isbns 15 canada in canada library and archives canada a government agency is the responsible entity and there is no cost pakistan national library of

lots of ten or more united states in the united states the privately held company r r bowker is the responsible entity and there is a charge which varies depending upon the number of isbns purchased with prices ranging from 125 00 for a single number 17 publishers and authors in other countries need to obtain isbns from their respective national isbn registration agency a directory of isbn agencies is available on the international isbn agency website edit registration group identifier the registration group identifier is a 1 to 5 digit number the single digit group identifiers are 0 or 1 for english speaking countries 2 for french speaking countries 3 for german speaking countries 4 for japan 5 for russian speaking countries 7 for people s republic of china an example 5 digit group identifier is 99936 for bhutan the allocated group ids are 0 5 600 621 7 80 94 950 989 9927 9989 and 99901 99972 18 books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers 19 the original standard book number sbn had no registration group identifier but affixing a zero 0 as prefix to a 9 digit sbn creates a valid 10 digit isbn edit registrant element the national isbn agency assigns the registrant element cf category isbn agencies and an accompanying series of isbns within that registrant element to the publisher the publisher then allocates one of the isbns to each of his books generally in most countries a book publisher is not required by law to assign an isbn however most book stores only handle isbn bearing merchandise a listing of more than 900 000 assigned publisher codes is published and can be ordered in book form 1399 us 1959 the web site of the isbn agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes 20 partial lists have been compiled from library catalogs for the english language groups identifier 0 and identifier 1 publishers receive blocks of isbns with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them a small publisher may receive isbns of one or more digits for the registration group identifier several digits for the registrant and a single digit for the publication element once that block of isbns is used the publisher may receive another block of isbns with a different registrant element consequently a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements there also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country this might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers by using variable block lengths registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of isbns that they make to publishers for example a large publisher may be given a block of isbns where the digits allocated for the registrant element are few and there are many digits allocated for the publication element likewise countries publishing a large output of titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements 21 here are some sample isbn 10 codes illustrating block length variations isbn country or area publisher 99921 58 10 7 qatar nccah doha

consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the message edit isbn 10 check digit calculation the 2001 edition of the official manual of the international isbn agency says that the isbn 10 check digit 23 160 which is the last digit of the ten digit isbn 160 must range from 0 to 10 the symbol x is used instead of 10 and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by the integer weight descending from 10 to 1 is a multiple of the number 11 modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11 each of the first nine digits of the ten digit isbn 160 excluding the check digit itself 160 is multiplied by a number in a sequence from 10 to 2 and the remainder of the sum with respect to 11 is computed the resulting remainder plus the check digit must equal 11 therefore the check digit is 11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products for example the check digit for an isbn 10 of 0 306 40615 is calculated as follows thus the check digit is 2 and the complete sequence is isbn 0 306 40615 2 formally the check digit calculation is the value required to satisfy this condition might be 10 if so an x should be used the two most common errors in handling an isbn e g typing or writing it are an altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits the isbn check digit method ensures that these two errors will always be detected however if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected the book will be issued with an invalid isbn 24 edit alternative calculation php function is isbn 10 valid isbn10 if

13 check digit calculation the 2005 edition of the international isbn agency s official manual 25 describes how the 13 digit isbn check digit is calculated the calculation of an isbn 13 check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen digit isbn thus excluding the check digit itself each digit from left to right is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3 then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9 subtracted from 10 that leaves a result from 1 to 10 a zero 0 replaces a ten 10 so in all cases a single check digit results for example the isbn 13 check digit of 978 0 306 40615 is calculated as follows s 9 1 7 3 8 1 0 3 3 1 0 3 6 1 4 3 0 1 6 3 1 1 5 3 9 21 8 0 3 0 6 12 0 18 1 15 93 93 10 9 remainder 3 10 3 7 thus the check digit is 7 and the complete sequence is isbn 978 0 306 40615 7 formally the isbn 13 check digit calculation is this check system 160 similar to the upc check digit formula 160 does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition specifically if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5 the check digit will not catch their transposition for instance the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1 the correct order contributes 3 6 1 1 19 to the sum while if the digits are transposed 1 followed by a 6 the contribution of those two digits will be 3 1 1 6 9 however 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10 and so produce the same final result both isbns will have a check digit of 7 the isbn 10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot but requires more than the digits 0 9 to express the check digit additionally if the sum of the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits 1st 3rd 5th 7th 9th 11th and 13th the total will always be divisible by 10 i e end in 0 java public static boolean isisbn13valid string isbn int check 0 for int i 0 i lt 12 i 2 check integer valueof isbn substring i i 1 for int i 1 i lt 12 i 2 check

publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the isbn check digit publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its isbn before publishing it that failure causes book identification problems for libraries booksellers and readers 26 most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid isbn issued by the publisher the library of congress catalogue contains books published with invalid isbns which it usually tags with the phrase cancelled isbn 27 however book ordering systems such as amazon com will not search for a book if an invalid isbn is entered to its search engine citation needed edit ean format used in barcodes and upgrading currently the barcodes on a book s back cover or inside a mass market paperback book s front cover are ean 13 they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits for the currency and the recommended retail price 28 for 10 digit isbns the number 978 the bookland country code is prefixed to the isbn in the barcode data and the check digit is recalculated according to the ean13 formula modulo 10 1x and 3x weighting on alternate digits partly because of an expected shortage in certain isbn categories the international organization for standardization iso decided to migrate to a thirteen digit isbn isbn 13 the process began january 1 2005 and was planned to conclude january 1 2007 29 as of 2011 all the 13 digit isbns begin with 978 as the 978 isbn supply is exhausted the 979 prefix will be introduced part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the musicland code for musical scores with an ismn 10 digit ismn codes differed visually as they began with an m letter the bar code represents the m as a zero 0 and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3 all ismns are now 13 digits commencing 979 0 979 1 to 979 9 will be used by isbn publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 isbns likewise there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same moreover the ten digit isbn check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen digit isbn check digit because the ean ucc 13 is part of the global trade item number gtin system that includes the ean ucc 14 the upc 12 and the ean 8 it is expected that isbn generating software should accommodate fourteen digit isbns 30 barcode format compatibility is maintained because aside from the group breaks the isbn 13 barcode format is identical to the ean barcode format of existing isbn 10s so migration to an ean based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non book products that is compatible with existing isbn based data with only minimal changes to information technology systems hence many booksellers e g barnes amp noble migrated to ean barcodes as early as march 2005 although many american and canadian booksellers were able to read ean 13 barcodes before 2005 most general retailers could not read them the upgrading of the upc barcode system to full ean 13 in 2005 eased migration to the isbn 13 in north america edit see also asin amazon standard identification number coden serial publication identifier
