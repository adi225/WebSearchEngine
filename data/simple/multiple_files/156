for ibm mainframe term for a file see dataset ibm mainframe for the telecommunications interface device see modem a dataset or data set is a collection of data usually presented in tabular form each column represents a particular variable each row corresponds to a given member of the dataset in question it lists values for each of the variables such as height and weight of an object each value is known as a datum the dataset may comprise data for one or more members corresponding to the number of rows nontabular datasets can take the form of marked up strings of characters such as an xml file contents 1 history 2 properties 3 classic datasets 4 see also 5 notes 6 external links edit history historically the term originated in the mainframe field where it had a well defined meaning very close to contemporary computer file citation needed edit properties several characteristics define a dataset s structure and properties these include the number and types of the attributes or variables and various statistical measures applicable to them such as standard deviation and kurtosis 1 in the simplest case there is only one variable and the dataset consists of a single column of values often represented as a list in spite of the name such a univariate dataset is not a set in the usual mathematical sense since a given value may occur multiple times usually the order does not matter and then the collection of values may be considered a multiset rather than an ordered list original research the values may be numbers such as real numbers or integers for example representing a person s height in centimeters but may also be nominal data i e not consisting of numerical values for example representing a person s ethnicity more generally values may be of any of the kinds described as a level of measurement for each variable the values are normally all of the same kind however there may also be missing values which must be indicated in some way in statistics datasets usually come from actual observations obtained by sampling a statistical population and each row corresponds to the observations on one element of that population datasets may further be generated by algorithms for the purpose of testing certain kinds of software some modern statistical analysis software such as pspp still present their data in the classical dataset fashion edit classic datasets several classic datasets have been used extensively in the statistical literature iris flower data set multivariate dataset introduced by ronald fisher 1936 2 categorical data analysis datasets used in the book an introduction to categorical data analysis by agresti are provided on line by statlib robust statistics datasets used in robust regression and outlier detection rousseeuw and leroy 1986 provided on line at the university of cologne time series data used in chatfield s book the analysis of time series are provided on line by statlib extreme values data used in the book an introduction to the statistical modeling of extreme values are provided on line by stuart coles the book s author dead link bayesian data analysis data used in the book are provided on line by andrew gelman one of the book s authors the bupa liver data used in several papers in the machine learning data mining literature anscombe s quartet small dataset illustrating the importance of graphing the data to avoid statistical fallacies edit see also interoperability 3 edit notes jan m ytkow jan rauch 1999 principles of data mining and knowledge discovery isbn 160 978 3 540 66490 1 http books google co uk books id utzerzfmabgc amp pg pa100 fisher r a 1936 the use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems annals of eugenics 7 179 188 doi 10 1111 j 1469 1809 1936 tb02137 x http digital library adelaide edu au coll special fisher 138 pdf king edit external links the datahub a community managed home for open datasets research pipeline a wiki website with links to datasets on many different topics statlib datasets archive statlib jasa data archive data gov uk government public data gcmd the global change master directory contains more than 20 000 descriptions of earth science datasets and services covering all aspects of earth and environmental sciences
