an operational data store or ods is a database designed to integrate data from multiple sources for additional operations on the data the data is then passed back to operational systems for further operations and to the data warehouse for reporting because the data originates from multiple sources the integration often involves cleaning resolving redundancy and checking against business rules for integrity an ods is usually designed to contain low level or atomic indivisible data such as transactions and prices with limited history that is captured real time or near real time as opposed to the much greater volumes of data stored in the data warehouse generally on a less frequent basis contents 1 general use 2 publications 3 external links 4 see also edit general use the general purpose of an ods is to integrate data from disparate source systems in a single structure using data integration technologies like data virtualization data federation or extract transform and load this will allow operational access to the data for operational reporting master data or reference data management an ods is not a replacement or substitute for an enterprise data warehouse but in turn could become a source some examples of ods architecture patterns can be found in the article architecture patterns edit publications inmon william 1999 building the operational data store second edition john wiley amp sons isbn 160 0 471 32888 x edit external links ods architecture patterns ea reference architecture bill inmon information management article on ods bill inmon information management article on the five classes of ods claudia imhoff information management article on ods v t e data warehouse 160 creating the data warehouse concepts database dimension dimensional modeling fact olap star schema aggregate variants anchor modeling column oriented dbms data vault modeling holap molap rolap operational data store elements data dictionary metadata data mart sixth normal form surrogate key fact fact table early arriving fact measure dimension dimension table degenerate slowly changing filling extract transform load etl extract transform load 160 using the data warehouse concepts business intelligence dashboard data mining decision support system dss olap cube languages data mining extensions dmx multidimensional expressions mdx xml for analysis xmla tools business intelligence tools reporting software spreadsheet 160 related people bill inmon ralph kimball products comparison of olap servers data warehousing products and their producers edit see also book enterprise architecture enterprise architecture this database related article is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e
