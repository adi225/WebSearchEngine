web abbreviated as www or w3 2 commonly known as the web is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the internet with a web browser one can view web pages that may contain text images videos and other multimedia and navigate between them via hyperlinks using concepts from his earlier hypertext systems like enquire british engineer computer scientist and at that time employee of cern sir tim berners lee now director of the world wide web consortium w3c wrote a proposal in march 1989 for what would eventually become the world wide web 1 at cern a european research organisation near geneva situated on swiss and french soil 3 berners lee and belgian computer scientist robert cailliau proposed in 1990 to use hypertext to link and access information of various kinds as a web of

a server do not power it down in the may 1970 issue of popular science magazine arthur c clarke predicted that satellites would someday bring the accumulated knowledge of the world to your fingertips using a console that would combine the functionality of the photocopier telephone television and a small computer allowing data transfer and video conferencing around the globe 6 in march 1989 tim berners lee wrote a proposal that referenced enquire a database and software project he had built in 1980 and described a more elaborate information management system 7 with help from robert cailliau he published a more formal proposal on 12 november 1990 to build a hypertext project called worldwideweb one word also w3 as a web of hypertext documents to be viewed by browsers using a client server architecture 4 this proposal estimated that a read only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six months to achieve the creation of new links and new material by readers so that authorship becomes universal as well as the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest to him her has become available while the read only goal was met accessible authorship of web content took longer to mature with the wiki concept blogs web 2 0 and rss atom 8 the proposal was modeled after the dynatext sgml reader by electronic book technology a spin off from the institute for research in information and scholarship at brown university the dynatext system licensed by cern was technically advanced and was a key player in the extension of sgml iso 8879 1986 to hypermedia within hytime but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics community namely a fee for each document and each document alteration the cern datacenter in 2010 housing some www servers a next computer was used by berners lee as the world s first web server and also to write the first web browser worldwideweb in 1990 by christmas 1990 berners lee had built all the tools necessary for a working web 9 the first web browser which was a web editor as well the first web server and the first web pages 10 which described the project itself on 6 august 1991 he posted a short summary of the world wide web project on the alt hypertext newsgroup 11 this date also marked the debut of the web as a publicly available service on the internet many newsmedia have reported that the first photo on the web was uploaded by berners lee in 1992 an image of the cern house band les horribles cernettes taken by silvano de gennaro gennaro has disclaimed this story writing that media were totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism 12 the first server outside europe was set up at the stanford linear accelerator center slac in palo alto california to host the spires hep database accounts differ substantially as to the date of this event the world wide web consortium says december 1992 13 whereas slac itself claims 1991 14 15 this is supported by a w3c document titled a little history of the world wide web 16 the crucial underlying concept of hypertext originated with older projects from the 1960s such as the hypertext editing system hes at brown university ted nelson s project xanadu and douglas engelbart s on line system nls both nelson and engelbart were in turn inspired by vannevar bush s microfilm based memex which was described in the 1945 essay as we may think 17 berners lee s breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the internet in his book weaving the web he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of both technical communities but when no one took up his invitation he finally tackled the project himself in the process he developed three essential technologies a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the web and elsewhere the universal document identifier udi later known as uniform resource locator url and uniform resource identifier uri the publishing language hypertext markup language html the hypertext transfer protocol http 18 the world wide web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems that were then available the web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones this made it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource it also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers in comparison to earlier systems but in turn presented the chronic problem of link rot unlike predecessors such as hypercard the world wide web was non proprietary making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions on 30 april 1993 cern announced that the world wide web would be free to anyone with no fees due 19 coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the gopher protocol was no longer free to use this produced a rapid shift away from gopher and towards the web an early popular web browser was violawww for unix and the x windowing system robert cailliau jean fran ois abramatic of ibm and tim berners lee at the 10th anniversary of the world wide web consortium scholars generally agree that a turning point for the world wide web began with the introduction 20 of the mosaic web browser 21 in 1993 a graphical browser developed by a team at the national center for supercomputing applications at the university of illinois at urbana champaign ncsa uiuc led by marc andreessen funding for mosaic came from the u s high performance computing and communications initiative and the high performance computing and communication act of 1991 one of several computing developments initiated by u s senator al gore 22 prior to the release of mosaic graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the web s popularity was less than older protocols in use over the internet such as gopher and wide area information servers wais mosaic s graphical user interface allowed the web to become by far the most popular internet protocol the world wide web consortium w3c was founded by tim berners lee after he left the european organization for nuclear research cern in october 1994 it was founded at the massachusetts institute of technology laboratory for computer science mit lcs with support from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa which had pioneered the internet a year later a second site was founded at inria a french national computer research lab with support from the european commission dg infso and in 1996 a third continental site was created in japan at keio university by the end of 1994 while the total number of websites was still minute compared to present standards quite a number of notable websites were already active many of which are the precursors or inspiration for today s most popular services connected by the existing internet other websites were created around the world adding international standards for domain names and html since then berners lee has played an active role in guiding the development of web standards such as the markup languages in which web pages are composed and in recent years has advocated his vision of a semantic web the world wide web enabled the spread of information over the internet through an easy to use and flexible format it thus played an important role in popularizing use of the internet 23 although the two terms are sometimes conflated in popular use world wide web is not synonymous with internet 24 the web is a collection of documents and both client and server software using internet protocols such as tcp ip and http tim berners lee was knighted in 2004 by queen elizabeth ii for his contribution to the world wide web edit function the terms internet and world wide web are often used in everyday speech without much distinction however the internet and the world wide web are not the same the internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks in contrast the web is one of the services that runs on the internet it is a collection of text documents and other resources linked by hyperlinks and urls usually accessed by web browsers from web servers in short the web can be thought of as an application running on the internet 25 viewing a web page on the world wide web normally begins either by typing the url of the page into a web browser or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource the web browser then initiates a series of communication messages behind the scenes in order to fetch and display it as an example consider accessing a page with the url http example org wiki world wide web first the browser resolves the server name portion of the url example org into an internet protocol address using the globally distributed database known as the domain name system dns this lookup returns an ip address such as 208 80 152 2 the browser then requests the resource by sending an http request across the internet to the computer at that particular address it makes the request to a particular application port in the underlying internet protocol suite so that the computer receiving the request can distinguish an http request from other network protocols it may be servicing such as e mail delivery the http protocol normally uses port 80 the content of the http request can be as simple as the two lines of text get wiki world wide web http 1 1 host example org the computer receiving the http request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80 if the web server can fulfill the request it sends an http response back to the browser indicating success which can be as simple as http 1 0 200 ok content type text html charset utf 8 followed by the content of the requested page the hypertext markup language for a basic web page looks like lt html gt lt head gt lt title gt example org the world wide web lt title gt lt head gt lt body gt lt p gt the world wide web abbreviated as www and commonly known lt p gt lt body gt lt html gt the web browser parses the html interpreting the markup lt title gt lt p gt for paragraph and such that surrounds the words in order to draw the text on the screen many web pages use html to reference the urls of other resources such as images other embedded media scripts that affect page behavior and cascading style sheets that affect page layout the browser will make additional http requests to the web server for these other internet media types as it receives their content from the web server the browser progressively renders the page onto the screen as specified by its html and these additional resources edit linking most web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files source documents definitions and other web resources in the underlying html a hyperlink looks like lt a href http example org wiki main page gt example org a free encyclopedia lt a gt graphic representation of a minute fraction of the www demonstrating hyperlinks such a collection of useful related resources interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a web of information publication on the internet created what tim berners lee first called the worldwideweb in its original camelcase which was subsequently discarded in november 1990 4 the hyperlink structure of the www is described by the webgraph the nodes of the webgraph correspond to the web pages or urls the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks over time many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear relocate or are replaced with different content this makes hyperlinks obsolete a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called dead links the ephemeral nature of the web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites the internet archive active since 1996 is the best known of such efforts edit dynamic updates of web pages main article ajax programming javascript is a scripting language that was initially developed in 1995 by brendan eich then of netscape for use within web pages 26 the standardised version is ecmascript 26 to make web pages more interactive some web applications also use javascript techniques such as ajax asynchronous javascript and xml client side script is delivered with the page that can make additional http requests to the server either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks or based on lapsed time the server s responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response so the server needs only to provide limited incremental information multiple ajax requests can be handled at the same time and users can interact with the page while data is being retrieved web pages may also regularly poll the server to check whether new information is available 27 edit www prefix many domain names used for the world wide web begin with www because of the long standing practice of naming internet hosts servers according to the services they provide the hostname for a web server is often www in the same way that it may be ftp for an ftp server and news or nntp for a usenet news server these host names appear as domain name system or domain name server dns subdomain names as in www example com the use of www as a subdomain name is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it indeed the first ever web server was called nxoc01 cern ch 28 according to paolo palazzi 29 who worked at cern along with tim berners lee the popular use of www subdomain was accidental the world wide web project page was intended to be published at www cern ch while info cern ch was intended to be the cern home page however the dns records were never switched and the practice of prepending www to an institution s website domain name was subsequently copied many established websites still use www or they invent other subdomain names such as www2 secure etc many such web servers are set up so that both the domain root e g example com and the www subdomain e g www example com refer to the same site others require one form or the other or they may map to different web sites the use of a subdomain name is useful for load balancing incoming web traffic by creating a cname record that points to a cluster of web servers since currently only a subdomain can be used in a cname the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root when a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix www to the beginning of it and possibly com org and net at the end depending on what might be missing for example entering microsoft may be transformed to http www microsoft com and openoffice to http www openoffice org this feature started appearing in early versions of mozilla firefox when it still had the working title firebird in early 2003 from an earlier practice in browsers such as lynx 30 it is reported that microsoft was granted a us patent for the same idea in 2008 but only for mobile devices 31 in english www is usually read as double u double u double u some users pronounce it dub dub dub particularly in new zealand stephen fry in his podgrammes series of podcasts pronouncing it wuh wuh wuh the english writer douglas adams once quipped in the independent on sunday 1999 the world wide web is the only thing i know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it s short for in mandarin chinese world wide web is commonly translated via a phono semantic matching to w n w i w ng which satisfies www and literally means myriad dimensional net 32 a translation that very appropriately reflects the design concept and proliferation of the world wide web tim berners lee s web space states that world wide web is officially spelled as three separate words each capitalised with no intervening hyphens 33 use of the www prefix is declining as web 2 0 web applications seek to brand their domain names and make them easily pronounceable 34 as the mobile web grows in popularity services like gmail com myspace com facebook com bebo com and twitter com are most often discussed without adding www to the domain or indeed the com edit scheme specifiers http and https the scheme specifier http or https at the start of a web uri refers to hypertext transfer protocol or http secure respectively unlike www which has no specific purpose these specify the communication protocol to be used for the request and response the http protocol is fundamental to the operation of the world wide web and the added encryption layer in https is essential when confidential information such as passwords or banking information are to be exchanged over the public internet web browsers usually prepend http to addresses too if omitted edit web servers main article web server the primary function of a web server is to deliver web pages on the request to clients this means delivery of html documents and any additional content that may be included by a document such as images style sheets and scripts edit privacy main article internet privacy every time a web page is requested from a web server the server can identify and usually it logs the ip address from which the request arrived equally unless set not to do so most web browsers record the web pages that have been requested and viewed in a history feature and usually cache much of the content locally unless https encryption is used web requests and responses travel in plain text across the internet and they can be viewed recorded and cached by intermediate systems when a web page asks for and the user supplies personally identifiable information such as their real name address e mail address etc then a connection can be made between the current web traffic and that individual if the website uses http cookies username and password authentication or other tracking techniques then it will be able to relate other web visits before and after to the identifiable information provided in this way it is possible for a web based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites it may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities their shopping interests their profession and other aspects of their demographic profile these profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers advertisers and others depending on the website s terms and conditions and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold shared or passed to other organisations without the user being informed for many ordinary people this means little more than some unexpected e mails in their in box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page for others it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome law enforcement counter terrorism and espionage agencies can also identify target and track individuals based on what appear to be their interests or proclivities on the web social networking sites make a point of trying to get the user to truthfully expose their real names interests and locations this makes the social networking experience more realistic and therefore engaging for all their users on the other hand photographs uploaded and unguarded statements made will be identified to the individual who may regret some decisions to publish these data employers schools parents and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences on line bullies may make use of personal information to harass or stalk users modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting but these can be complex and not easy to find or use especially for beginners 35 photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems as they can add a person s face to an on line profile with modern and potential facial recognition technology it may then be possible to relate that face with other previously anonymous images events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere because of image caching mirroring and copying it is difficult to remove an image from the world wide web edit intellectual property this section does not cite any references or sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed january 2013 main article intellectual property the intellectual property rights for any creative work initially rests with its creator web users who want to publish their work onto the world wide web however need to be aware of the details of the way they do it if artwork photographs writings poems or technical innovations are published by their creator onto a privately owned web server then they may choose the copyright and other conditions freely themselves this is unusual though more commonly work is uploaded to web sites and servers that are owned by other organizations it depends upon the terms and conditions of the site or service provider to what extent the original owner automatically signs over rights to their work by the choice of destination and by the act of uploading citation needed many users of the web erroneously assume that everything they may find on line is freely available to them as if it was in the public domain this is almost never the case unless the web site publishing the work clearly states that it is on the other hand content owners are aware of this widespread belief and expect that sooner or later almost everything that is published will probably be used in some capacity somewhere without their permission many publishers therefore embed visible or invisible digital watermarks in their media files sometimes charging users to receive unmarked copies for legitimate use digital rights management includes forms of access control technology that further limit the use of digital content even after it has been bought or downloaded citation needed edit security the web has become criminals preferred pathway for spreading malware cybercrime carried out on the web can include identity theft fraud espionage and intelligence gathering 36 web based vulnerabilities now outnumber traditional computer security concerns 37 38 and as measured by google about one in ten web pages may contain malicious code 39 most web based attacks take place on legitimate websites and most as measured by sophos are hosted in the united states china and russia 40 the most common of all malware threats is sql injection attacks against websites 41 through html and uris the web was vulnerable to attacks like cross site scripting xss that came with the introduction of javascript 42 and were exacerbated to some degree by web 2 0 and ajax web design that favors the use of scripts 43 today by one estimate 70 of all websites are open to xss attacks on their users 44 proposed solutions vary to extremes large security vendors like mcafee already design governance and compliance suites to meet post 9 11 regulations 45 and some like finjan have recommended active real time inspection of code and all content regardless of its source 36 some have argued that for enterprise to see security as a business opportunity rather than a cost center 46 ubiquitous always on digital rights management enforced in the infrastructure by a handful of organizations must replace the hundreds of companies that today secure data and networks 47 jonathan zittrain has said users sharing responsibility for computing safety is far preferable to locking down the internet 48 edit standards main article web standards many formal standards and other technical specifications and software define the operation of different aspects of the world wide web the internet and computer information exchange many of the documents are the work of the world wide web consortium w3c headed by berners lee but some are produced by the internet engineering task force ietf and other organizations usually when web standards are discussed the following publications are seen as foundational recommendations for markup languages especially html and xhtml from the w3c these define the structure and interpretation of hypertext documents recommendations for stylesheets especially css from the w3c standards for ecmascript usually in the form of javascript from ecma international recommendations for the document object model from w3c additional publications provide definitions of other essential technologies for the world wide web including but not limited to the following uniform resource identifier uri which is a universal system for referencing resources on the internet such as hypertext documents and images uris often called urls are defined by the ietf s rfc 3986 std 66 uniform resource identifier uri generic syntax as well as its predecessors and numerous uri scheme defining rfcs hypertext transfer protocol http especially as defined by rfc 2616 http 1 1 and rfc 2617 http authentication which specify how the browser and server authenticate each other edit accessibility main article web accessibility there are methods available for accessing the web in alternative mediums and formats so as to enable use by individuals with disabilities these disabilities may be visual auditory physical speech related cognitive neurological or some combination therin accessibility features also help others with temporary disabilities like a broken arm or the aging population as their abilities change 49 the web is used for receiving information as well as providing information and interacting with society the world wide web consortium claims it essential that the web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities 50 tim berners lee once noted the power of the web is in its universality access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect 49 many countries regulate web accessibility as a requirement for websites 51 international cooperation in the w3c web accessibility initiative led to simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the web accessible to persons who may or may not be using assistive technology 49 52 edit internationalization the w3c internationalization activity assures that web technology will work in all languages scripts and cultures 53 beginning in 2004 or 2005 unicode gained ground and eventually in december 2007 surpassed both ascii and western european as the web s most frequently used character encoding 54 originally rfc 3986 allowed resources to be identified by uri in a subset of us ascii rfc 3987 allows more characters any character in the universal character set and now a resource can be identified by iri in any language 55 edit statistics between 2005 and 2010 the number of web users doubled and was expected to surpass two billion in 2010 56 early studies in 1998 and 1999 estimating the size of the web using capture recapture methods showed that much of the web was not indexed by search engines and the web was much larger than expected 57 58 according to a 2001 study there were a massive number over 550 billion of documents on the web mostly in the invisible web or deep web 59 a 2002 survey of 2 024 million web pages 60 determined that by far the most web content was in the english language 56 4 next were pages in german 7 7 french 5 6 and japanese 4 9 a more recent study which used web searches in 75 different languages to sample the web determined that there were over 11 5 billion web pages in the publicly indexable web as of the end of january 2005 61 as of march 2009 update the indexable web contains at least 25 21 billion pages 62 on 25 july 2008 google software engineers jesse alpert and nissan hajaj announced that google search had discovered one trillion unique urls 63 as of may 2009 update over 109 5 million domains operated 64 not in citation given of these 74 were commercial or other sites operating in the com generic top level domain 64 statistics measuring a website s popularity are usually based either on the number of page views or on associated server hits file requests that it receives edit speed issues frustration over congestion issues in the internet infrastructure and the high latency that results in slow browsing has led to a pejorative name for the world wide web the world wide wait 65 speeding up the internet is an ongoing discussion over the use of peering and qos technologies other solutions to reduce the congestion can be found at w3c 66 guidelines for web response times are 67 0 1 second one tenth of a second ideal response time the user does not sense any interruption 1 second highest acceptable response time download times above 1 second interrupt the user experience 10 seconds unacceptable response time the user experience is interrupted and the user is likely to leave the site or system edit caching main article web cache if a user revisits a web page after only a short interval the page data may not need to be re obtained from the source web server almost all web browsers cache recently obtained data usually on the local hard drive http requests sent by a browser will usually ask only for data that has changed since the last download if the locally cached data are still current they will be reused caching helps reduce the amount of web traffic on the internet the decision about expiration is made independently for each downloaded file whether image stylesheet javascript html or other resource thus even on sites with highly dynamic content many of the basic resources need to be refreshed only occasionally web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as css data and javascript into a few site wide files so that they can be cached efficiently this helps reduce page download times and lowers demands on the web server there are other components of the internet that can cache web content corporate and academic firewalls often cache web resources requested by one user for the benefit of all see also caching proxy server some search engines also store cached content from websites apart from the facilities built into web servers that can determine when files have been updated and so need to be re sent designers of dynamically generated web pages can control the http headers sent back to requesting users so that transient or sensitive pages are not cached internet banking and news sites frequently use this facility data requested with an http get is likely to be cached if other conditions are met data obtained in response to a post is assumed to depend on the data that was posted and so is not cached edit see also internet portal electronic publishing lists of websites prestel streaming media web 1 0 webgraph edit references a b
