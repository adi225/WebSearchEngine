the mozilla firefox address bar showing a url with the query string title main page amp action raw in the world wide web a query string is the part of a uniform resource locator url that contains data to be passed to web applications such as cgi programs when a web page is requested via the hypertext transfer protocol the server locates a file in its file system based on the requested url this file may be a regular file or a program in the second case the server may depending on its configuration run the program sending its output as the requested page the query string is a part of the url which is passed to the program its use permits data to be passed from the http client often a web browser to the program which generates the web page contents 1 structure 1 1 web forms 1 2 server side image

containing a query string is as follows http server path program query string when a server receives a request for such a page it may run a program passing the query string unchanged to the program the question mark is used as a separator and is not part of the query string 1 2 a link in a web page may have a url that contains a query string however html defines three ways a web browser can generate the query string an html form via the lt form gt lt form gt element a server side image map via the ismap attribute on the lt img gt element with a lt a gt lt img ismap gt lt a gt construction an indexed search via the now deprecated lt isindex gt element edit web forms the main use of query strings is to contain the content of an html form also known as web form in particular when a form containing the fields field 1 field 2 field 3 is submitted the content of the fields is encoded as a query string as follows field 1 value 1 amp field 2 value 2 amp field 3 value 3 the query string is composed of a series of field value pairs within each pair the field name and value are separated by an equals sign the equals sign may be omitted if the value is an empty string the series of pairs is separated by the ampersand amp or semicolon for urls embedded in html and not generated by a lt form gt lt form gt see below while there is no definitive standard most web frameworks allow multiple values to be associated with a single field 3 4 field 1 value 1 amp field 1 value 2 amp field 1 value 3 for each field of the form the query string contains a pair field value web forms may include fields that are not visible to the user these fields are included in the query string when the form is submitted this convention is a w3c recommendation 5 w3c recommends that all web servers support semicolon separators in addition to ampersand separators 6 to allow application x www form urlencoded query strings in urls within html documents without having to entity escape ampersands technically the form content is only encoded as a query string when the form submission method is get the same encoding is used by default when the submission method is post but the result is not sent as a query string that is is not added to the action url of the form rather the string is sent as the body of the http request 7 edit server side image maps see also image map edit indexed search this section is empty you can help by adding to it june 2012 edit other this section is empty you can help by adding to it june 2012 edit url encoding main article percent encoding some characters cannot be part of a url for example the space and some other characters have a special meaning in a url for example the character can be used to further specify a subsection or fragment of a document the character is used to separate a name from a value a query string may need to be converted to satisfy these constraints this can be done using a schema known as url encoding in particular encoding the query string uses the following rules letters a z and a z numbers 0 9 and the characters and are left as is space is encoded as or 160 20 citation needed all other characters are encoded as 160 ff hex representation with any non ascii characters first encoded as utf 8 or other specified encoding the octet corresponding to the tilde character is often encoded as 7e by older uri processing implementations the 7e can be replaced by without changing its interpretation the encoding of space as and the selection of as is characters distinguishes this encoding from rfc 1738 edit rfc as defined in rfc 1738 a url of scheme http can contain a searchpart following the rest of the url and separated from it by a character rfc 3986 specifies that the query component of a uri is the part between the and the end of the uri or the character the term query string is of common usage for referring to this part for the case of http urls edit example if a form is embedded in an html page as follows lt form action cgi bin test cgi method get gt lt input type text name first gt lt input type text name second gt lt input type submit gt lt form gt and the user inserts the strings this is a field and was it clear already in the two text fields and presses the submit button the program test cgi will receive the following query string first this is a field amp second was it clear 28already 29 3f if the form is processed on the server by a cgi script the script may typically receive the query string as an environment variable named query string edit tracking a program receiving a query string can ignore part or all of it if the requested url corresponds to a file and not to a program the whole query string is ignored however regardless of whether the query string is used or not the whole url including it is stored in the server log files these facts allow query strings to be used to track users in a manner similar to that provided by http cookies for this to work every time the user downloads a page a unique identifier must be chosen and added as a query string to the urls of all links the page contains as soon as the user follows one of these links the corresponding url is requested to the server this way the download of this page is linked with the previous one for example when a web page containing the following is requested lt a href foo html gt see my page lt a gt lt a href bar html gt mine is better lt a gt a unique string such as e0a72cb2a2c7 is chosen and the page is modified as follows lt a href foo html e0a72cb2a2c7 gt see my page lt a gt lt a href bar html e0a72cb2a2c7 gt mine is better lt a gt the addition of the query string does not change the way the page is shown to the user when the user follows for example the first link the browser requests the page foo html e0a72cb2a2c7 to the server which ignores what follows and sends the page foo html as expected adding the query string to its links as well this way any subsequent page request from this user will carry the same query string e0a72cb2a2c7 making it possible to establish that all these pages have been viewed by the same user query strings are often used in association with web beacons the main differences between query strings used for tracking and http cookies are that query strings form part of the url and are therefore included if the user saves or sends the url to another user cookies can be maintained across browsing sessions but are not saved or sent with the url if the user arrives at the same web server by two or more independent paths it will be assigned two different query strings while the stored cookies are the same the user can disable cookies in which case using cookies for tracking does not work however using query strings for tracking should work in all situations edit flexibility vs security a url query string allows for flexibility in retrieving data from a web server and possibly from the database used to populate pages for that web server a read only data store such as a weather mapping service is one example where url query strings can be used with great flexibility in some circumstances a url query string may expose security issues because it can be edited by a user to retrieve data that they do not have access to in particular a url query string containing a username and password could be used with a dictionary attack to guess at valid login credentials to a particular web site this concern is not specific to query strings form data submitted via post can also be similarly retrieved and edited by the user with the appropriate browser extensions most secure webservers use at least md5 hash checking or more powerful encoding methods to validate all given strings edit compatibility issues according to the http specification servers should be cautious about depending on uri which includes urls lengths above 255 bytes because some older client or proxy implementations may not properly support these lengths 8 the html 3 specification declares that any attribute value e g url in lt a href url gt cannot have more than 1024 characters 9 however the html 4 specification omits this restriction 10 the specification does not dictate a minimum or maximum url length but implementation varies by browser and version for example internet explorer does not support urls that have more than 2083 characters 11 12 there is no limit on the number of parameters in a url only the raw as opposed to url encoded character length of the url matters web servers may also impose limits on the length of the query string depending on how the url and query string is stored if the url is too long the web server fails with the 414 request uri too long http status code the common workaround for these problems is to use post instead of get and store the parameters in the request body the length limits on request bodies are typically much higher than those on url length for example the limit on post size by default is 2 mb on iis 4 0 and 128 kb on iis 5 0 13 the limit is configurable on apache2 using the limitrequestbody directive which specifies the number of bytes from 0 meaning unlimited to 2147483647 2gb that are allowed in a request body 14 edit see also clean urls common gateway interface http cookie hypertext transfer protocol uri scheme web beacon edit references rfc
