data science and analytics professionals in the industry it consists of approximately 50 multiple choice and open ended questions that cover seven general areas of data mining science and practice 1 field and goals 2 algorithms 3 models 4 tools software packages used 5 technology 6 challenges and 7 future it is conducted as a service without corporate sponsorship to the data mining community and the results are usually announced at the paw predictive analytics world conferences and shared via freely available summary reports in the most recent survey 2011 1319 data miners from over 60 countries participated 1 after 2011 rexer analytics moved to a biannual schedule the next data miner survey is scheduled to be launched in early 2013 contents 1 surveys 2 recent survey results 3

topics that get the most attention in citations and at conference presentations are algorithms each year the surveys have consistently shown that decision trees regression and cluster analysis form a triad of core algorithms for most data miners however a wide variety of algorithms are being used this is consistent with independent polls of data miners conducted by kdnuggets over the years 22 23 data mining tools data miners report using an average of four software tool to conduct their analyses over the survey years r has risen in popularity in 2010 it overtook spss statistics and sas to become the tool used by the most data miners and the 2011 survey showed that r is now being used by close to half of all data miners 47 statistica has also grown in popularity from 2007 2009 more data miners indicated that spss clementine now ibm spss modeler was their primary data mining tool than any other tool however in 2010 and 2011 statistica was cited most frequently as data miners primary tool in terms of satisfaction with their tools in the past few years statistica spss modeler r knime rapidminer and salford systems have received the strongest satisfaction ratings from data miners in these surveys the growing popularity of r is consistent with independent polls of data miners conducted by kdnuggets but the kdnuggets polls show a different picture regarding the popularity of commercial data mining software 24 25 26 robert muenchen has taken a multi faceted approach to assessing the popularity of data analysis software an approach that includes blog post counts google scholar data listserv subscribers use in competitions book publications google pagerank and more 12 his analyses are consistent with the rexer analytics surveys and kdnuggets in outlining the growth of r but muenchen illustrates that the popularity of software is more nuanced and one s conclusions will be different depending on what measure of popularity is used the rexer analytics survey summary reports include analyses of the data miners satisfaction with 20 dimensions of their software haughton et al and nisbet have also produced reviews of data mining software 27 28 challenges consistently across the years dirty data explaining data mining to others and difficult access to data are the top challenges data miners report facing participants in the 2010 survey shared best practices for overcoming these challenges 29 edit references a b karl rexer heather allen amp paul gearan 2011 2011 data miner survey summary presented at predictive analytics world oct 2011 bob thompson 2012 big
