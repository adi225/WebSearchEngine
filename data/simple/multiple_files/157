data dredging data fishing data snooping is the inappropriate sometimes deliberately so use of data mining to uncover misleading relationships in data data snooping bias is a form of statistical bias that arises from this misuse of statistics any relationships found might appear valid within the test set but they would have no statistical significance in the wider population data dredging and data snooping bias can occur when researchers either do not form a hypothesis in advance or narrow the data used to reduce the probability of the sample refuting a specific hypothesis although data snooping bias can occur in any field that uses data mining it is of particular concern in finance and medical research which both heavily use data mining the process of data mining involves automatically testing huge numbers of hypotheses about a single data set by exhaustively searching for combinations of variables that might show a correlation conventional tests of statistical significance are based on the probability that an observation arose by chance and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken test results called the significance when large numbers of tests are performed some produce false results hence 5 of randomly chosen hypotheses turn out to be significant at the 5 level 1 turn out to be significant at the 1 significance level and so on by chance alone this and a comic example http imgs xkcd com comics significant png exemplify the multiple comparisons hazard in data dredging there is no overall effect of jelly beans on acne also subgroups are sometimes explored without alerting the reader to the number of questions at issue which can lead to misinformed conclusions 1 when enough hypotheses are tested it is virtually certain that some falsely appear statistically significant since every data set with any degree of randomness contains some spurious correlations researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these apparently significant results even though they are mere artifacts of random variation circumventing the traditional scientific approach by conducting an experiment without a hypothesis can lead to premature conclusions data mining can be used negatively to seek more information from a data set than it actually contains failure to adjust existing statistical models when applying them to new datasets can also result in the occurrences of new patterns between different attributes that would otherwise have not shown up overfitting oversearching overestimation and attribute selection errors are all actions that can lead to data dredging contents 1 types of problem 1 1 drawing conclusions from data 1 2 hypothesis suggested by non representative data 1 3 bias 1 4 multiple modelling 1 5 example in meteorology 2 remedies 3 see also 4 references 5 further reading 6 external links edit types of problem edit drawing conclusions from data the conventional frequentist statistical hypothesis testing procedure is to formulate a research hypothesis such as people in higher social classes live longer then collect relevant data followed by carrying out a statistical significance test to see whether the results could be due to the effects of chance the last step is called testing against the null hypothesis a key point in proper statistical analysis is to test a hypothesis with evidence data that was not used in constructing the hypothesis this is critical because every data set contains some patterns due entirely to chance if the hypothesis is not tested on a different data set from the same population it is impossible to determine if the patterns found are chance patterns see testing hypotheses suggested by the data here is a simple example throwing a coin five times with a result of 2 heads and 3 tails might lead one to hypothesize that the coin favors tails by 3 5 to 2 5 if this hypothesis is then tested on the existing data set it is confirmed but the confirmation is meaningless the proper procedure would have been to form in advance a hypothesis of what the tails probability is and then throw the coin various times to see if the hypothesis is rejected or not if three tails and two heads are observed another hypothesis that the tails probability is 3 5 could be formed but it could only be tested by a new set of coin tosses it is important to realize that the statistical significance under the incorrect procedure is completely spurious significance tests do not protect against data dredging edit hypothesis suggested by non representative data main article testing hypotheses suggested by the data in a list of 367 people at least two have the same day and month of birth suppose mary and john both celebrate birthdays on august 7 data snooping would by design try to find additional similarities between mary and john such as are they the youngest and the oldest persons in the list have they met in person once twice three times do their fathers have the same first name or mothers have the same maiden name by going through hundreds or thousands of potential similarities between john and mary each having a low probability of being true we can almost certainly find some similarity between them perhaps john and mary are the only two persons in the list who switched minors three times in college a fact we found out by exhaustively comparing their lives histories our hypothesis biased by data snooping can then become people born on august 7 have a much higher chance of switching minors more than twice in college the data itself very strongly supports that correlation since no one with a different birthday had switched minors three times in college however when we turn to the larger sample of the general population and attempt to reproduce the results we find that there is no statistical correlation between august 7 birthdays and changing college minors more than once the fact exists only for a very small specific sample not for the public as a whole see also reproducible research edit bias main article bias bias is a systematic error in the analysis for example doctors directed hiv patients at high cardiovascular risk to a particular hiv treatment abacavir and lower risk patients to other drugs preventing a simple assessment of abacavir compared to other treatments an analysis that did not correct for this bias unfairly penalised the abacavir since its patients were more high risk so more of them had heart attacks 1 this problem can be very severe for example in the observational study 1 2 missing factors unmeasured confounders and loss to follow up can also lead to bias 1 by selecting papers with a significant p value negative studies are selected against which is the publication bias edit multiple modelling another aspect of the conditioning of statistical tests by knowledge of the data can be seen while using the frequent in the data analysis linear regression a crucial step in the process is to decide which covariates to include in a relationship explaining one or more other variables there are both statistical see stepwise regression and substantive considerations that lead the authors to favor some of their models over others and there is a liberal use of statistical tests however to discard one or more variables from an explanatory relation on the basis of the data means one cannot validly apply standard statistical procedures to the retained variables in the relation as though nothing had happened in the nature of the case the retained variables have had to pass some kind of preliminary test possibly an imprecise intuitive one that the discarded variables failed in 1966 selvin and stuart compared variables retained in the model to the fish that don t fall through the net in the sense that their effects are bound to be bigger than those that do fall through the net not only does this alter the performance of all subsequent tests on the retained explanatory model it may introduce bias and alter mean square error in estimation 3 4 edit example in meteorology in meteorology dataset a is often weather data up to the present which ensures that even subconsciously subset b of the data could not influence the formulation of the hypothesis of course such a discipline necessitates waiting for new data to come in to show the formulated theory s predictive power versus the null hypothesis this process ensures that no one can accuse the researcher of hand tailoring the predictive model to the data on hand since the upcoming weather is not yet available suppose that observers note that a particular town appears to have a cancer cluster but lack a firm hypothesis of why this is so however they have access to a large amount of demographic data about the town and surrounding area containing measurements for the area of hundreds or thousands of different variables mostly uncorrelated even if all these variables are independent of the cancer incidence rate it is highly likely that at least one variable correlates significantly with the cancer rate across the area while this may suggest a hypothesis further testing using the same variables but with data from a different location is needed to confirm note that a p value of 0 01 suggests that 1 of the time a result at least that extreme would be obtained by chance if hundreds or thousands of hypotheses with mutually relatively uncorrelated independent variables are tested then one is more likely than not to get at least one null hypothesis with a p value less than 0 01 edit remedies looking for patterns in data is legitimate applying a statistical test of significance hypothesis testing to the same data the pattern was learned from is wrong one way to construct hypotheses while avoiding data dredging is to conduct randomized out of sample tests the researcher collects a data set then randomly partitions it into two subsets a and b only one subset say subset a is examined for creating hypotheses once a hypothesis is formulated it must be tested on subset b which was not used to construct the hypothesis only where b also supports such a hypothesis is it reasonable to believe the hypothesis might be valid another remedy for data dredging is to record the number of all significance tests conducted during the experiment and simply multiply the final significance level by this number the bonferroni correction however this is a very conservative metric methods particularly useful in analysis of variance and in constructing simultaneous confidence bands for regressions involving basis functions are the scheff s method and if the researcher has in mind only pairwise comparisons the tukey method the use of a false discovery rate is a more sophisticated approach that has become a popular method for control of multiple hypothesis tests when neither approach is practical one can make a clear distinction between data analyses that are confirmatory and analyses that are exploratory statistical inference is appropriate only for the former 4 ultimately the statistical significance of a test and the statistical confidence of a finding are joint properties of data and the method used to examine the data thus if someone says that a certain event has probability of 20 2 19 times out of 20 this means that if the probability of the event is estimated by the same method used to obtain the 20 estimate the result is between 18 and 22 with probability 0 95 no claim of statistical significance can be made by only looking without due regard to the method used to assess the data edit see also base rate fallacy bonferroni inequalities pareidolia predictive analytics misuse of statistics edit references a b c d
