external links edit etymology the prefix hyper comes from the greek prefix and means over or beyond while having common origins with the english word super signifies the overcoming of the old linear constraints of written text the term hypertext is often used where the term hypermedia might seem appropriate in 1992 author ted nelson 160 who coined both terms in 1963 160 wrote by now the word hypertext has become generally accepted for branching and responding text but the corresponding word hypermedia meaning complexes of branching and responding graphics movies and sound 160 as well as text 160 is much less used instead they use the strange term interactive multimedia this is four syllables longer and does not express the idea of extending hypertext nelson literary machines 1992 edit types and uses of hypertext hypertext documents can either be static prepared and stored in advance or dynamic continually changing in response to user input such as dynamic web pages static hypertext can be used to cross reference collections of data in documents software applications or books on cds a well constructed system can also incorporate other user interface conventions such as menus and command lines links used in a hypertext document usually replace the current piece of hypertext with the destination document a less known and used feature is stretchtext which expands or contracts the content in place giving more control to the reader in determining the level of detail of the displayed document hypertext can develop very complex and dynamic systems of linking and cross referencing the most famous implementation of hypertext is the world wide web first deployed in 1992 edit history main article history of hypertext in 1941 jorge luis borges created the garden of forking paths a branching style short story that is often considered an inspiration for the concept of hypertext 2 in 1945 vannevar bush wrote an article in the atlantic monthly called as we may think about a futuristic proto hypertext device he called a memex this was a microfiche that stopped where you told it to but not a punctuation nor a network document standard ted nelson gives a presentation on project xanadu in 1963 ted nelson coined the terms hypertext and hypermedia in a model he developed for creating and using linked content first published reference 1965 3 he later worked with andries van dam to develop the hypertext editing system text editing in 1967 at brown university douglas engelbart independently began working on his nls system in 1962 at stanford research institute although delays in obtaining funding personnel and equipment meant that its key features were not completed until 1968 in december of that year engelbart demonstrated a hypertext meaning editing interface to the public for the first time in what has come to be known as the mother of all demos the word processor had been born the first hypermedia application was the aspen movie map in 1977 this allowed users to choose which way they wanted to drive in a virtual cityscape in 1980 tim berners lee created enquire an early hypertext database system somewhat like a wiki but without hypertext punctuation which was not invented until 1987 the early 1980s also saw a number of experimental hyperediting functions in word processors and hypermedia programs many of whose features and terminology were later analogous to the world wide web guide the first significant hypertext system for personal computers was developed by peter j brown at ukc in 1982 in august 1987 apple computer released hypercard for the macintosh line at the macworld convention its impact combined with interest in peter j brown s guide marketed by owl and released earlier that year and brown university s intermedia led to broad interest in and enthusiasm for databases and new media the first acm hypertext hyperediting and databases academic conference took place in november 1987 in chapel hill nc where many other applications including the branched literature writing software storyspace were also demonstrated 4 meanwhile nelson who had been working on and advocating his xanadu system for over two decades along with the commercial success of hypercard stirred autodesk to invest in his revolutionary ideas the project continued at autodesk for four years but no product was released in 1990 tim berners lee then a scientist at cern proposed and later prototyped a new hypertext project in response to a request for a simple immediate information sharing facility to be used among physicists working at cern and other academic institutions he called the project worldwideweb 5 hypertext is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will potentially hypertext provides a single user interface to many large classes of stored information such as reports notes data bases computer documentation and on line systems help we propose the implementation of a simple scheme to incorporate several different servers of machine stored information already available at cern including an analysis of the requirements for information access needs by experiments a program which provides access to the hypertext world we call a browser t berners lee r cailliau 12 november 1990 cern 5 in 1992 lynx was born as an early internet web browser its ability to provide hypertext links within documents that could reach into documents anywhere on the internet began the creation of the web on the internet as new web browsers were released traffic on the world wide web quickly exploded from only 500 known web servers in 1993 to over 10 000 in 1994 as a result all previous hypertext systems were overshadowed by the success of the web even though it originally lacked many features of those earlier systems such as an easy way to edit what you were reading edit implementations besides the already mentioned project xanadu hypertext editing system nls hypercard and world wide web there are other noteworthy early implementations of hypertext with different feature sets hypertext editing system hes ibm 2250 display

hypertext development software and the emergence of electronic networks two software programs specifically designed for literary hypertext storyspace and intermedia became available in the 1990s storyspace 2 0 a professional level hypertext development tool is available from eastgate systems which has also published many notable works of electronic literature including michael joyce s afternoon a story shelley jackson s patchwork girl stuart moulthrop s victory garden and judy malloy s its name was penelope forward anywhere other works include julio cort zar s rayuela and milorad pavi s dictionary of the khazars the first italian hypertextual novel by lorenzo miglioli ra dio was written using storyspace an advantage of writing a narrative using hypertext technology is that the meaning of the story can be conveyed through a sense of spatiality and perspective that is arguably unique to digitally networked environments an author s creative use of nodes the self contained units of meaning in a hypertextual narrative can play with the reader s orientation and add meaning to the text one of the most successful computer games of all time myst was first written in hypercard the game was constructed as a series of ages each age consisting of a separate hypercard stack the full stack of the game consists of over 2500 cards in some ways myst redefined interactive fiction using puzzles and exploration as a replacement for hypertextual narrative 6 critics of hypertext claim that it inhibits the old linear reader experience by creating several different tracks to read on and that this in turn contributes to a postmodernist fragmentation of worlds in some cases hypertext may be detrimental to the development of appealing stories in the case of hypertext gamebooks where ease of linking fragments may lead to non cohesive or incomprehensible narratives 7 however they do see value in its ability to present several different views on the same subject in a simple way 8 this echoes the arguments of medium theorists like marshall mcluhan who look at the social and psychological impacts of the media new media can become so dominant in public culture that they effectively create a paradigm shift lelia green 2001 15 as people have shifted their perceptions understanding of the world and ways of interacting with the world and each other in relation to new technologies and media so hypertext signifies a change from linear structured and hierarchical forms of representing and understanding the world into fractured decentralized and changeable media
