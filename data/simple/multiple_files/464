that contains digital information represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions now obsolete as a recording medium punched cards were widely used throughout the 19th century for controlling textile looms and in the late 19th and early 20th century for operating fairground organs and related instruments they were used through the 20th century in unit record machines for input processing and data storage early digital computers used punched cards often prepared using keypunch machines as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data some voting

organ punched cards were first used around 1725 by basile bouchon and jean baptiste falcon as a more robust form of the perforated paper rolls then in use for controlling textile looms in france this technique was greatly improved by joseph marie jacquard in his jacquard loom in 1801 semen korsakov was reputedly the first to use the punched cards in informatics for information store and search korsakov announced his new method and machines in september 1832 and rather than seeking patents offered the machines for public use 2 semen korsakov s punched card charles babbage proposed the use of number cards pierced with certain holes and stand opposite levers connected with a set of figure wheels advanced they push in those levers opposite to which there are no holes on the card and thus transfer that number in his description of the calculating engine s store 3 herman hollerith invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine prior uses of machine readable media such as those above other than korsakov had been for control not data after some initial trials with paper tape he settled on punched cards 4 developing punched card data processing technology for the 1890 us census he founded the tabulating machine company 1896 which was one of four companies that merged to form computing tabulating recording company ctr later renamed ibm ibm manufactured and marketed a variety of unit record machines for creating sorting and tabulating punched cards even after expanding into electronic computers in the late 1950s ibm developed punched card technology into a powerful tool for business data processing and produced an extensive line of general purpose unit record machines by 1950 the ibm card and ibm unit record machines had become ubiquitous in industry and government do not fold spindle or mutilate a generalized version of the warning that appeared on some punched cards generally on those distributed as paper documents to be later returned for further machine processing checks for example became a motto for the post world war ii era 5 from the 1900s into the 1950s punched cards were the primary medium for data entry data storage and processing in institutional computing according to the ibm archives by 1937 ibm had 32 presses at work in endicott n y printing cutting and stacking five to 10 million punched cards every day 6 punched cards were even used as legal documents such as u s government checks 7 and savings bonds the unityper introduced magnetic tape for data entry in the 1950s during the 1960s the punched card was gradually replaced as the primary means for data storage by magnetic tape as better more capable computers became available mohawk data sciences introduced a magnetic tape encoder in 1965 a system marketed as a keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful but punched cards were still commonly used for data entry and programming until the mid 1980s when the combination of lower cost magnetic disk storage and affordable interactive terminals on less expensive minicomputers made punched cards obsolete for this role as well 8 however their influence lives on through many standard conventions and file formats the terminals that replaced the punched cards the ibm 3270 for example displayed 80 columns of text in text mode for compatibility with existing software some programs still operate on the convention of 80 text columns although fewer and fewer do as newer systems employ graphical user interfaces with variable width type fonts today punched cards are mostly obsolete and replaced with other storage methods except for a few legacy systems and specialized applications edit nomenclature the terms punched card punch card and punchcard were all commonly used as were ibm card and hollerith card after herman hollerith ibm used ibm card 9 or later punched card at first mention in its documentation and thereafter simply card or cards 10 the term punched card was generally avoided for blank cards with other terms such as tabulating card or tab card used 11 specific formats were often indicated by the number of character positions available e g 80 column card a group of cards is called a card deck or simply deck the rectangular round or oval bits of paper punched out are called chad recently chads or chips in ibm usage multi character data such as words or large numbers were stored in adjacent card columns known as fields edit card formats the first application of hollerith s punched cards the 1890 us census used blank cards 12 following that cards commonly had printing such that the row and column position of a hole could be identified for some applications printing might have included fields named and marked by vertical lines logos and more 13 general purpose layouts see for example the ibm 5081 below were also available some cards had one upper corner cut so that cards not oriented correctly or cards with different corner cuts could be easily identified edit hollerith s punched card formats hollerith card as shown in the railroad gazette in 1885 14 herman hollerith was awarded a series of patents 15 in 1889 for mechanical tabulating machines these patents described both paper tape and rectangular cards as possible recording media the card shown in u s patent 395 781 of june 8 was preprinted with a template and had holes arranged close to the edges so they could be reached by a railroad conductor s ticket punch with the center reserved for written descriptions hollerith was originally inspired by railroad tickets that let the conductor encode a rough description of the passenger i was traveling in the west and i had a ticket with what i think was called a punch photograph the conductor punched out a description of the individual as light hair dark eyes large nose etc so you see i only made a punch photograph of each person 16 use of the ticket punch proved tiring and error prone so hollerith invented a pantograph keyboard punch that allowed the entire card area to be used it also eliminated the need for a printed template on each card instead a master template was used at the punch a printed reading board could be placed under a card that was to be read manually hollerith envisioned a number of card sizes in an article he wrote describing his proposed system for tabulating the 1890 u s census hollerith suggested a card 3 160 inches by 5 inches of manila stock would be sufficient to answer all ordinary purposes 17 the cards used in the 1890 census had round holes 12 rows and 24 columns a reading board for these cards can be seen at the columbia university computing history site 18 at some point 3 1 4 by 7 3 8 inches 82 550 by 187 325 mm became the standard card size a bit larger than the united states one dollar bill of the time the dollar was changed to its current size in 1929 the columbia site says hollerith took advantage of available boxes designed to transport paper currency hollerith s original system used an ad hoc coding system for each application with groups of holes assigned specific meanings e g sex or marital status his tabulating machine had up to 40 counters each with a dial divided into 100 divisions with two indicator hands one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution this arrangement allowed a count up to 10 000 during a given tabulating run each counter was typically assigned a specific hole hollerith also used relay logic to allow counts of combination of holes e g to count married females 17 later designs standardized the coding with twelve rows where the lower ten rows coded digits 0 through 9 this allowed groups of holes to represent numbers that could be added instead of simply counting units hollerith s 45 column punched cards are illustrated in comrie s the application of the hollerith tabulating machine to brown s tables of the moon 19 20 edit ibm 80 column punched card formats and character codes card from a fortran program z 1 y w 1 this ibm card format designed in 1928 21 had rectangular holes 80 columns with 12 punch locations each one character to each column card size was exactly 7 3 8 by 3 1 4 inches 187 325 160 mm 160 82 55 160 mm the cards were made of smooth stock 0 007 inches 180 160 m thick there are about 143 cards to the inch 56 cm in 1964 ibm changed from square to round corners 22 they came typically in boxes of 2000 cards 23 or as continuous form cards continuous form cards could be both pre numbered and pre punched for document control checks for example 24 the lower ten positions represented from top to bottom the digits 0 through 9 the top two positions of a column were called zone punches 12 top and 11 originally only numeric information was punched with 1 punch per column indicating the digit signs could be added to a field by overpunching the least significant digit with a zone punch 12 for plus and 11 for minus zone punches had other uses in processing as well such as indicating a master record amp 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqr stuvwxyz y x xxxxxxxxx x x xxxxxxxxx 0 x

card in 1931 ibm began introducing multiple punches for upper case letters and special characters 26 27 a letter had two punches zone 12 11 0 digit 1 9 most special characters had two or three punches zone 12 11 0 or none digit 2 7 8 a few special characters were exceptions in ebcdic amp was 12 only was 11 only and was 0 1 with these changes the information represented in a column by a combination of zones 12 11 and digits 1 9 was dependent on the use of that column for example the combination 12 1 was the letter a in an alphabetic column a plus signed digit 1 in a signed numeric column or an unsigned digit 1 in a column where the 12 had some other use the introduction of ebcdic in 1964 allowed columns with as many as six punches zones 12 11 0 8 9 digit 1 7 ibm and other manufacturers used many different 80 column card character encodings 28 29 a 1969 american national standard defined the punches for 128 characters and was named the hollerith punched card code often referred to simply as hollerith card code honoring hollerith 30 a general purpose punched card from late twentieth century standard 5081 card from a non ibm manufacturer the corners have been worn down for some computer applications binary formats were used where each hole represented a single binary digit or bit every column or row was treated as a simple bitfield and every combination of holes was permitted for example the ibm 711 card reader used with the 704 709 7090 7094 series scientific computers treated every row as two 36 bit words ignoring 8 columns the specific 72 columns used were selectable using a plugboard control panel which was almost always wired to select columns 1 72 sometimes the ignored columns usually 73 80 were used to contain a sequence number for each card so the card deck could be sorted to the correct order in case it was dropped other computers such as the ibm 1130 or system 360 used every column the ibm 1402 could be used in column binary mode which stored two characters in every column or one 36 bit word in three columns however most of the older card punches were not intended to punch more than 3 holes in a column so they couldn t be used to produce binary cards as a prank in binary mode cards could be punched where every possible punch position had a hole such lace cards lacked structural strength and would frequently buckle and jam inside the machine the 80 column card format dominated the industry becoming known as just ibm cards even though other companies made cards and equipment to process them one of the most common printed punched cards was the ibm 5081 a general purpose layout with no field divisions other card vendors manufactured cards with that same layout and number even users knew its number edit mark sense cards mark sense electrographic cards developed by reynold b johnson at ibm had printed ovals that could be marked with a special electrographic pencil cards would typically be punched with some initial information such as the name and location of an inventory item information to be added such as quantity of the item on hand would be marked in the ovals card punches with an option to detect mark sense cards could then punch the corresponding information into the card edit aperture cards aperture card aperture cards have a cut out hole on the right side of the punched card a 35 160 mm microfilm chip containing a microform image is mounted in the hole aperture cards are used for engineering drawings from all engineering disciplines information about the drawing for example the drawing number is typically punched and printed on the remainder of the card aperture cards have some advantages over fully digital systems for archival purposes 31 edit ibm stub cards or short cards the 80 column card could be scored on either end creating a stub that could be torn off leaving a stub card or short card a common length for stub cards was 51 columns stub cards were used in applications requiring tags labels or carbon copies 24 edit ibm port a punch ibm port a punch according to the ibm archive ibm s supplies division introduced the port a punch in 1958 as a fast accurate means of manually punching holes in specially scored ibm punched cards designed to fit in the pocket port a punch made it possible to create punched card documents anywhere the product was intended for on the spot recording operations such as physical inventories job tickets and statistical surveys because it eliminated the need for preliminary writing or typing of source documents 32 unfortunately the resulting holes were furry i e not cleanly cut owing to the perforations and sometimes caused problems with the equipment used to read the cards edit ibm 96 column punched card format ibm 96 column punched card in the early 1970s ibm introduced a new smaller round hole 96 column card format along with the ibm system 3 computer 33 the ibm 5496 data recorder a keypunch machine with print and verify functions and the ibm 5486 card sorter were made for these 96 column cards these cards had tiny 1 160 mm circular holes smaller than those in paper tape data was stored in six bit binary coded decimal code with three rows of 32 characters each or 8 bit ebcdic in this format each column of the top tiers are combined with two punch rows from the bottom tier to form an 8 bit byte and the middle tier is combined with two more punch rows so that each card contains 64 bytes of 8 bit per byte binary data 34 edit powers remington rand univac card formats a blank remington rand univac format card card courtesy of mit museum a punched remington rand card with an ibm card for comparison the powers remington rand card format was initially the same as hollerith s 45 columns and round holes in 1930 remington rand leap frogged ibm s 80 column format from 1928 by coding two characters in each of the 45 columns producing what is now commonly called the 90 column card 35 there are two sets of six rows across each card the rows in each set are labeled 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 the even numbers in a pair are formed by combing that punch with a 9 punch alphabetic and special characters use 3 or more punches 36 37 edit ibm punched card manufacturing ibm s fred m carroll 38 developed a series of rotary type presses that were used to produce the well known standard tabulating cards including a 1921 model that operated at 400 cards per minute cpm later he developed a completely different press capable of operating at speeds in excess of 800 cpm and it was introduced in 1936 6 11 carroll s high speed press containing a printing cylinder revolutionized the manufacture of punched tabulating cards 39 it is estimated that between 1930 and 1950 the carroll press accounted for as much as 25 percent of the company s profits 40 a punched card printing plate discarded printing plates from these card presses each printing plate the size of an ibm card and formed into a cylinder often found use as desk pen pencil holders and even today are collectible ibm artifacts every card layout 41 had its own printing plate ibm initially required that its customers use only ibm manufactured cards with ibm machines which were leased not sold ibm viewed its business as providing a service and that the cards were part of the machine in 1932 the government took ibm to court on this issue ibm fought all the way to the supreme court and lost the court ruling that ibm could only set card specifications in another case heard in 1955 ibm signed a consent decree requiring amongst other things that ibm would by 1962 have no more than one half of the punched card manufacturing capacity in the united states tom watson jr s decision to sign this decree where ibm saw the punched card provisions as the most significant point completed the transfer of power to him from thomas watson sr 40 edit cultural impact cartons of punched cards stored in a united states national archives records service facility in 1959 each carton could hold 2000 cards while punched cards have not been widely used for a generation the impact was so great for most of the 20th century that they still appear from time to time in popular culture for example artist and architect maya lin in 2004 designed a controversial public art installation at ohio university titled input that looks like a punched card from the air 42 do not fold

symbol of the system first the registration system and then bureaucratic systems more generally a symbol of alienation punched cards were the symbol of information machines and so they became the symbolic point of attack punched cards used for class registration were first and foremost a symbol of uniformity a student might feel he is one of out of 27 500 ibm cards the president of the undergraduate association criticized the university as a machine ibm pattern of education robert blaumer explicated the symbolism he referred to the sense of impersonality symbolized by the ibm technology steven 160 lubar 44 a legacy of the 80 column punched card format is that a display of 80 characters per row was a common choice in the design of character based terminals as of november 2011 some character interface defaults such as the command prompt window s width in microsoft windows remain set at 80 columns and some file formats such as fits still use 80 character card images
