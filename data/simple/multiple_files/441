century ad many sumerian late 6th millennium bc early 2nd millennium bc cuneiform clay tablets record prescriptions for medicine 6 ancient egyptian pharmacological knowledge was recorded in various papyri such as the ebers papyrus of 1550 bc and the edwin smith papyrus of the 16th century bc dioscorides de materia medica byzantium 15th century in ancient greece according to edward kremers and glenn sonnedecker before during and after the time of hippocrates there was a group of experts in medicinal plants probably the most important representative of these rhizotomoi was diocles of

in 754 10 under the abbasid caliphate during the islamic golden age by the 9th century these pharmacies were state regulated 11 unreliable source the advances made in the middle east in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval islam substantially to develop pharmacology muhammad ibn zakar ya r zi rhazes 865 915 for instance acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds abu al qasim al zahrawi abulcasis 936 1013 pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation his liber servitoris is of particular interest as it provides the reader with recipes and

practice in a variety of areas including community pharmacies hospitals clinics extended care facilities psychiatric hospitals and regulatory agencies pharmacists can specialize in various areas of practice including but not limited to hematology oncology infectious diseases ambulatory care nutrition support drug information critical care pediatrics etc edit community pharmacy 19th century italian pharmacy modern pharmacy in norway see also pharmacy automation a pharmacy commonly the chemist in australia new zealand and the uk or drugstore in north america retail pharmacy in industry terminology or apothecary historically is the place where most pharmacists practice the profession of pharmacy it is the community pharmacy where the dichotomy of the profession exists health professionals who are also retailers community pharmacies usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary where medications are stored and dispensed according to sharif kaf al ghazal the opening of the first drugstores are recorded by muslim pharmacists in baghdad in 754 10 14 in most countries the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation with requirements for storage conditions compulsory texts equipment etc specified in legislation where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding dispensing medications there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients prescriptions and patient safety issues pharmacies are typically required to have a pharmacist on duty at all times when open it is also often a requirement that the owner of a pharmacy must be a registered pharmacist although this is not the case in all jurisdictions such that many retailers including supermarkets and mass merchandisers now include a pharmacy as a department of their store likewise many pharmacies are now rather grocery store like in their design in addition to medicines and prescriptions many now sell a diverse arrangement of additional items such as cosmetics shampoo office supplies confections snack foods durable medical equipment greeting cards and provide photo processing services edit hospital pharmacy main article hospital pharmacy pharmacies within hospitals differ considerably from community pharmacies some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues whereas pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues because of the complexity of medications including specific indications effectiveness of treatment regimens safety of medications i e drug interactions and patient compliance issues in the hospital and at home many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy for example there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology oncology hiv aids infectious disease critical care emergency medicine toxicology nuclear pharmacy pain management psychiatry anti coagulation clinics herbal medicine neurology epilepsy management pediatrics neonatal pharmacists and more hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications including more specialized medications than would be feasible in the community setting most hospital medications are unit dose or a single dose of medicine hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition tpn and other medications given intravenously this is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel quality assurance of products and adequate facilities several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding the high cost of medications and drug related technology combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient care outcomes and patient safety make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible edit clinical pharmacy main article clinical pharmacy pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health wellness and disease prevention 15 clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics clinical pharmacists often collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care they often participate in patient care rounds and drug product selection the clinical pharmacist s role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient specific problems identifying goals of therapy and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient the review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of the drug therapy e g drug choice dose route frequency and duration of therapy and its efficacy the pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions adverse drug reactions and assess patient drug allergies while designing and initiating a drug therapy plan 16 edit ambulatory care pharmacy since the emergence of modern clinical pharmacy ambulatory care pharmacy practice has emerged as a unique pharmacy practice setting in 2011 the board of pharmaceutical specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification the official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be board certified ambulatory care pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials bcacp 17 ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs but rather see patients in office visits to manage chronic disease states in the federal health care system including the va the indian health service and nih ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority in some states such north carolina and new mexico these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority 18 edit compounding pharmacy main article compounding compounding is the practice of preparing drugs in new forms for example if a drug manufacturer only provides a drug as a tablet a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated lollipop that contains the drug patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead another form of compounding is by mixing different strengths g mg mcg of capsules or tablets to yield the desired amount of medication indicated by the physician physician assistant nurse practitioner or clinical pharmacist practitioner this form of compounding is found at community or hospital pharmacies or in home administration therapy compounding pharmacies specialize in compounding although many also dispense the same non compounded drugs that patients can obtain from community pharmacies edit consultant pharmacy main article consultant pharmacist consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review i e cognitive services than on actual dispensing of drugs consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non institutional settings 19 traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners though in the united states many now work for several large pharmacy management companies primarily omnicare kindred healthcare and pharmerica this trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and or provide consulting services the main principle of consultant pharmacy is developed by hepler and strand in 1990 20 21 edit internet pharmacy main article online pharmacy since about the year 2000 a growing number of internet pharmacies have been established worldwide many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies and in fact many of them are actually operated by brick and mortar community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door the primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take internet pharmacies also known as online pharmacies are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound while most internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription some internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the inconvenience of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe however this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications risk benefit ratios and an individual s overall suitability for use of a medication there also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products citation needed of particular concern with internet pharmacies is the ease with which people youth in particular can obtain controlled substances e g vicodin generically known as hydrocodone via the internet without a prescription issued by a doctor practitioner who has an established doctor patient relationship there are many instances where a practitioner issues a prescription brokered by an internet server for a controlled substance to a patient s he has never met citation needed in the united states in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor patient relationship the filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid often individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient doctor relationship canada is home to dozens of licensed internet pharmacies many of which sell their lower cost prescription drugs to u s consumers who pay one of the world s highest drug prices 22 in recent years many consumers in the us and in other countries with high drug costs have turned to licensed internet pharmacies in india israel and the uk which often have even lower prices than in canada in the united states there has been a push to legalize importation of medications from canada and other countries in order to reduce consumer costs while in most cases importation of prescription medications violates food and drug administration fda regulations and federal laws enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers rather than consumers there is no known case of any u s citizens buying canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription who has ever been charged by authorities recently developed online services which promote generic drug alternatives by offering comparative information on price and effectiveness edit veterinary pharmacy veterinary pharmacies sometimes called animal pharmacies may fall in the category of hospital pharmacy retail pharmacy or mail order pharmacy veterinary pharmacies stock different varieties and different strengths of medications to fulfill the pharmaceutical needs of animals because the needs of animals as well as the regulations on veterinary medicine are often very different from those related to people veterinary pharmacy is often kept separate from regular pharmacies edit nuclear pharmacy main article nuclear pharmacy nuclear pharmacy focuses on preparing radioactive materials for diagnostic tests and for treating certain diseases nuclear pharmacists undergo additional training specific to handling radioactive materials and unlike in community and hospital pharmacies nuclear pharmacists typically do not interact directly with patients edit military pharmacy military pharmacy is an entirely different working environment due to the fact that technicians perform most duties that in a civilian sector would be illegal state laws of technician patient counseling and medication checking by a pharmacist do not apply citation needed edit pharmacy informatics main article pharmacy informatics pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy however they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies as a practice area and specialist domain pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development deployment and optimization edit issues in pharmacy edit separation of prescribing from dispensing in most jurisdictions such as the united states pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians these jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public and that pharmacists cannot form business partnerships with physicians or give them kickback payments however the american medical association ama code of ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere 7 to 10 percent of american physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own 23 in some rural areas in the united kingdom there are dispensing doctors 24 who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription only medicines to their patients from within their practices the law requires that the gp practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified minimum distance currently 1 6 kilometres between a patient s home and the nearest retail pharmacy in other jurisdictions particularly in asian countries such as china malaysia and singapore doctors are allowed to dispense drugs themselves and the practice of pharmacy is sometimes integrated with that of the physician particularly in traditional chinese medicine in canada it is common for a medical clinic and a pharmacy to be located together and for the ownership in both enterprises to be common but licensed separately the reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest and or the avoidance of absolute powers otherwise the physician has a financial self interest in diagnosing as many conditions as possible and in exaggerating their seriousness because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient such self interest directly conflicts with the patient s interest in obtaining cost effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side effects this system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the u s and many other governments citation needed a campaign for separation has begun in many countries and has already been successful like in korea as many of the remaining nations move towards separation resistance and lobbying from dispensing doctors who have pecuniary interests may prove a major stumbling block e g in malaysia citation needed edit the future of pharmacy in the coming decades pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system rather than simply dispensing medication pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills 25 in particular medication therapy management mtm includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients such services include the thorough analysis of all medication prescription non prescription and herbals currently being taken by an individual the result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system 26 this shift has already commenced in some countries for instance pharmacists in australia receive remuneration from the australian government for conducting comprehensive home medicines reviews in canada pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights as in alberta and british columbia or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews medschecks in ontario in the united kingdom pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights they are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews in scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for scottish registered patients of their regular medications for the majority of drugs except for controlled drugs when the patient is unable to see their doctor as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable in the united states pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy 27 moreover the doctor of pharmacy pharm d degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation in addition consultant pharmacists who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients under the
