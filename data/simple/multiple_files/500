well established that this approach is effective but some feel it s rarely implemented 2 60 in 2010 the on site healthcare center saved the company an estimated 6 million 2 61 these benefits may also account for sas low turnover sas lost 3 7 of its employees in 2000 which is about one tenth of competitors rates 30 employees are given a large amount of autonomy and trust all the while being well compensated and well taken care of 30 in return for those benefits the company expects a high level of performance from its employees 30 as one employee put it here i know everything i do has an

organizational structure as sas institute has grown it has chosen to create new divisions instead of adding layers of management leading to a very flat and simple organizational structure according to fast company the sense of accountability at sas is so ingrained and the lines of reporting there are so simple that it doesn t need a formal organization chart 30 according to professor jeffrey pfeffer of stanford business school there are only three levels in the organization and ceo jim goodnight has 27 people who directly report to him 72 because the organizational structure is fluid the promotion process is not very significant an employee can easily go from software developer to project manager back to software developer in this system kurtzman an interview with jeffrey pfeffer sas also does not have a very formal evaluation process ceo jim goodnight says he evaluates staff on how well they attract and retain talent because he feels keeping and motivating the best talent will cause everything else to work out 72 sas does everything in house at its facility in north carolina every employee from the gardeners to the cafeteria workers to the child care center workers are all sas employees the company does not outsource anything this is because sas believes it is more cost effective and the workers do better work 73 edit management style at sas managers are involved not only in management but in doing the work itself side by side with those they manage in an interview in fast company an employee said my manager is doing what i m doing she is in the trenches writing code dr goodnight was once in the same group that i m in 30 according to a report in software business magazine this breeds respect among management and staff speeds up the decision making process and produces a flatter organization by limiting the bureaucratic middle men 73 there is a large degree of autonomy within the system and job descriptions are often very fluid this leads to employees being able to work on projects that they re passionate about and committed to 72 furthermore this is a significant deterrent to the type of alienation marx described because employees are choosing the projects and departments they want to work on edit charity and community sas institute provides free web based teaching curriculum to more than 50 000 teachers and 12 000 schools through its
