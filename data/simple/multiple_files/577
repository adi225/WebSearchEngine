december 2009 in linguistics a corpus plural corpora or text corpus is a large and structured set of texts nowadays usually electronically stored and processed they are used to do statistical analysis and hypothesis testing checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules on a specific universe a corpus may contain texts in a single language monolingual corpus or text data in multiple languages multilingual corpus multilingual corpora that have been specially formatted for side by side comparison are called aligned parallel corpora in order to make the corpora more useful for doing linguistic research they are often subjected to a process known as annotation an example of annotating a corpus is part of speech tagging or pos tagging in which information about each word s part of speech verb noun adjective etc is added to the corpus in the form of tags another example is indicating the lemma base form of each word when the language of the corpus is not a working language of the researchers who use it interlinear glossing is used to make the annotation bilingual some corpora have further structured levels of analysis applied in particular a number of smaller corpora may be fully parsed such corpora are usually called treebanks or parsed corpora the difficulty of ensuring that the entire corpus is completely and consistently annotated means that these corpora are usually smaller containing around one to three million words other levels of linguistic structured analysis are possible including annotations for morphology semantics and pragmatics corpora are the main knowledge base in corpus linguistics the analysis and processing of various types of corpora are also the subject of much work in computational linguistics speech recognition and machine translation where they are often used to create hidden markov models for part of speech tagging and other purposes corpora and frequency lists derived from them are useful for language teaching corpora can be considered as a type of foreign language writing aid as the contextualised grammatical knowledge acquired by non native language users through exposure to authentic texts in corpora allows learners to grasp the manner of sentence formation in the target language enabling effective writing 1 contents 1 archaeological corpora 2 some notable text corpora 3 see also 4 references 5
