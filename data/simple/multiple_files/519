advertising v t e search engine optimization seo is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine s natural or un paid organic search results jargon in general the earlier or higher ranked on the search results page and more frequently a site appears in the search results list the more visitors it will receive from the search engine s users seo may target different kinds of search including image search local search video search academic search 1 news search and industry specific vertical search engines as an internet marketing strategy seo considers how search engines work what people search for the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience optimizing a website may involve editing its content html and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks or inbound links is another seo tactic the plural of the abbreviation seo can also refer to search engine optimizers those who provide seo services contents 1 history

markets 7 legal precedents 8 see also 9 notes 10 external links history webmasters and content providers began optimizing sites for search engines in the mid 1990s as the first search engines were cataloging the early web initially all webmasters needed to do was to submit the address of a page or url to the various engines which would send a spider to crawl that page extract links to other pages from it and return information found on the page to be indexed 2 the process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine s own server where a second program known as an indexer extracts various information about the page such as the words it contains and where these are located as well as any weight for specific words and all links the page contains which are then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date site owners started to recognize the value of having their sites highly ranked and visible in search engine results creating an opportunity for both white hat and black hat seo practitioners according to industry analyst danny sullivan the phrase search engine optimization probably came into use in 1997 3 the first documented use of the term search engine optimization was john audette and his company multimedia marketing group as documented by a web page from the mmg site from august 1997 4 early versions of search algorithms relied on webmaster provided information such as the keyword meta tag or index files in engines like aliweb meta tags provide a guide to each page s content using meta data to index pages was found to be less than reliable however because the webmaster s choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site s actual content inaccurate incomplete and inconsistent data in meta tags could and did cause pages to rank for irrelevant searches 5 dubious discuss web content providers also manipulated a number of attributes within the html source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines 6 by relying so much on factors such as keyword density which were exclusively within a webmaster s control early search engines suffered from abuse and ranking manipulation to provide better results to their users search engines had to adapt to ensure their results pages showed the most relevant search results rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters since the success and popularity of a search engine is determined by its ability to produce the most relevant results to any given search allowing those results to be false would turn users to find other search sources search engines responded by developing more complex ranking algorithms taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for webmasters to manipulate graduate students at stanford university larry page and sergey brin developed backrub a search engine that relied on a mathematical algorithm to rate the prominence of web pages the number calculated by the algorithm pagerank is a function of the quantity and strength of inbound links 7 pagerank estimates the likelihood that a given page will be reached by a web user who randomly surfs the web and follows links from one page to another in effect this means that some links are stronger than others as a higher pagerank page is more likely to be reached by the random surfer page and brin founded google in 1998 google attracted a loyal following among the growing number of internet users who liked its simple design 8 off page factors such as pagerank and hyperlink analysis were considered as well as on page factors such as keyword frequency meta tags headings links and site structure to enable google to avoid the kind of manipulation seen in search engines that only considered on page factors for their rankings although pagerank was more difficult to game webmasters had already developed link building tools and schemes to influence the inktomi search engine and these methods proved similarly applicable to gaming pagerank many sites focused on exchanging buying and selling links often on a massive scale some of these schemes or link farms involved the creation of thousands of sites for the sole purpose of link spamming 9 by 2004 search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation in june 2007 the new york times saul hansell stated google ranks sites using more than 200 different signals 10 the leading search engines google bing and yahoo do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages some seo practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization and have shared their personal opinions 11 patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines 12 in 2005 google began personalizing search results for each user depending on their history of previous searches google crafted results for logged in users 13 in 2008 bruce clay said that ranking is dead because of personalized search he opined that it would become meaningless to discuss how a website ranked because its rank would potentially be different for each user and each search 14 in 2007 google announced a campaign against paid links that transfer pagerank 15 on june 15 2009 google disclosed that they had taken measures to mitigate the effects of pagerank sculpting by use of the nofollow attribute on links matt cutts a well known software engineer at google announced that google bot would no longer treat nofollowed links in the same way in order to prevent seo service providers from using nofollow for pagerank sculpting 16 as a result of this change the usage of nofollow leads to evaporation of pagerank in order to avoid the above seo engineers developed alternative techniques that replace nofollowed tags with obfuscated javascript and thus permit pagerank sculpting additionally several solutions have been suggested that include the usage of iframes flash and javascript 17 in december 2009 google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results 18 google instant real time search was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings with the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results 19 in february 2011 google announced the panda update which penalizes websites containing content duplicated from other websites and sources historically websites have copied content from one another and benefited in search engine rankings by engaging in this practice however google implemented a new system which punishes sites whose content is not unique 20 in april 2012 google launched the google penguin update the goal of which was to penalise websites that used manipulative techniques to improve their rankings on the search engine 21 relationship with search engines yahoo and google offices by 1997 search engines recognized that webmasters were making efforts to rank well in their search engines and that some webmasters were even manipulating their rankings in search results by stuffing pages with excessive or irrelevant keywords early search engines such as altavista and infoseek adjusted their algorithms in an effort to prevent webmasters from manipulating rankings 22 in 2005 an annual conference airweb adversarial information retrieval on the web was created to bring together practitioners and researchers concerned with search engine optimisation and related topics 23 companies that employ overly aggressive techniques can get their client websites banned from the search results in 2005 the wall street journal reported on a company traffic power which allegedly used high risk techniques and failed to disclose those risks to its clients 24 wired magazine reported that the same company sued blogger and seo aaron wall for writing about the ban 25 google s matt cutts later confirmed that google did in fact ban traffic power and some of its clients 26 some search engines have also reached out to the seo industry and are frequent sponsors and guests at seo conferences chats and seminars major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with site optimization 27 28 google has a sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on google traffic to the website 29 bing webmaster tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds allows users to determine the crawl rate and track the web pages index status methods getting indexed the leading search engines such as google bing and yahoo use crawlers to find pages for their algorithmic search results pages that are linked from other search engine indexed pages do not need to be submitted because they are found automatically some search engines notably yahoo operate a paid submission service that guarantee crawling for either a set fee or cost per click 30 such programs usually guarantee inclusion in the database but do not guarantee specific ranking within the search results 31 two major directories the yahoo directory and the open directory project both require manual submission and human editorial review 32 google offers google webmaster tools for which an xml sitemap feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all pages are found especially pages that are not discoverable by automatically following links 33 search engine crawlers may look at a number of different factors when crawling a site not every page is indexed by the search engines distance of pages from the root directory of a site may also be a factor in whether or not pages get crawled 34 preventing crawling main article robots exclusion standard to avoid undesirable content in the search indexes webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard robots txt file in the root directory of the domain additionally a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine s database by using a meta tag specific to robots when a search engine visits a site the robots txt located in the root directory is the first file crawled the robots txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled as a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish crawled pages typically prevented from being crawled include login specific pages such as shopping carts and user specific content such as search results from internal searches in march 2007 google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam 35 increasing prominence a variety of methods can increase the prominence of a webpage within the search results cross linking between pages of the same website to provide more links to most important pages may improve its visibility 36 writing content that includes frequently searched keyword phrase so as to be relevant to a wide variety of search queries will tend to increase traffic 36 updating content so as to keep search engines crawling back frequently can give additional weight to a site adding relevant keywords to a web page s meta data including the title tag and meta description will tend to improve the relevancy of a site s search listings thus increasing traffic url normalization of web pages accessible via multiple urls using the canonical link element 37 or via 301 redirects can help make sure links to different versions of the url all count towards the page s link popularity score white hat versus black hat techniques seo techniques can be classified into two broad categories techniques that search engines recommend as part of good design and those techniques of which search engines do not approve the search engines attempt to minimize the effect of the latter among them spamdexing industry commentators have classified these methods and the practitioners who employ them as either white hat seo or black hat seo 38 white hats tend to produce results that last a long time whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing 39 an seo technique is considered white hat if it conforms to the search engines guidelines and involves no deception as the search engine guidelines 27 28 40 are not written as a series of rules or commandments this is an important distinction to note white hat seo is not just about following guidelines but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see white hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users not for search engines and then making that content easily accessible to the spiders rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose white hat seo is in many ways similar to web development that promotes accessibility 41 although the two are not identical black hat seo attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines or involve deception one black hat technique uses text that is hidden either as text colored similar to the background in an invisible div or positioned off screen another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine a technique known as cloaking search engines may penalize sites they discover using black hat methods either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines algorithms or by a manual site review one example was the february 2006 google removal of both bmw germany and ricoh germany for use of deceptive practices 42 both companies however quickly apologized fixed the offending pages and were restored to google s list 43 as a marketing strategy seo is not an appropriate strategy for every website and other internet marketing strategies can be more effective depending on the site operator s goals 44 a successful internet marketing campaign may also depend upon building high quality web pages to engage and persuade setting up analytics programs to enable site owners to measure results and improving a site s conversion rate 45 seo may generate an adequate return on investment however search engines are not paid for organic search traffic their algorithms change and there are no guarantees of continued referrals due to this lack of guarantees and certainty a business that relies heavily on search engine traffic can suffer major losses if the search engines stop sending visitors 46 search engines can change their algorithms impacting a website s placement possibly resulting in a serious loss of traffic according to google s ceo eric schmidt in 2010 google made over 500 algorithm changes 160 almost 1 5 per day 47 it is considered wise business practice for website operators to liberate themselves from dependence on search engine traffic 48 international markets optimization techniques are highly tuned to the dominant search engines in the target market the search engines market shares vary from market to market as does competition in 2003 danny sullivan stated that google represented about 75 of all searches 49 in markets outside the united states google s share is often larger and google remains the dominant search engine worldwide as of 2007 50 as of 2006 google had an 85 90 market share in germany 51 while there were hundreds of seo firms in the us at that time there were only about five in germany 51 as of june 2008 the marketshare of google in the uk was close to 90 according to hitwise 52 that market share is achieved in a number of countries as of 2009 there are only a few large markets where google is not the leading search engine in most cases when google is not leading in a given market it is lagging behind a local player the most notable markets where this is the case are china japan south korea russia and the czech republic where respectively baidu yahoo japan naver yandex and seznam are market leaders successful search optimization for international markets may require professional translation of web pages registration of a domain name with a top level domain in the target market and web hosting that provides a local ip address otherwise the fundamental elements of search optimization are essentially the same regardless of language 51 legal precedents on october 17 2002 searchking filed suit in the united states district court western district of oklahoma against the search engine google searchking s claim was that google s tactics to prevent spamdexing constituted a tortious interference with contractual relations on may 27 2003 the court granted google s motion to dismiss the complaint because searchking failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted 53 54 in march 2006 kinderstart filed a lawsuit against google over search engine rankings kinderstart s website was removed from google s index prior to the lawsuit and the amount of traffic to the site dropped by 70 on march 16 2007 the united states district court for the northern district of california san jose division dismissed kinderstart s complaint without leave to amend and partially granted google s motion for rule 11 sanctions against kinderstart s attorney requiring him to pay part of google s legal expenses
